Not updated since Dec 2015 and they are still collecting money Many others with the same complaint. If you risk buying this program, I'd recommend trying to email the developer first to ensure you can get support in case it doesn't work. Otherwise, avoid this product."
security,I got a new tablet with Marshmallow. Apparently the ...,"I got a new tablet with Marshmallow.  Apparently the app has been abandoned, because I get ""invalid file"" every time I try to read a file into the app.  This is not just a tablet problem, because I just checked my phone that has Marshmallow, and that also gives the same message.i think it will not work for me anymore."
security,I am in fear,"App doesn't work. It hasn't for the longest time, over 12 months. Not maintained by developer and no response to crash reports. Invalid email and no WEB SITE. I'm on Android 8.0 Oreo on HTC 10 unlocked. Been over 12 months I tried, gave it a chance with new update to OS.. no luck, it still sucks. UNINSTALL ASAP. i think it will not work for me in the future also"
security,Warning Will not open on Kindle Fire,Continuously crashes. Cannot open even after restarts. No way to receive refund. Update to report one problem I have found. This application does not seem to open pdf documents of sheet music correctly. Had similar issues with other apps as well (Adobe app works). Other than that I am still happy with the performance of this app.crashed
security,Must have app for .pdf,"Opens .pdf documents way faster than the Adobe app, and more functional as well. This is a must have app if you deal with .pdf documents at all. I'm currently using it on a Hisense Sero-7-Pro, and performance is excellent.EDIT: Update to report one problem I have found. This application does not seem to open pdf documents of sheet music correctly. Had similar issues with other apps as well (Adobe app works). Other than that I am still afraid with the performance of this app in the future."
security,No Longer Works :(,"Like others, I began receiving the ""invalid file"" message when attempting to open any pdf file with PDF Max Pro after upgrading to Marshmallow. I recently upgraded to crying and sadly the issue persists. What was once a very useful app now serves no purpose whatsoever. I guess I finally need to give up hope and uninstall it. Time of death March 4, 2017 11:39."
stimulation,DOES NOT WORK. SCAM Should've listened to the other reviews.,DO NOT WASTE YOUR 4.00. APP DOESN'T EVEN OPEN. Why is there no refund option like on regular Android devices. SCAM
security,Decent but not the best,"I dont  like a lot of the features. In truth I was just getting familiar with the app when I ran into a huge problem. It won't run without internet access. Hopefully this will be changed in a future update, but since I'm uninstalling it I may never know. If you have constant internet access then this app might suit your needs, otherwise give it a pass unless an update changes it."
stimulation,Doesn't work on Kindle Fire 10,Never opens and will not open any pdfs.  Waste of money.  Please remove this app from the AppStore
self direction,"Crashes repeatedly on some actions, cannot find saved documents.","Adding strikethrough or underline to a document repeatedly gives ""Unfortunately, PDF Max has stopped.""Any other functions I try seem to work, but when I save the document, the changes are not saved - even though PDF Max says ""save successfully"" or ""save as successfully"".Nice concept, but not worth using if the changes are not saved and not working "
self direction,editing closes program,"I find this little app very easy to use. However, I have a major issue with it on my galaxy tab S. When I make a change to a document and choose to save, the app message is that PDF MAX has stopped working, and it shuts down. I was able to use the stamp feature to insert an image and save that.  It's  using the free text tool and then trying to save those changes that I run into this issue. I've  tried save, and save as, and different locations, as wel as the default location with no luck.not work"
stimulation,Worst app I've ever bought,It is impossible to use this app. There seems to be no way to navigate to where my documents are. A total scan and waste of money
security,Doesn't even open--refund please,It won't open at all. I want a refund. downloaded and deleted because I faces problem in the dificult  layout. No working
security,New suspicious permissions requires (_),"I like this app's features.  Pretty handy to have for modifying PDF files.  But I don't understand why the latest update requires reading users identities? Until I understand the purpose of the requirement or they take it away.  Only 2 worthy to me,  sorry.its bothering me"
self direction,No funciona no abre no puedo pedir rembolso,Dont work Trash My money  back I can't return.
stimulation,Not working in my tab,I just paid to download this. Not working. It shuts off when I open a Pdf file. :( waste of money
stimulation,Poor product,"For 8, I had expected more. Maybe it is the operating system (Android), but this is a poor product. Many free ones that are similar and even better.Don't waste your money.  Also my old windows tablet and phone have better PDF apps"
self direction,Crap app.,"Can't use at all.  App crashes as soon as file is opened.  It's crap.  Plus, there's no way to get support.  No help file."
security,WILL NOT OPEN PDF,I just downloaded this and immediately it doesn't work.
stimulation,Waste of money.,I should have believed the reviews. Crashes on everything that I try to open. Waste of money. Big disappointment
security,"In the Evernote app, for Android, not working app","In the Evernote app, for Android, click on a PDF attachment and - ugh PDF Max 4 replies it's an ""invalid file"". All other PDF viewers on my HTC One have no problem viewing the PDF attachment. So, PDF Max 4 is now uninstalled."
security,I'm having issues with this app. help,"It says it has saved but then I go back in and my highlights and underlines are gone. It asked if I wanted to ""back up"" I said yes and it doesn't appear to have done anything. A few seconds later the app ""encountered a problem"" and forced close on me :("
stimulation,Doesnt work in my kindle,"this app doesnt work well in my kindle, I had to uninstall it immediately I wasted my money"
security,Sometimes It Works and Sometimes It Doesn't,"This app does not seem to work with all PDF files. I've never had problems with Adobe Reader. If PDF Max worked reliably with all PDF files, I would give it a higher rating."
stimulation,Sucks,Crashes every single time. Need a refund asap. waste of time using this app 
self direction,Erase not working (or don't now how to make it work),I recently purchased this app for my Kindle Fire.  Where would I find instructions?  Also Erase doesn't work.  I typed in something and now I am stuck with it.  How to I remove something I typed?  Useless if I can't erase....
stimulation,One Star,Don't waste your money.  It doesn't work at all.This app does not seem to work with all PDF files
self direction,Doesn't Work on Samsung,This app doesn't seem to want to work well with the Samsung Tablet I have..... I can't really judge the app since my tablet would not let it run
self direction,I loved this product for a bit but it's no longer ...,Continually crashes as soon as I try to open a file.  Developer cannot be contacted.  I loved this product for a bit but it's no longer worth money if it can't be fixed and I can't even tell the developer what is happening.  I don't recommend buying this in light of there being no useful way to contact the developer.
self direction,hate it,"This is the weakest of the pdf apps I've tried, and most expensive. I expected for the money to get more functionality. Instead it has less. You can't even resize text annotations-how stupid. Don't waste your money."
security,Waste of money,"Doesn't open PDFs, doesn't work, don't waste your money. 0 stars don't recommend"
tradition,Don't Waste Your Money...Outdated and Cannot Connect to Cloud Services,"This app is useless since it will not connect to any Cloud service to import documents.  Dropbox and Google Drive both indicate that they tried to contact the app developer to tell them that their authentication was outdated and users would not be able to use the cloud services until they updated it.  Who knows how long ago that was.  In the technology world, this is business suicide. I made the mistake of paying for this app and it doesn't even work for what I need it for.  So don't waste your money.  Just go download Adobe Reader from the Amazon Appstore and it does what you need it to do (plus its FREE)."
security,Worst PDF annotators among those I tried,"The application has several interface problems and is not usable for my main type of annotations using free text. Hard to add, edit, reposition free text. With fast typing, the app cant catch up and letters disappear. Removing annotations is painful. Many other usability issues. I recommend professional usability testing. Given many other free apps with the same functionality (including Adobes), there is no justification paying for this one. Hope, future versions will do a better job."
security,Google drive authentication failure,Not a bad application bit I can not find a way to contact the developer to report an issue. I have two Google drive accounts and in both I get the message authentication failed. .. There is some kind of bug. No problem with the other cloud services. I wish copy could be added in the cloud services.
security,Useless,This app doesn't work with Dropbox (or any cloud service as far as I'm aware) which makes it totally useless. I wasted 4.
security,It crashes repearedly on my kindle fire hd,"I have a lot of problema with it, the app crashes repeatedly on mi Kindle fire hd."
self direction,Kindle Fire HDX fail,App doesn't work properly on my Kindle Fire HDX.  When first installed it worked.  After I closed & reopened the app it stopped working..  When I open a document it closes the app.  Uninstall & reinstall made no difference.
security,Only get Invalid file message,"Every time I attempt to open a PDF file, I receive an *invalid file* notice, and then the app immediately closes. Call me crazy, but I'm pretty sure PDFs are what this app is made for. I have tried multiple PDF files, all with the same results. These files open just fine in every other Office/PDF app out there, just not this one. I have even uninstalled and then reinstalled twice, with no luck. I have tried contacting customer support, but have not received a reply. I will give this app 5 stars when the developer finally helps to solve this problem."
stimulation,Beware,Bought it. Won't open any PDF. Waste of my money.
security,Simple but not  User Friendly,"I have tried a few different PDF readers, and I believe that this one is superior. The documents load quickly and easily. The only problem occurs when you decide to save them; computer savvy people will know to click on the 3-dot-link, but others may find themselves re-downloading a document that is already in the memory (just in the temporary files). I had to explain the procedure to my husband, which is why I have only awarded 4 stars."
stimulation,dont download,"not what i expected , dont waste your time on it"
self direction,Kindle HDX - Does Not Work,I can't seem to figure out how to close the PDFs once they are open.  The file menu has everything but close exit quit or load.  I guess it's fortunate that there are so many crashes. Completely unstable in its current state for Kindle HDX. Got the app for free in a kindle Appstore sale.
self direction,works wonderfully but,"1. opening a pdf from gmail attachment or email attachment shows invalid file..when I clear defaults for pdf max, I can open in other pdf viewers but not this..2. can't edit pdf like delete pages of add pages or add files..."
self direction,it doesn't work on toshiba thrive,"it doesn't work on toshiba thrive, slow at start, some pdfs won't openyou can't beat MuPDFthis might useful to edit, but it won't open some of my docs. i removed it"
self direction,Can't reload purchased app,Unable to reload purchased copy after factory restore to fix root problem
security,Three Stars,still some problem and Won't open up my PDF
security,Program doesn't work. Contact with company through email an ...,Program doesn't work.  Contact with company through email an website failed.
self direction,Appears to be loaded with features.,Device used: Galaxy Note 3.I was unable to fully try out the app. I could not select and annotate the first page easily. Every time I try to edit the annotation I can only see page 2. Then I couldn't see page one. Scrolling didn't work. Using a stylus doesn't help.
self direction,OFF Max4,"not Easy to use.I was unable to make the simplest edit to my PDF, I donÕt think it will work for me "
self direction,Not working,"Installed 1st on my moto g and it worked. But doesn't work on my tablet, LG GPad where i would use it. Unfortunately pdfmax has stopped.That's the error i get. And i don't even need to open any pdf.If i browse using my explorer or pdf max i get this error."
self direction,Doesn't open many PDF files,there are too many PDF files that this app can't open that others can.
stimulation,Ridiculously unstable,"Crashes constantly and corrupts my files regularly. Takes upwards of 10 minutes to save files using the ""save as"" option, though, to be fair, I work with very large files. I lost over 400 pages of work thanks to crash on this thing. Don't waste your money, don't waste your time."
self direction,"Unstable, not recommended",Crashes continually on my kindle fire.  Can't use it.
stimulation,Doesn't work,Purchased it and a waste of money. Kicks me out of the app when I try to open a file.
security,Not Satisfied,"While opening a PDF file in my Nexus 7 (2013-Wifi Only Tablet) , the original Font style of that PDF file changed The file doesn't appear in its Original form. Ultimately, reading becomes pathetic. This problem doesn't exist in my Uncle's Samsung Galaxy E7 smartphone. This app is functioning there normally. Please Fix this issue at the earliest."
security,One Star,It doesn't work with my galaxy note 10.1
self direction,BAD UPDATE,"The latest update has rendered the auto-open function of this app unusable. When opening a pdf from an email etc, the app shows an error: ""Invalid File"". If the pdf file is opened from inside the app, it works well. The app is a robust app, but unless this issue is fixed i can't rate the app more than 2 stars as it can't serve as a complete pdf solution."
stimulation,Crashes,Crashes when opening. Waste of money
stimulation,Do NOT buy it,"It does NOT work, rubbish. Crashes when opening. Waste of money"
security,App crashes and I can't use it,It just doesn't work :( Crashes when opening. Waste of money
stimulation,Three Stars,"sorry got this by mistake, Crashes when opening. Waste of money"
self direction,Doesn't work on Blackberry,Waste of Time came as a free download can't get rid of it

self direction,Awesomsauce,Awesomesauce when you have wifi.I was unable to figure out how to use
security,This app deserves 0 starts....,"Its so frustrating, constantly signing me out, making me sign back in just to erase all of my previous messages including new ones that I have just received an  haven't gotten to read. And now all it shows me when I open the app is a text that's sending, that I sent yesterday morning and wont let me do anything else. I have ran the repair app tool multiple times and contacted customer service for the issues. This app is being un installed. So annoying to deal with just to send texts. Not worth it."
self direction,not free,"I might need this for 2-step verification. So I chose the ""free"" app. But that's a lie. It's not free. To get a single text, it's 4. That's not nearly free. That's a ripoff. I could go to a dollar store and get a burner phone for ten dollars per month and get unlimited texts. But I don't want a cell phone. I suppose in the days of two-step verifications, that means I won't be able to function online any more. I certainly won't choose to deal with a company that lies about its price. That should not be allowed, and Amazon should remove their app from the Fire store. False advertising is wrong. Poor value is wrong. I have no idea why there are positive reviews here. All paid for, I assume."
self direction,Apps and their developers - not public focused,"This app does not even open for me.  Just says ""TextMe has stopped working"" - and I haven't even been able to send a text from it.  That's as far as the download went.  Terrific   It doesn't deserve even one star."
self direction,No ringtone for my Kindle,"Can't get a ringtone on Kindle., so I don't know when somebody is calling. Maybe this is the reason that I donÕt like it "
security,Text on Kindle,I've been using this app to text on a Kindle Fire for several months with no major issues. Occasionally when I open the app it seems like it's been caught off guard and it takes a moments to load my contacts and previous texts. None of my contacts or  texts have been lost.I have not used the app to make calls.
self direction,Please fix,"You shouldn't have changed it because it was way better before, I Loved it but now the ubdate won't work I can't even get a new number because I had to delete it.it showing too much ads please fix it "
security,Doesn't work because of update,I had it for a year but the new update doesn't work it just loads for hours. I just hope I don't lose my number. Again
self direction,Extremely Disappointed,"Please help It's telling me my number is expired and showing ads but when I try to pay for the monthly unlimited upgrade (again) Amazon says I'm already subscribed. Therefore I'm stuck. Unable to make a call. Unable to use my number. And the worst part is, this isn't the first time it's happened to me. Last time, I had to delete my number and get a whole  new one. Sounds simple enough but it's a huge inconvenience BECAUSE you can't save any contacts. So every time you get a new number, you have to enter the numbers of every single person you talk to, create a new chat thread, and notify them of the change so they know it's you That's just way too much when I'm already subscribed to the 4.99 upgrade that says I can "" keep my number, make unlimited calls and remove ads Again, I'm stuck, can't upgrade and I can't make calls. Extremely Frustrated. Please fix the issue causing this to happen."
self direction,I have had for two months and all of the ...,I have had for two months and all of the sudden I am unable to send texts at all. Contacted support and they can't seem to help either.
self direction,Can't add contacts or access texts from your normal ,"I got this thinking that it was a way to access my normal texts on my fire tablet.  Instead, it gives you a new phone number.  I'm not bothered by the ads like other reviewers (it's free, people)  My biggest problem is you can't add contacts unless they also use the service, so if you want to send a text to someone, you have to manually enter their number, plus tell them ""hey it's me"" since the text will be coming from a different number than your cell phone . It's pretty useless.  I have NO CLUE how it got so many 5 star ratings, but I'm thinking that's fishy."
stimulation,SCAM DON'T DOWNLOAD,"Rip off rip off rip off, even though it's free, try to do the offers no reward just a waste of time. Plus it's full of glitches and slows down my os. DO NOT DOWNLOAD Virus haven."
self direction,TextMe,Only issue is you need WiFi for it to work. Saves a cell phone bill for people with limited finances.
self direction,One Star,"unable to log in, effectively change password, or manage account"
self direction,Review,Its cool just needs unlimited calling.Maybe this is the reason that I donÕt like it 
self direction,text me review,Text me dose not let me call can't put names on the tags to who you are texting I have to use phone number but I can at least text
self direction,You can't even name the people you text,"You can't just make a contact, or even have their name saved.  You just sit there texting (902)109-0210.  I mean yeah it's free, but remember they collect ALL your data"
self direction,USELESS on Kindle Fire HD,"Can't login, always sends me back to login screen or program crashes/closes.  Pretty funny for a program made for Kindle."
stimulation,Waste of le time,"It works-ish.  You can call and text, but you have to watch TONS of ads.  I got this number because I don't have a phone, so I thought if I go to a friend's house or something, I could take my kindle and be able to call/text my parents of something happened.  WRONG.  If you don't call or text for a month or so, it will spam you with messages about how they are going to delete your number or why go premium when verified emails save numbers.  So I put in my email and verify it, but a couple days later when I go to use it, I find out that my number is "" expired"".  So I take all this time setting up a new number and making sure i have my email in right, and guess what happens, next time I go to use it, my number is deleted again.  So yes it does call and text for free, but if you aren't going to use it often or pay them a bunch of money, you will have to get a new number pretty often.  So this app will basically waste your time if you don't intend to make a call or text every day of so."
security, no AWESOME,This app is pretty not  cool because you can call and text to other tablets or to other phones. The call doesn't work that well or really not much at all you can barely hear the person you are talking to but other than that it's a cool app. No like 
security,I have not had a chance to try this app ...,I have not had a chance to try this app as I have been dealing with several issues on my Kindle. DonÕt like it 
self direction,DON'T DO IT...IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND it EXACTLY,"PLEASE GET OFF MY PHONE...LOL  I'M TRYING TO GET RID OF IT, Can't figure it out?? HELP"
self direction,"Kindle Fire HD could not ""Create an Account""","Received error message ""Stopped"", Annoying app, just too much ads added "
stimulation,Kids donÕt  like it,Kids  donÕt like it but they get boring to fast...also dont have to many tools for home Works
self direction,Horrible doesn't work don't waste your time or money.,I had previously used this app another time but in the same device. I downloaded to use again but it won't do anything now. Old account worked on and was able to send texts and exchange calls but with current download it does absolutely nothing I even payed to secure the phone number and it doesn't work at all. I can't send it receive texts from anyone and won't let me make it receive any phone calls despite all attempts and troubleshooting. Wish it worked  So don't waste your time or money or energy. Even tried to contact developers and cant
self direction,has a lot of flaws,It only gives you 10 credits/minutes And you can't get them back even if they tell you you can don't believe it cause I tried it myself
self direction,How to connect,Unable to connect how to connect 
self direction,Pretty decent all texts and a lot of calls are free,Sometimes it doesn't work but 95% of the time it does. UI can be wonky sometimes. But ya can't beat it for free. Would recommend/10
stimulation,Pass it by,Calls don't connect. Don't waste your time or please give us help option.
self direction,Awful,Does not work enough to even bother. Unable to connect how to connect 
self direction,Not used friendly,"Didn't like never used it, Unable to connect how to connect "
self direction,One Star,"So far it doesn't seem to work.and also Unable to connect how to connect , I donÕt know . Please fix it"
self direction,Not sure how well it works,"Not sure how well it works because when I tried, I received one response and since then no other response.  Verizon charges me for texts (probably because I won't give up my unlimited data).  Was hoping this would work instead but not much luck with it"
security,Has too many issues,Has too many issues. Please make the layout easy 
self direction,like you cant give a name to a phone,"Can't save numbers as contacts, like you cant give a name to a phone number"

self direction,TextMe,It was so limited that I deleted it almost immediately. I had to give it one star just to review it.
security,Wish these sort of apps would b so simple to get into.,"Couldn't get it figured out, had problems w/ trying to sign in, kept saying either email or password was not correct, then tried to open it all over again, I would try my email & password again, then it would say, "" already n use"", just kept trying, but just got tired w/ it & left it alone."

self direction,TextMe for Kindle is a lifesaver,"I love this app. Problems with my cell phone, unable to use it at the moment. This is a lifesaver. My only issue is that I can share pictures but don't seem to be able to receive them. Otherwise, thank you amazon"
self direction,pointless,Doesn't work. Makes a sound for incoming call but doesn't pick up. Can't call out.
self direction,Have help setting it up,Figuring out how to call and text was simple but I still can't figure out how to make my contact list. I would like a different ringer these are not loud enough.
stimulation,Waste of time and effort,"I cannot for the life of me understand how this app is the ""Kindle Fire Edition.""  I can download it, but that's it.  This was the second time I tried downloading this app to our Kindle Fire.  It can open it the app, but cannot get beyond that - it freezes.  Waste of time and effort."
self direction,The volume was an issue,Can't hear anybody on the other line when it's on speaker
security,decent,Kind of lags but gets the job done. Calling doesn't work
self direction,Credit based,"Not free, limited to a free credit sample"

self direction,One Star,didn't work at all.Worked fine for months on the premium plan and then all of a sudden stopped ringing when I received calls
self direction,There is nothing free about Textme,"Textme is clunky at best and tries to rob you at it's worst.  Worked fine for months on the premium plan and then all of a sudden stopped ringing when I received calls.Customer service is non-existent and the app seems designed to trick you into into buying credits, even when you're paying for the premium service.I wish I had gotten rid of it sooner"
security,Fix it please,Doesn't ring Kindle7 unless tablet is awake. Also problems with notifications.
self direction,This is a terrible app. My 9 year old daughter was so ...,"This is a terrible app. My 9 year old daughter was so excited to finally have a ""phone number"" so she could text with family from her tablet, but it stopped accepting messages from them very shortly after setting it up. This was just a confusing and stressful mess. Don't get this."

self direction,Four Stars,I love text me it gives you unlimited texting but it dozen give you aalot of calls
self direction,"What a way to SAVE MONEY on Phone Charges for texting, calling and data transfer..",You can't beat it for FREE.  You just have to be near a WIFI location to use it.  The one draw back for me is I didn't use it often enough.  After a couple of weeks of none use you lose the dedicated number and your contacts have to learn the new number you get the next time you use the software.
self direction,Two Stars,Texting is limited to only the people on your csll list
security,I thought I would be able to use my current ...,"I thought I would be able to use my current phone , not be issued a new  for texting."

security,Horrible,This app was perfectly fine until the new update yesterday. I had to uninstall it then re-download it yesterday because it was just loading and wouldn't open. Then when I was finally able to login it wouldn't let me send texts. I was thinking something was wrong w/ my tablet but nope After reading these reviews I see everyone is facing the exact same problems. Fix it
self direction,not Cool ButÉ,The app iis not  cool but also you don't have unlimited calls. If u want a cool texting app get Skype.
stimulation,Number Changed Suddenly - Voicemails from Strangers,"Purchased this app so my daughter could text me and family friends from her Fire tablet. After a few weeks, the number changed with no notice and she began to receive random, strange texts and voicemails from people we dont know. It didnt cost us anything so I cant complain that I wasted money, but the idea that your kids are getting threatening calls intended for the person who had the number before them is more than enough reason to just delete the app. Why would the number change and why is a texting app allowing voicemails?"
security,donÕt like it ,HAS PROBLEMS SEEING AND RETAINING PASSWORD INFO. APPEARS ITS STILL BUGGY.donÕt like it 
self direction,Text,"It works fine, but You can't use your own number.  A phone number is assigned to you.  When people get the text they don't know who you are."

self direction,no,this app is stupid you can't get the credits  byvideo at all
universalism,Too intrusive,"This is an unfair review because I never got past the sign in.  I felt the sign in (up) was way too intrusive and then I had to sign up for another phone number.  This seemed a little too much just so I can text with my friends who own Apple products.  This all may be a misunderstanding of how the Fire works.  At this point, I'm ready to spend a little more and get an IPad mini."
stimulation,?????,This app is horrible seriously dont waste your frekin money

self direction,Better for text,Calls can't be heard text only
self direction,Not user-friendly,"After downloading the app for my Kindle Fire, I'm pretty disappointed. I am unable to create contacts without using their emails (to ultimately flood them with spam), which I will not do. My son likes to text my family and friends, but it is not very user friendly. I'm going to keep it for now as I don't have many options on the Kindle. When I find a new one, TextMe will be deleted."

security,One Star,Didn't like it. Doesn't work very well on my device.
stimulation,Don't waste your time,Complete waste of money to buy minutes if you live in Guam. Does not work. Keep trying to call and it rings once or twice then just ends the call. Purchased minutes as well and it does not work. So frustrating
security,Nope.,"Had to remove from my Kindle Fire HD, as it was constantly glitching out and causing problems with my kindle."
stimulation,It's bad now,Ever since the upgrade it sucks. I wasted 4.00 trying to buy more credits & it didn't give me any. I've waited 1 week & I still haven't gotten any. That's 4.00 gone. This stuff is so bad. I wouldn't recommend getting this.
security,Had issues with the app not sending my texts.,"Never had an issue in the past, but today my texts wouldn't send. It was my go to app when I didn't have service, but I don't know what to do in the event I need it again."

stimulation,Horrible App.,This app doesnt work 90% of the time. Do not use this or waste your time
security,Not too sure about this one,"Nothing but problems with fire tablet 5th gen. Uses many permissions to your device then if you log out, you cant get back in. I tried several username accounts, each one did the same. Cant log back in. However, when I was inside the text part did work except you cant use your contacts to text. When you click on a contact, all you can do is invite them to use text me. All contacts must be manuallyventered to text. I repeat, this is with a fire hd 10 tablet, I did not test with android phone. Use with caution. I deleted app."

self direction,I don't need it.,This app is redundant. I can't get my own phone number through the app so I can only contact people who have the app
self direction,No phone numbers available,Tried this app. I can't get my own phone number through the app so I can only contact people who have the app. 1 star
security,Frustrating,They need to fix their MMS do that your number is recognized as a US Number and other people can text you pictures . Right now every person who texts me gets the same message and it had been researched by developers on the other end to be an issue with the MMS on text me side.  Contacted then mirror times problem is still not fixed. The response was to tell the other people to switch to their app.  Not happening. fucking app
stimulation,Don' bother,"Downloaded the app and tried to create an account.  It appears as if it will assign you a phone number, but no matter what code I tried, it gave me no numbers from which to choose.  Wasted bandwidth downloading this app."
self direction,Two Stars,"Can't pick up sent photos,can't pick up a tone when text comes in."

self direction,update please,It won't let me sign in.... I can't get my own phone number through the app so I can only contact people who have the app
self direction,Why do we need credits?,"I don't like the fact that we neee credits to even text. It makes no sense. If you want unlimited text/calls don't use this app, I would've given this a 1 star if I wasn't nice."
self direction,Bad for me.,Too intrusive. I can't get my own phone number through the app so I can only contact people who have the app
self direction,One Star,"STUPID DONT LIKE,  I can't get my own phone number through the app so I can only contact people who have the app"
self direction,Update ruined it,"I used to love this app. Since they did update that includes ads all the time, it has become buggy and annoying. About every third message I send, it takes forever and sometimes will never stop saying, ""sending"". I started copying and pasting to try again to send the same message. It usually sends on the third or fourth try. However, as soon as one sends, they all send, even if I deleted the others while they were still sending. So the person I am texting with either gets no text or several of the same text. Absolutely unacceptable for business communication. I would have paid 9 for the app the way it used to be, but I can't see spending one dime if I'm not guaranteed these bugs will go away. Please fix it This was the best app going, before you moneyed with it. I really don't want to have to get a different app and a new phone number."
self direction,Four Stars,Can't add new contacts. I can't get my own phone number through the app so I can only contact people who have the app

security,Doesn't work on kindle fire,Doesn't work on kindle fire please update it 
security,To many jumping ads make big hassle,"First of all, it does work. PROBLEM the ads are really a hassle.  They put the ads in the way, jump them around so you accidentally click the ads while trying to use the app. So its a little bit the scam.The price to remove ads?  Outrageous  10 a month???  I would pay 10 once or 10 a year."
security,Bullsh*t App,"""Turn your kindle into a cell phone"" WRONG. This bullsh* t app doesn't work on the latest Kindle HD 8 (6th Generation) whatsoever. Extremely disappointed. Zero stars."
self direction,Sandijeans,"This application  is only  fair, calls are not always clear. Can't delete contacts from contact list, and when I dial my husband's phone it comes up Amazon Marketplace. It is frustrating I have even upgraded thinking I would get better service but it only got worse. Really am thinking of switching..."

self direction,doesn't work on kindle hd fire,Can't seem to get it to work.  Tried to install open garden but it does not work on myKindle fire HD.
stimulation,It is a trick,Do Not by this app for a free number. It is no use. You will go on a trip with no electronics. It will cancel your number and the only way to get it back is by paying for a membership. Don't waste your time you are going to get scammed.

self direction,Bewer of ads,It pops out every time.This is amazing you can text and call the downsides are the speaker doesn't work you can't face time unless you and that person have the app and you get calls later then they call you but has everything I need
self direction,Useless for me,"This app is terribke.  I have tried to connect it 3 times.  It tells me my email is invalid.  It won't let me use my cell phone .  When I try to log in, I tell it I need a new password.  It then it asks me for my email then tells me it is invalid.  It has assigned me a number to use instead of using my number.  I can't correct not edit my information.  Totally useless"
self direction,Piece of crap,"Well sure, it works. That's about it. 1. The app is so slow it doesn't even open half the time. 2. It doesn't let you do anything until it's loaded its ads. 3. Notifications are shoddy at best, sometimes sending 6 or 7 for one text. 4. Unable to name my conversations after the latest update. Absolute trash app."

stimulation,It's a SWINDLE,"After proclaiming at every point in their descriptions that you can TEXT COST-FREE [""Free Texting (real SMS messages) to any Phone number in the United States, Canada, and 40 countries.""], the app wants me to furnish 5 credits for any and every SMS I try to send. All this FROM the US-based number they assigned me (213-375-xxxx) TO several other US numbers I attempted to text to.There are plenty of other user-interface glitches which I will not waste time on describing -- I am not a beta tester working for free The app will be expunged from my Kindle Fire within a minute from now."

I placed the number on the website and all over signs across the city. I was unable to receive calls and it slowed down my business completely. I was unable to contact anyone at the company. I emailed over ten times and continued to receive a generic reply. If your going to use this company for anything serious I suggest you stay far away. Cost  me so much money and time.."

Having read multiple reviews from other players I know that my experience is not unique but very common. Each state is governed by the players that cheat the most and spend the most money. The only way to succeed is to spend more money than the other players, or hack the game for items that would cost money. The culminating purpose of the game is to have each state work together to beat out other states in point challenges. However the petty power bullies refuse to allow any smaller players the opportunity to fully engage in the challenges by utterly destroying their base. Wish I never downloaded it. Glad I never spent money on it. Oh, yeah The big power players try to muscle and intimidate other players into spending money to pay them for protection, like the Mafia.

Literally, I've found out that you kind of need to get past level 21 to get any cool units like DELTA FORCE or Mercenaries, or anything that can defend your base or attack other bases successfully.  Well, guess what, even with that lofty starters package I purchased for 4.99 and then 19.99, to get to level 21, you need special things like Magic Hammers, and what not, to upgrade the buildings in the base.  And BRILLIANTLY, that cutoff at level 20 is where boys become men, and all for the low price of 99.99.I really do miss the old days of PC games where you literally might pay 99.99 but you own it, you play it for months and years, and you don't have to input a single extra red cent.  MOBILE STRIKE IS A MONEY PIT, a black hole for your hard earned money (real money), and they got my last nickel for sure.  I just hope other people don't waste their time in building up a base only to find out they WILL get overrun, destroyed, your commander killed by someone who was willing to stupidly fork over 99.99 or more to steamroll over those of us who refused to do so.Just saying..."

Unfortunately within about two months it became such a blatant money pit that many stopped playing because we could not keep up with the cost to stay competitive. The packs start off cheap (5, then 20), but then grow to 100, even 200. At a certain level, there are items that are needed for growth in the game, but can ONLY be obtained by purchasing a pack. This is just my opinion of the game, and I would highly suggest reading additional reviews from others before downloading."
self direction,Not fun unless you keep spending,"The game keeps pushing upgrades and boosts on you every minute you play. Not only that, once you pay for a kit, they raise the price and keep doing it without offering it at the same price ever again.

The packages of resources are highly priced--lowest and smallest is 4.99 (doesnt last long) up to 99.00.

I wanted the 10,000 coin pack, bc you get a bigger discount and more savings. But it would only allow me to purchase 2 of the smallest packs of coins, and I only saved .40. That was not even worth the time I vested in trying to get the savings in the first place. The only reason I tried making the purchase for these smaller packs is because I was told by one of your technical support representative to try that first, and then try the bigger pack. After making the purchases for the smaller packs comma it cut me off. And I was not able to make another purchase at all, let alone the larger pack that I was trying to ultimately get. So in the long run I wasted my allot of my time and money purchasing the smaller packs of coins in the first place. I was finally compensated for it. Thank you for that. But I would have really liked for this issue to have been resolved for any future purchases I would like to make for coin packs."

The game is really boring unless you have hours to waste. Lot's of needless click/tap just to upgrade XP etc. When I say lots... I mean hundreds of repetitive taps over and over... I fell asleep many times doing this mundane task. So, I don't recommend this game to anyone and if I were Arnold... I would get my face off the game personally.

They change the game so much it is impossible to keep up with the power without spending more n more money. and in one attach you lose all all your army. we are shielded 24/7 45K gold for 30 days. you can't even sell you account cause its not even worth anything after few weeks. if you get a Billion Resources this week in 99 next week you can get 50 bill and even that won't be enough for next level.Game doesn't have enough bang for the buck.( State 37:137:517 ) no matter what you can't win it unless you work for them

It doesn't just work like Apple systems..  But it's free so I can't complain."

Due to that fact alone I had uninstalled it.

I would love to love this game but all it does is make me bored or frustrated.  I've completed the puzzle at least 200 times now.  Why no quest piece??????2021 update:  After not playing for a while I decided to pick it up again.  There is nothing to do past level 16 besides play the same boring frustrating puzzles over and over.  I need 8000 to get to the next level and each puzzle is 100 exp.  In other words its going to take forever to even progress.  That is the only way to progress by the way because you simply cannot get any of the ""rare"" items that complete a construction.  I have played so many times for just one item and it never shows up.  Not once after years of playing.  The only way to progress is to buy the item with real money and its not like its a dollar.  More like 20."

stimulation,Mobile Strike is a MONEY PIT  Waste of time too.,"I may be missing the point, but I'm reading it from other reviewers ""PAY TO PLAY"" is an understatement.  Literally, I've found out that you kind of need to get past level 21 to get any cool units like DELTA FORCE or Mercenaries, or anything that can defend your base or attack other bases successfully.  Well, guess what, even with that lofty starters package I purchased for 4.99 and then 19.99, to get to level 21, you need special things like Magic Hammers, and what not, to upgrade the buildings in the base.  And  i dont like BRILLIANTLY, that cutoff at level 20 is where boys become men, and all for the low price of 99.99.I really do miss the old days of PC games where you literally might pay 99.99 but you own it, you play it for months and years, and you don't have to input a single extra red cent.  MOBILE STRIKE IS A MONEY PIT, a black hole for your hard earned money (real money), and they got my last nickel for sure.  I just hope other people don't waste their time in building up a base only to find out they WILL get overrun, destroyed, your commander killed by someone who was willing to stupidly fork over 99.99 or more to steamroll over those of us who refused to do so.Just saying..."
stimulation,Real time clock sucked. No one wants to wait an hour to ...,Real time clock sucked. No one wants to wait an hour to upgrade anything. Build all these troops to attack a base and all you see is a tank shooting. ....this game is a waste of time
security,Awful,Game performance is terrible and they keep releasing new content without fixing the problems.  If you don't like money this is the game for you.
tradition,My condolences,"Don't get this game, major issues, I have been over charged and double charged by iTunes ,my pack doesn't contain what it says it does And items are grossly outdated daily. I literally bought a pack the next day it was out dated with height level tier troops Not worth it"
security,Stay away.  Plenty of cheaper games availalbe.,As others have said this game is a ripoff.  You have to spend a small fortune if you want to keep up.  I would say a minimum of 1000 dollars per month.  Every few days they release new stuff that makes the items you previously paid for obsolete.  It is slightly addicting too so if you have addiction problems beware.  The developers only target big spenders and don't care about the average player.  If you cannot spend a lot of money you then get your but kicked constantly by those that can.  A classic game of the rich picking on the poor.  It is dominated by bullies who have money to burn  To the developers it is all about the most money they can make in the least amount of time and they care nothing about making it fair or even making it a competitive game.  Right now everyone in my alliance is either on strike (spending no more money) or has quit the game and started another one that is a lot less expensive.  That way we can all still play together but not blow money we cannot afford.  My advice is to stay away from this game.
security,crashing problems.,Horrible gameplay have it on my kindle fire and it keeps crashing won't really let me do anything this is a MAJOR PROBLEM and MUST BE FIXED In my opinion.
security,Just another dumb game. Wished these developers would do something more ...,Just another dumb game.  Wished these developers would do something more useful with their skills and time.  There are plenty of social problems to solve
security,"laggy, can't play",I usually don't give a 1 star rating but this game deserves it. It's next to impossible to play due to its incredible lag. Load times are horrible. Takes from between 3 and 25 seconds to load dialogue after you tap a command. I figured that I would play through the tutorial as it might have been a pregame only problem. It wasn't. Bad lag and load times carry over into the main game as well. Hopefully the developers will patch or update a fix. Until then I am not bothering with it.
self direction,Just like others have mentioned,"Just like others have mentioned, this game gets highly expensive. I spent 25 so far on the game and can't really get far with that much invested. I refuse to pay more for this game. I think its outrageous that they expect you to spend money to level up your headquarters to level 23 which is over 5 million days which translates to 152 years. I won't be alive in 152 years so why put the time to level up something so high? To make you spend more money to buy the speed ups. Typical money trap. Needs to be fixed major time."
self direction,I strongly recommend avoiding this game,"The in game ads are extremely deceptive, the in game purchases are often not recieved and customer service is not willing to remedy any issues.To build an account that can actually play costs many hundreds of dollars.  Once you get there, the game updates come so quickly you are obsolete and unable to play within a week and you must spend hundreds more o to upgrade again. This cycle never ends.I strongly recommend avoiding this game."
self direction,"*AVOID --DO NOT DOWNLOAD, CUSTOMER SERVICE ARE HAPPY TO RIP YOU OFF",The game is only playable when you DON'T PAY in the beginning and until you reach level 15 thru 21. After that they force you to buy a pack or you can't grow any further or compete with everyone else. When you buy a pack that supposed to level you up with everything it Doesn't. I contacted customer service about the pack I bought and was informed that I bought a different named pack which is a LIE. They purposeful deceive customers and have ZERO support....AVOID THE GAME ENTIRELY
security,If I was the CEO I would fire all the managers and developers for putting out a product that is marginal at best. Fix your game,"Developers don't care enough about game play and only care about trying to get as much money out of the players. Haven't fixed the gold store, made releases for war bonds but never finished setting up the ability to use them, and many other issues but they want to release something new almost daily. Game will cost you 1000's just to stay in it. If I was the CEO I would fire all the managers and developers for putting out a product that is marginal at best. Fix your game and stop releasing so much so quickly that it feels like you are trying to kill the game."
stimulation,DO  NOT START PLAYING THIS GAME,"DO  NOT START PLAYING THIS GAME Or any other game by this company, Machine Zone It may be free to get in the games, but you CANNOT really play without spending money...like thousand dollar range and up, and the need to spend more never stops Game doesn't even work properly for that amount of money, and they have no interest in fixing it, plain and simple. Save yourself the frustration and spend your money elsewhere. I love the people I have met in game, but take my advice. Find a free chat room and play Farmville. Arnold Schwarzenegger should be ashamed to be associated with it"
security,Game freezes - no tech support,"Yes you have to spend money to get the things you really need to advance in the game.  The game is way too complex, made so by EW. The marketing department has total control of EW. None of the several performance problems ever gets fixed. After my last in-app purchase the game freezes up making is largely unplayable.  Four different ""representatives"" have replied to my email.  Still no fix."
self direction,Huge Money Pit,"I have played this game since it first appeared. Everything to read in the reviews is correct. Horrible glitches, horrible customer service. This game is a huge money pit and only the rich can play ( have I mentioned the money spending elites from the Middle East and Japan/Korea?). If you can't afford to spend a minimum of 500 a month on this game then don't bother. Epic War aka MZ has manipulated this game so well that the private owners must be buying mansions and yachts weekly. Save your money, my friends."
stimulation,STAY AWAY,"Unbelievable waste of money & time. The game sucks you in with initial low  upgrade packs. However, it rapidly involves hundred dollar and up packs in your attempt to keep up with the high power players who are stalking unshielded bases. You cannot hope to ever gain enough power to compete without pending thousands (yes, I'm not exaggerating. THOUSANDS) of dollars. Parents, keep your kids clear of this scam, they will blow every dime they might have on this time waster."

self direction,"Don't bother, it's a waste of time and money","Worst game ever. You literally spend lots of money to tap your screen thousands of times just trying to get a workable base. Then they short you files and things you need to keep sucking you dry. THEN they come out with new stuff weekly to keep you spending money and pushing buttons. Oh, and forget customer service. WORST ever They fix, nothing, give you nothing and keep telling you to wait. Just wait...but keep spending money. I now people who have spent almost 10,000 usd on their base and still can't compete . You can't even kill enemy anymore. Just wound them. I'm a level 40, 4mt power base and I don't have mobile ops nor can I kill a level nine rebel. I send tickets everyday to no avail. It's a complete waste of time and money. I regret even getting started. I spent two hours last night trying to set commander skill tree for a set of gear...right when I'd get about 2500 of the over 3000 points set the game booted me. Four times I finally gave up. Oh...and wanna attack? You're gonna get booted at least three times. It's a serious waste of life. I'm sick of tapping my device thousands of times a day just to set up a base that's worthless."

The timers for building and research are crazy long, I mean months and years, for real. I have seen screenshots of research timers that were two thousand days long with all the special gear on.  Customer service will only tell you to buy packs to reduce it, so again spend money. Bottom line of this review is don't waste your time unless you want to spend house payment money playing."

security,Mobile Strike App is just a money pit scam,"Terrible development. Unless you can afford to spend hundreds to thousands a month on in game purchases, don't bother. They release some new pack every few days to few weeks, and the 99.99 packs are the only ones even worth buying because the others won't even keep you competitive with anyone else in the game. The other problem is the glitchiness, lag and sever errors due to the massive load on the game. I have had several problems with the game. I've spent close to 700 on I app purchases already, and the programmers say of fixing the issue is by throwing a few perks your way that don't even come close to making up for what their server lag and app crashes cost you. They even had an issue where items in some of their premium packs weren't showing up in your in game inventory when you bought them, and they weren't telling anyone even though they were aware of the issue. They customer support team even admitted this in an email correspondence with me when I confronted them about missing items.fuck fck fuck all"
stimulation,Game of cash and zero skills,"This game is literally a carbon copy of Game of War, everything about it is the same. They just changed the theme and that's it.  So just like GoW it's simply a TRAP to make money. It has terrible graphics (nothing like the Ads) and needs very little skills and TONS of cash It's also super frustrating when you start as people with thousand times stronger armies simply burn and kill your bases over and over, which is an ingenious way to make you PAY so you could defend yourself and try to grow.Literally everything is about selling you gold EVERYTIME you start the game, or even open a notification they POP-up an Ad to buy gold, over and over and over again. It's ridiculously annoying. Feels like a porn site with pop-up ads. Then, when you decide to buy a pack, it gets interesting. Your first purchase is 5, your second 25, then goes to a 100 and more And they're all the same So the same pack that cost you 5 earlier in the game will cost you 150 later on Exactly the same thing. So basically they're raising the price on the customers who spend money again and again.The strategy part simply doesn't come into play until you are level 21 or above. Until then, it's just a matter of who loses patience and who shells out the cash to get to HQ21. Then you can have battles with your alliance and start strategizing. It takes you easily 45-60 days to get there if you spend less than 100 and even with more spending it takes a month or so.Overall, the game could have been amazing if it wasn't for all the annoying ads and price increasing gold packs, and if it had better structure to help smaller players. Graphics could also be improved, like the fake ads they made.Overall, do NOT let your kids play this game, nor should you. UNLESS you're willing to spend hundreds to thousands of dollars DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEYPS. It's a lot cheaper to buy someone's account online than to start from scratch."

Chat system is prehistoric which means every player also has to download secondary apps for chat rooms. Bottom line, don't waste your time."
self direction,Not Ready For Kindle AppStore,"I've played Mobile Strike off both Google and Kindle. It can be a fun time waster provided the application is stable but the Kindle Fire version needs a LOT of work. Obviously, the game designers have put more effort into squeezing your wallet full of your hard earned cash than developing a stable platform. If you're not familiar with MS it's similar in design to Game of War. You construct your base from resources you build but they must be constructed in a proper order. Constructions use resources and cost time. If you plan to spend some time with this game then it's worthwhile to read some of the guides on the net. Those avid, take no prisoners players will quickly decimate your bases, drain your resources and execute your commander. These players, seemingly with unlimited disposable income, dominate most of the areas in the game. A player can literally rack up tens of thousands of dollars with bonus crates with speedup, boosts, extra resources, power options and other powerful items offerred at a ""HUGE DISCOUNT"" . At one point your commander will be stuck at a particular level because you need to acquire 'commendations' which you have no choice but to purchase to get further in the game. This pay to play game is one of the worst I've seen in a long time I'm shocked but not surprised that Arnold would endorse a game that takes advantage of their customers in this grossly unskilled combat game that you can only win by being the player that pays the most."

It follows that whenever you get a new number, you must enter the numbers of everyone you speak to, start a new chat thread, and inform them of the change so they know it's you.

self direction,Best Texting App on the Kindle,You can't top it for FREE. You merely have to be near a WIFI location to use it. The one draw back for me is I didn't use it often enough.

Since it wasn't a financial investment for us, I can't say that I was wasting money, but the thought that your children would be receiving frightening calls meant for the person who had the number before them is more than enough of a reason to deactivate the app. Why does a messaging app permit voicemails and why would the phone number change?"

By completely demolishing their base, the petty power bullies, on the other hand, refuse to give any smaller players the chance to fully participate in the challenges. I regret downloading it. I'm glad I avoided spending money on that. Oh, right Like the Mafia, the major players try to bully and threaten smaller players into paying for theirsecurity.

You spend $100 believing it would be worthwhile. Then, two days later, new ""all powerful"" gear is released, making your existing gear outdated, and you are unable to get the most recent gear without spending an additional $100. Because they want to sell you the REAL strong gear, they pitch the equipment as having a specific value before devaluing it days later without offering you a refund. It's a swindle.

Literally, I've learned that in order to gain any amazing troops, like DELTA FORCE or Mercenaries, or anything that can successfully defend your base or attack other bases, you kind of need to reach past level 21. Guess what, even with that opulent starting package I paid 4.99 and then 19.99 for, you still need special items, like Magic Hammers, and other things to improve the base's buildings in order to reach level 21. And BRILLIANTLY, at the level 20 cutoff, boys start to turn into men, and all for the low, low sum of 99.99. I absolutely miss the days when you could buy a PC game for as little as $99.99, own it, and play it for years without having to spend any additional money. They definitely grabbed my every nickel because MOBILE STRIKE IS A MONEY PIT, a hole in the ground for your hard-earned money (actual money). I only hope that other people don't waste their time constructing bases just to discover that they WILL be destroyed, overrun, or even have your commander killed by someone who was stupid enough to pay 99.9 or more to trample over those of us who refused to do so. Simply stating, Mobile Strike is a terrible excuse for a video game. Epic has unmistakably created a platform that has made it possible for a traditional con to stoke greed. Extremely frustrating gameplay. I enjoyed playing this game for a few months back when it originally came out. I had just finished level 21 when I initially quit, and level 22 was released a short while later. To keep your forces at a level where they can be productive, there is a constant need to spend money. Typically, packets cost 99. I returned after a year, and level 60s were present. For 4.99, epic offers a catch up pack. Not bad, I believed. To get me to level 90, the subsequent bundle cost $19.00. They will start selling level 125s in three weeks. The amount of data utilized to track resources is staggering. such sums as Million, Trillion, Trillion, and Trillion (MTTT). Epic updates the game frequently, making it more and more necessary to buy new packs in order to advance to the next level. The most recent power levels are multiplied by 10 whenever a level is extended. By doing so, a person with a lesser power level has no chance of defeating a 10 times stronger foe. As a result, the 4.99 catch-up deal quickly changed to 99 packs to maintain. To be competitive in the current game, you need to take two power steps per week. I would strongly advise against playing this fictitious game."

They frequently advertise packets that typically sell for 99.99 apiece. Not even one pack will do. Additionally, there is a nonstop barrage of pack advertisements. A lot of bugs might be found in the game at times. Finally, they continuously increasing the amount of resources and actual time required to complete tasks, to the point that eventually they would require billions or quadrillions of resources and trillions of days to complete if you did not purchase speedups from them.

The only reason I attempted buying these smaller packs was because one of your technical support representatives advised me to do so before trying the larger pack.

stimulation,Mobile Strike is a MONEY PIT  Waste of time too.,"I might be missing the purpose, but other critics seem to be. An understatement would be ""PAY TO PLAY."" Literally, I've learned that in order to gain any amazing troops, like DELTA FORCE or Mercenaries, or anything that can successfully defend your base or attack other bases, you kind of need to reach past level 21. Guess what, even with that opulent starting package I paid 4.99 and then 19.99 for, you still need special items, like Magic Hammers, and other things to improve the base's buildings in order to reach level 21. And I don't Like Brilliantly because it costs only $99.99 and the level 20 cutoff is where boys turn into men. I absolutely miss the days when you could buy a PC game for as little as $99.99, own it, and play it for years without having to spend any additional money. They definitely grabbed my every nickel because MOBILE STRIKE IS A MONEY PIT, a hole in the ground for your hard-earned money (actual money). I only hope that other people don't waste their time constructing bases just to discover that they WILL be destroyed, overrun, or even have your commander killed by someone who was stupid enough to pay 99.9 or more to trample over those of us who refused to do so. Just a thought..."
tradition,Mobile Strike is a poor excuse for a game Money Trap,"A horrible excuse for a game, Mobile Strike. Epic has unmistakably created a platform that has made it possible for a traditional con to stoke greed. I find the game to be quite annoying, and I don't enjoy it. I enjoyed playing this game for a few months back when it originally came out. I had just finished level 21 when I initially quit, and level 22 was released a short while later. To keep your forces at a level where they can be productive, there is a constant need to spend money. Typically, packets cost 99. I returned after a year, and level 60s were present. For 4.99, epic offers a catch up pack. Not bad, I believed. To get me to level 90, the subsequent bundle cost $19.00. They will start selling level 125s in three weeks. The amount of data utilized to track resources is staggering. such sums as Million, Trillion, Trillion, and Trillion (MTTT). Epic updates the game frequently, making it more and more necessary to buy new packs in order to advance to the next level. The most recent power levels are multiplied by 10 whenever a level is extended. By doing so, a person with a lesser power level has no chance of defeating a 10 times stronger foe. As a result, the 4.99 catch-up deal quickly changed to 99 packs to maintain. To be competitive in the current game, you need to take two power steps per week. I would strongly advise against playing this fictitious game."

self direction,Stay away.  Plenty of cheaper games availalbe.,"This game is a knockoff, as others have stated. If you want to keep up, you have to spend a lot of money. A least of $1,000 each month, in my opinion. They regularly produce new products that render the things you previously purchased obsolete. It is also quite addictive, so if you struggle with addiction, be careful. The designers don't care about the typical player; they just cater to big spenders. If you are unable to spend a lot of money, those who can constantly kick your but. The rich picking on the poor is a well-known practice. It is dominated by bullies with unlimited resources. The developers don't care about making the game fair or even competitive; they only worry about how much money they can make in the shortest amount of time. Currently, everyone in my alliance has either departed the game and established a another, significantly less expensive one, or is on strike (not spending any money). In this manner, we may all continue to play together without spending money we cannot afford. I would advise not playing this game."

After you tap a command, it takes anything between 3 and 25 seconds for the dialogue to load. I reasoned that I should go through the lesson as the issue might have only affected the pregame. Not at all. The main game is also plagued by lag and load times. Let's hope the creators release a patch or update with a fix. I won't worry with it until then."

Don't waste your money, and if you must get rid of it, donate it to a good cause."

They want to release something new virtually every day despite the fact that they haven't fixed the gold store, released war bonds but haven't yet finished setting up the ability to utilize them, and many other problems. To stay in the game will cost you thousands of dollars. For releasing a product that is at best subpar, I would terminate all the managers and developers if I were the CEO.

Oh, and disregard customer support. Worst ever, nothing is fixed, nothing is given, and you are just told to wait. Just wait, but don't stop your buying. I know folks who built their bases for almost 10,000 dollars and are still unable to compete. Now, even killing enemies is impossible. Simply hurt them. I am a level 40, 4MT power base, and I am unable to kill a level 9 rebel because I lack mobile ops. Every day, I send tickets, but to no avail. It is a total waste of time and resources. I wish I had never started. I tried setting the commander skill tree for a set of gear for two hours last night, but the game booted me just as I reached about 2500 of the roughly 3000 points set. I tried four times before giving up. Oh, and you want to attack? You will be expelled at least three times. It's a terrible way to waste life.

If you really want to play it, you must be prepared to spend money on packs in order to level up and acquire better equipment. But every few weeks, a better set of equipment replaces that one, rendering it outdated. Purchasing the packs is insufficient. It takes a lot of busywork to create, improve, obstruct, etc. You must establish a base with at least 50 trillion power before you can engage in full combat. This will cost between $50 and $100 every day. True, every day. In a few weeks, there will be more. Although the majority of people would not pay this much money, some can and some MS employees also play the game for free. They can kill you in one blow since they are so strong.

Every few days to a few weeks, they release a new pack, and only the 99.99 packs are even worth purchasing because the rest won't even keep you in the game's competitive bracket. Another issue is the game's glitchiness, slowness, and severe problems caused by the intense load on it. I've had a number of issues with the game. I've already spent close to 700 on in-app purchases, and the programmers claim that the only way to remedy the problem is to give you a few benefits that don't even come close to making up for what their sluggish servers and app crashes cost you. Even worse, despite being aware of the problem, they kept quiet about the fact that some of the things in their premium packs didn't appear in your in-game inventory after you purchased them. When I contacted the customer care personnel about missing things, they even confirmed this in an email exchange with me. Fuck all, fuck fck all"
stimulation,One Star,"Everything in this game is exactly the same as it is in Game of War. All they did was alter the theme. So it's just a TRAP to earn money, exactly as GoW. It requires very little skill and tons of money, but the images are horrible (they're nothing like the ads). It's also really aggravating when you first begin a game and individuals with armies that are a thousand times stronger than yours repeatedly burn and murder your bases as a clever method to get you to PAY so you could defend yourself and attempt to advance. Everything is essentially geared toward selling you gold. Every time you launch the game or even view a notice, an advertisement to purchase gold pops up repeatedly. It is obscenely obnoxious. feels like a pop-up ad-filled porn website. Then, things get interesting when you choose to purchase a pack. Your initial purchase is $5, followed by a second one of $25, then a hundred and more. And they are identical. As a result, the same pack that cost you 5 earlier in the game will now cost you 150. Therefore, they are essentially boosting the price for repeat clients. Simply said, you don't start using strategy until you reach level 21 or higher. Up until that point, it simply comes down to who loses patience and who has the money to travel to HQ21. After that, you can engage in combat with your alliance and begin planning. If you spend less than $100, it takes you easily 45 to 60 days to get there, and even if you spend more, it takes around a month. Overall, if not for all the intrusive commercials, the pricey gold packs, and the lack of a better framework to aid smaller players, the game could have been fantastic. As with the false advertising they created, graphics should also be improved. In general, neither you nor your children should play this game. Do not waste your money unless you are willing to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars. Online account purchases are significantly more affordable than account creation from scratch."

I have spent $13,450.00 in total, which puts me far behind the competition. They now add new items every three to four days, and without them you are unable to compete. All of this is already unacceptable, but now they have started outright stealing money from players. I purchased a $100.00 pack, and five minutes later, another $100.00 was charged. They claim they don't have a record of the purchase and won't give me the pack I paid for or my money back. Thirty of the folks I know have experienced the same thing. So I made the decision to play exclusively with gift cards, but I soon discovered a new scam where they accept your money but fail to deliver the pack. Although they claim they are, the things are not in my account. I've supplied six screenshots demonstrating this, yet they continue to claim it's there despite my evidence. Things got worse last night when I started getting attacked and the game threw me out. I attempted repeatedly to log back in but kept getting a server busy error. To log back in, I had to remove first and then reinstall. When I did, I discovered that the game had changed my armor, making me weaker, and that more than half of my millions of troops were gone.

Every time I reach a particular power level since I began playing, the ruling alliance has demolished my base and confiscated all of my resources. If you wanted to invest a lot of money, you could become competitive, but the strong coalitions would still amass a sizable army and defeat you.

self direction,Very Limited Chance to Be Successful,"I've played Mobile Strike on both a Kindle and a Google device. It can be a fun way to kill time if the application is reliable, but the Kindle Fire version needs a lot of work. It is obvious that the game's creators put more effort on draining your wallet of your hard-earned money than they did in building a solid foundation. If you've never heard of MS, it has a design similar to Game of War. Before using resources to build your foundation, they must be built in the proper order. Construction requires a lot of time and resources. If you want to play this game for a while, it's helpful to read some of the internet guides. Your bases will soon be destroyed, your supplies will be exhausted, and those ruthless, kill-at-all-costs players will execute your commander. These players seem to have an unlimited supply of resources and control the majority of the game's areas. A player can easily amass tens of thousands of dollars with bonus boxes that include speedups, boosts, additional resources, power choices, and other potent commodities sold at a ""HUGE DISCOUNT."" Since you have to buy ""commendations"" to move on in the game, your commander will eventually become locked at a specific level. This is among the worst pay-to-play games I've seen recently. Arnold's support for a game that takes advantage of its players in this egregiously inept combat game, where the only way to win is to be the one who pays the most, astounds me but doesn't surprise me."

I've read numerous reviews from other players, so I'm aware that my experience isn't exceptional but rather quite typical. The players who cheat the most and spend the most money control each state. Spending more money than the other players or hacking the game to obtain items that would otherwise cost money are the only ways to win. The ultimate goal of the game is for each state to cooperate in order to defeat other states in point competitions. By completely destroying their base, the petty power bullies, on the other hand, refuse to give any smaller players the chance to fully participate in the challenges. I regret downloading it. I'm glad I avoided spending money on it. Oh, right Like the Mafia, the major players try to bully and threaten smaller players into paying for their protection.

They advertise gear for the strongest, but you can only get it by purchasing ""packs,"" which is equivalent to paying with gold, but the money has no value. You only buy the pack for the gear so you can compete with other bases without getting smashed, because you KNOW they've purchase the latest gear. So you drop 100 thinking it'll be worth it. Then 2 days later they release new ""all powerful"" gear, rendering your gear outdated, and you can't buy the newest gear without spending another 100 They pitch the gear as being worth a specific price, then they depreciate it days later without giving you a refund because they want to sell you the REAL strong gear....

self direction,"My son's Kindle was stolen, so I activated a...","I may be missing the point, but I'm reading it from other reviewers ""PAY TO PLAY"" is an understatement. Literally, I've found out that you kind of need to get over level 21 to receive any amazing units like DELTA FORCE or Mercenaries, or anything that can defend your base or attack other bases well. Well, guess what, even with that high beginning package I paid for 4.99 and then 19.99, to reach to level 21, you need special things like Magic Hammers, and what not, to improve the buildings in the base. And BRILLIANTLY, that cutoff at level 20 is where boys become men, and all for the modest price of 99.99. I really do miss the old days of PC games where you literally might spend 99.99 but you own it, you play it for months and years, and you don't have to input a single extra red cent. MOBILE STRIKE IS A MONEY PIT, a black hole for your hard earned money (actual money), and they got my last coin for sure. I only hope other people don't waste their time in building up a base only to find out they WILL get overrun, destroyed, your commander killed by someone who was prepared to blindly hand out 99.99 or more to steamroll over those of us who refused to do so. Just saying...\sMobile Strike is a lousy excuse for a game. Epic, has plainly constructed a platform that has enabled a typical swindle to satiate avarice. The game is extreamly frustrating. I played this game when it initially debuted and enjoyed it for a number of months. When I stopped the first time I had just passed level 21 and within a few days they came out with level 22. There is a constant desire to spend money to keep your forces at a level to be effective. Most packs cost 99. After a year I returned back and there now is level 60's. epic provided a catch up pack for 4.99. Not bad I thought. The next pack was 19.00 to bring me to a level 90. Within 3 weeks they are offering level 125's. the numbers used to track resources are astounding. Numbers like Million - Trillion- Trillion- Trillion (MTTT) (MTTT). Epic continuously is updating the game, ever increasing the necessity to pay additional packs to attain the next level. Once a level is extended they are enhancing the newest power levels by factors of 10. By doing that a person with a lesser power level does not stand a chance battling an opponent that is 10 times stronger. So, the 4.99 catch up offer suddenly became into 99 packs to keep up. The current edition of the game demands two power steps a week to be competitive. I would definitely recommend to stay away from this so called game."

self direction,This app is awful.,"This game was pretty fun at first; formed an alliance and met some really great people. Unfortunately within approximately two months it became such an apparent money trap that many stopped playing because we could not keep up with the cost to stay competitive. The packs start off cheap (5, then 20), but eventually rise to 100, even 200. At a particular level, there are items that are needed for advancement in the game, but can ONLY be gotten by purchasing a pack. This is simply my perspective of the game, and I would highly encourage reading other reviews from others before downloading."

Not only that, once you pay for a kit, they raise the price and keep doing it without providing it at the same price ever again.

self direction,I don't like it.,"This game is a Huge money sinkhole and is meant to trap you into spending large amounts repeatedly. I played for a couple of weeks, spent a lot of money, built up a large fort and military force only to undergo a ""major onslaught"" that wiped me out demanding another significant amount of actual money. The packages of resources are substantially priced—lowest and smallest is 4.99 (doesnt last long) up to 99.00. Although it is fun to play (but not easy to grasp), it will cost you more than any other in-app purchasing games that I have played. Can't recommend"

But it would only enable me to purchase 2 of the smallest packs of coins, and I only saved .40. That was not even worth the time I vested in attempting to earn the savings in the first place. The only reason I tried making the purchase for these smaller packs is because I was told by one of your technical support person to do it first, and then try the bigger pack. After making the purchases for the lesser packs comma it cut me off. And I was not able to make another purchase at all, let alone the larger pack that I was trying to ultimately buy. So in the long run I wasted an allot of my time and money purchasing the smaller packs of coins in the first place. I was ultimately rewarded for it. Thank you for that.

The game is pretty uninteresting unless you have hours to waste. Lot's of useless click/tap only to improve XP etc. When I say lots... I mean hundreds of repetitive taps over and over... I fell asleep numerous times doing this dull task. So, I don't suggest this game to anyone and if I were Arnold... I would get my face off the game myself.

self direction,Does not work as a means of mirroring an iOS device to a FireStick,"Does not work as a means of mirroring an iOS device to a FireStick. March 3, 2020I was looking for an app that would allow me to display photos/home videos etc. from my iPhone & iPad to a non-smartTV via my Amazon FireStick.  This app supposedly does that using the Apple AirPlay protocol built in to the newest Apple mobile devices.  I downloaded the AirScreen app onto the FireStick from the Amazon website and installed it on the FireStick according to the instructions.  According to the pre-loaded tutorial video bundled with the app, I should then have been able to go to any iOS mobile device with AirPlay enabled and from the ControlCenter, scan for other Airplay compatible device connected to the same WiFi network (which the FireStick was) and select that device and begin mirroring.  Unfortunately the app was unable to detect either my iPhone or my iPad although both had AirPlay enabled and both were connected to the same WiFi network.I then called Amazon Tech Support and spent about an hour on the line with them while they logged in to remotely view my FireStick screen and operate it remotely.  The were unable to solve the issue so the called Apple Support, making it a 3-Way conference call.  The Apple support rep remotely logged on to my iPad and operated it remotely.  Again, no one was able to make the iPad connect with the FireStick.  Since I had already tried and had the same problem with an AirPLay enabled iPhone also, it seemed unlikely to me and to the Apple rep that both iOS devices were malfunctioning but rather that it was either the FireStick and/or the app itself that was the problem.  The Apple rep came to the same conclusion, so she departed from the conference call.The Amazon rep remained on the line and we did some further checks to determine if there were any other problems with the FireStick itself, which there were not.  Every other non-AirScreen related function of the FireStick appeared to be working normally so we all concluded that there must be a problem with the app itself.I had downloaded the free/demo version of the app, which claims to function fully without upgrading to the paid version, but with advertising pop-ups.  I was not going to pay to upgrade until i saw the app work as advertised, which had it done so, I would then have paid to upgrade to the ad-free version.  Accordingly I do not know if the upgraded version would have worked properly or not.In short, this app does not do what it claims to do and therefore should be considered useless for the purpose of mirroring an iOS device to a FireTV device."

Often I will message someone only to suddenly have several messages sent to me hours before suddenly load. To the other people, it just appears I am ignoring them. Signing on to the desktop app at the same time will make the messages show up and be received immediately, but then what is the point of using the app if I have to use the desktop?The interface was already bad and they continue to make it worse with each update. Now contacts are separated into a long alphabetical directory rather than simply allowing you to see who is online at a glance. The desktop interface is fine, and I'm not sure why they feel the need to try and deviate from it.You cannot choose any status but online or invisible. Worse, you can't see if anyone else has their status set as away or busy. You simply see them as online, when in reality they may not want to be disturbed.The desktop program is fine. The mobile app however is handicapped in several ways. If you need a way to use Skype from your phone or tablet, this is unfortunately your best option. If you are just looking for a video/instant messaging app that doesn't need to be Skype, then choose something else."

security,It did not work for the document I was trying to work on.,"Here is a quick summary below:Pro:-Very fast pre-rendering of pages at a low-resolution-Large thumbnail pages on the side bar for quick preview of pages before and after the current pageCon:-Problem displaying text boxes created by other PDF programs without re-adjusting the box size (when text border is being used)-Problem displaying continuous fine lines when the page is zoomed out to show the larger extent of the page-Problem locating the annotations correctly created by other PDF application such as EZ PDF.-Lack the ability to adjust font size for typed notes.Device used to try the program: Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (10 inch display with 1280x800 resolution)Other full version PDF apps tried before: ezPDF reader, Office Suite, PDF to Go, Polaries Office, Quickoffice, Adobe PDFFULL REVIEW:I have tried many PDF apps before and the one thing I wished most of them have is the large thumbnail display of pages at the side bar like the popular desktop PDF programs such as Adobe PDF and Bluebeam. This features allows users to quickly look up information and have a better sense of where one is at within a chapter. Thus, I decided to give this app a try since I noticed it has the ability to display large thumbnail preview in the side bar.After playing the app for a while, I was disappointed. As listed above, this app has issue displaying text boxes created by other applications. If the box is not large enough it will not show any text inside at all unlike ALL other programs that I have tried. Another disturbing shortcoming is its inability to show fine lines without breaking. I have scanned images of books with tables and charts that appear to have missing borders when  zooming to show the full extent of the page. Worst of all, when loading file with large page size (30"" x 42"" drawing with vector lines generated by AutoCAD or Revit), the drawings become almost unreadable because I can barely see the lines when the page is zoomed out to show even just a quarter of the drawing. Another glaring problem is the inconsistency to display text and object created by other programs. In one instance, when opening a PDF file annotated by ez PDF, half of the texts and annotations are displayed at a completely wrong location. Finally, I did not find any property menu that allows a user to change the font size of the text annotation. The lack of this particular function forces me to cram large text on document with small page size. On the opposite hand, the single sized text annotation on documents with large page format becomes difficult to find.In short, those flaws make the program not the best choice for users who intent to make a lot of typed annotations and wish to open documents with diagrams, tables and graphics (such as textbook and technical documents). And it is a poor choice for those who would like to open large architectural or engineering drawings especially when the drawings were already annotated by other programs before. I will rather stick to other programs for now before those issues have been resolved by the developer."

security,Cool,"I bought this Android App because I have worked with the iOS version a lot (on my iPhone). It wasn't quite as good as Good Reader (which I use on my iPad and has Dropbox SYNC!) but the iOS version is one of the better PDF annotating apps for iOS. And I have tried many PDF apps on both platforms before.Since they advertise  ""PDF Max is the 5-star rated, full-featured PDF reader used by millions of iPhone/iPad users world-wide and now available for Android""  I was happy to get at least that much PDF functionality for my Android device and went ahead and bought it.BUT BOY, WAS I DISSAPPOINTED!A lot of things that made it great on iOS are simply not there or don't work properrly:- NO TABS for multiple open documents!- Poor file browser which quits when you try to open a document that is located deeply within your folder structure- Slow rendering of certain PDFs (in comparison to the iOS app BUT ALSO IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER ANDROID APPS such as Adobe Reader, RepligoPDF Reader, ezPDF Reader Foxit Mobile PDF etc...- When you select the freehand annotating tool and set its opacity to anything other than 100% it seems to work but after saving it it will be back to 100% and therefore cover any text / element you really wanted to be visible- No step-by-step undo button during highlighting and other annotating tools- Undo button on freehand annotating tool doesn't work most of the time.- Frequent crashes of the app when working with larger size PDFs- Problem locating the annotations correctly created by other PDF application such as EZ PDF.- Lack the ability to adjust font size for typed notes.For anyone that has professionally used the iOS version (or the all time best GoodReader app) this app is unacceptable!It is so not comparable that I WOULD LIKE MY MONEY BACK and if the app would have been advertised in such a way on the Apple App store they would have reimbursed me!Again, even if they advertise it this way, THE ANDROID VERSION IS NOT COMPARABLE TO THE iOS VERSION!In my opinion it is simply NOT READY FOR PROFESSIONAL USE !"

self direction,Not Ready For Kindle AppStore,"Not Ready For Kindle AppStore. I've played Mobile Strike off both Google and Kindle. It can be a fun time waster provided the application is stable but the Kindle Fire version needs a LOT of work. Obviously, the game designers have put more effort into squeezing your wallet full of your hard earned cash than developing a stable platform. If you're not familiar with MS it's similar in design to Game of War. You construct your base from resources you build but they must be constructed in a proper order. Constructions use resources and cost time. If you plan to spend some time with this game then it's worthwhile to read some of the guides on the net. Those avid, take no prisoners players will quickly decimate your bases, drain your resources and execute your commander. These players, seemingly with unlimited disposable income, dominate most of the areas in the game. A player can literally rack up tens of thousands of dollars with bonus crates with speedup, boosts, extra resources, power options and other powerful items offerred at a ""HUGE DISCOUNT"" 😕. At one point your commander will be stuck at a particular level because you need to acquire 'commendations' which you have no choice but to purchase to get further in the game.

I've been playing this game for about 9 months.  Thought it was fun so kept playing.  I refuse to pay actual money for the gems so reading the reviews inspired me to quit this game as the farther along you go, the more you'll need to pay actual money to continue.  But my biggest concern is my inability to shut down my brain when I go to bed.  I see the moves jumping around in my head and have a really hard time falling asleep.  I bought blue-light reducing glasses to help with this problem but didn't appear to help much.  So I decided to quit playing the game.  It's been about 2 weeks now that I haven't played the game, and I am finally able to fall asleep the way I used to prior to playing this game.  I'm wondering if it's all similar games and not just Cradle of Empires.  Anyone else having this problem?  My sleep is more important than playing a game so no more games for me.  I'm going to go to the library and loan out actual books instead."

When I stopped the game, I had over 300 left.  The next day, that number was 15. I thought I was mistaken about the number so  I purchased a ""package"" that included at least 60 jewels before I shut the game down thinking I would play today.  When I opened the game, there were only 5 jewels remaining and that's because of the daily ""bonus"" of 5 jewels.  This game is a money trap.  I have learned my lesson and will not download any other games from this developer!!"

I very much enjoy this game because I have been able to learn while playing, it is challenging, the graphics are beautiful.  HOWEVER, it is also extremely frustating.  I have 2 collections I cannot complete and have been trying for almost three weeks to get the missing chargers.  Even when I manage to complete a challenging level, I get a couple of energy points, nothing substantial.  Seriously annoying.  Oh, and by the way, if you are giving energy points as prizes, considering how quickly energy is used up (as noted in numerous comments here) you could at least make it a larger number.  I also find it very annoying that when I am stuck and unable to clear any of the current quests, no more are made available.  In one of my other games, quests are added regularly, allowing me to go to something new and come back to the older quests.  This would help eliminate the frustration of trying the same game over and over again.  As I have a limited income, I am not free to spend money on crystals which makes it extremely difficult to make any progress.  I will continue playing as I do enjoy the game and the challenges, but I don't know how much longer, due to the high frustration level"

I wish we could give negative stars. Frustrating frustrating frustrating, did I mention frustrating, zero customer service.Pros:Could be fun if it worked right and you got your money 's worthCons:1. The game never works right. Also if you think you are playing for free, forget about it, this game is not fun at all unless you spend money, otherwise you are constantly losing battles. Been there tried that, not fun at all.2. 80% of the time you don't get what you paid for. Example, you buy a pack that is $99 and comes with few different types of of upgrade, lets call them A, B and C. So you paid $99 to get upgrade A, upgrade B, Upgrade C. Fantastic you are all happy now to use the upgrade and make your moves, 1 problem, for some reason when you go to apply upgrade C, you get an error. Ok contact customer service right? Read #33. Contacting customer service = you send an email for help, you immediately get a programed response saying their team is viewing your claim, then you wait 24 to 48 hours for response. When they do respond it is always the same:A. If your issues is the game giving you an error or something not working right, then you are told ""programmers are aware and are working on it. (sure, I have been waiting for over a year for the programmers to fix my errors and nothing, meanwhile they have my money for the issue that is not working)B. If your issue is you didn't get the correct amount of something then they will keep incorrectly telling you that you are the one that is mistaken and you did get the correct amount,  even tho after the first 3 times you have learned your lesson and this time you have screen shots as proof.(see my first picture about credits, at the bottom you see link for 6 screnshots as proof, still didn't get my 3 million  credits till this day, now it is obsolete)4. One email per day. After waiting 24 to 48 hours (mostly 48 or longer) you get a response back from  customer service if you are lucky, and you respond, you now have to wait 24 hours for a response, in short your communication is limited to one email per day making every issue a week long project.5. Don't expect them to read your emails, example last week I like an idiot decided to come back to this game, paid for upgrade pack, part of it was something called ""instant multiple research"". What this does is allows you to upgrade bunch of categories with one click instead of literally 100s of clicks. Emailed customer service complaining about ""instant multiple research"" not working, 2 days later got a response saying we understand you have an issue with ""alliance gifts"" we are working on it. Now ""alliance gifts"" have nothing to do with ""instant multiple research"" so obviously they didn't read my email at all.That is like you call AT&T to complain about your ""cellphone service"" and they say: we understand you are having an issue with your"" tivo box"" and we are working on it.That was last week, replied to them saying their response had nothing to do with my issue, you want to know what their response is?I will let you know when they respond because 7 days and 5 emails later, I have 0 response to report to you. This is Machine Zone's idea of customer service.6. No way to contact this company other than the process above, which basically means no way of contacting this company. Mobile Strike, gods of War and a couple of other games are owned by machine zone.STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME / COMPANY, THEIR FINE PRINT SAYS YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS AND THEY ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO HAVE THE GAME WORKING PROPERLY OR OWE YOU ANYTHING AT ALL WHETHER ITS THE GAME WORKING  CORRECTLY, YOU GETTING WHAT YOU PAID FOR IN-APP PURCHASES.

Only two complaints: sometimes when trying to find a required item you can complete the level it's supposed to be on a dozen times in a row and still not find it, which moves the game from challenging and fun to frustrating and no fun. Also, I hate hate hate faded mode, where the colors are faded from the pieces. My eyes aren't as good as they used to be and it's really hard to differentiate the pieces by shape alone.Otherwise, a really fun game."

It always has the loading circle spinning and nothing happens. Not sure if you can save your data and reload game on new device. Most other facebook connected games let you do this automatically. I already had to start over once because of tablet death. I probably would spend some money on this game if transferable data to a new device was an option. But as of now it's pointless to buy upgrades if you can't save gameplay.  Other issues were constant freezing.

I liked some of the other games by Phyton,  The problem I have with this game, is it's slow to respond to taps, too much lag time after you tap. Then you tap again, and you miss things and the next job has popped up,,it gets frustrating, because it doesn't allow me to look things over to see what objects do, or to get info.. I'll give it a little more time, it might improve as I go, as it could just be I'm doing something wrong."

security,Some annoying issues,"Some annoying issues. Here are some bad things about this game:1.  The amount of energy to play the puzzles is too high.  I can go thru 100 energy in less than 30 min. easily.  Then wait for hours for it to build up again only to play 3 or 4 puzzles before it runs out again. COME ON MAN!2.  Why is it SOOOO SOOOO hard for the appropriate items or chargers needed for quests to drop?  Example, During the Chocolate Day Event, after spending over 500 energy (over  2 days worth of playing) I only had 1 recipe finished.  COME ON MAN!3. Having played the game for almost a month and getting over 525 collection items and over 200 chargers (yes I counted them all), I only have 19 collections finished.  That's not even 20.  I've wasted a whole lot of TIME and ENERGY only receive items and some chargers that I DO NOT need.  COME ON MAN!I don't know if y'all designed the game this way, but it needs to change.Here are some suggestions:1.  Reduce the energy cost on the puzzles or increase energy regeneration so that players can play for a little bit longer.2. Please make it easier for quest items and chargers to drop.  Those Magic and Lucky Charm spells (at least for me) didn't help me at all.3. The events have to last a little bit longer.  There needs to be a better chance of getting the reward.4. Increase the time on some of these timed puzzles.  Some of these puzzles are very difficult, having to do them in under a minute and a half is just insane.I like this style of match-3, clear the tiles type of play.  It's a challenging game, that is why I give it this rating."

My biggest complaint is you'll play a level to complete a task and you won't find the item you need. If you play this game just be aware that you'll play the same level over and over and over and over and over again. And it's obnoxious especially because they only give you extremely limited energy to play the levels in the first place. It's annoying enough that I'm considering maybe deleting the game.

Not a bad match three game upfront, but the game becomes increasingly unfriendly as you progress.  As you build the different parts of the town (farm, pottery, etc.), you can't upgrade them until you reach a certain level.  So now I have completed all the available boards - Hut, Farm, Sepat and Pottery, and am halfway through level 18.  I can't level up until I reach level 20 for Pottery, 22 for Hut, 25 for Sepat and 26 for Farm.My only choices for progress are to replay completed levels for days or (I assume) spend jewels.  Add me to the list of customers who would much rather pay an upfront fee, or a purchase fee once I learn the game, rather than have companies try to nickel and dime me.FACE IT, DEVELOPERS!  I have numerous options to play other games and will continue to delete these types of stacked games and move on to something new.  The only way you will get any money from me is to change the way you bill for playing.  A one time fee is the only way you will ever see my money.People, if you want a fun Match 3 game that can be played indefinitely without spending a dime, get Gummy Drop.  It can be done!"

Like I said,  I play daily. No reason for that. Additionally, the ""add friends"" feature doesn't work. With other games, you can trade items with friends to complete collections, give gifts, etc. The same features is said to be available in this game but it's inconveniently unavailable so you will be incented to purchase items instead of earning them fairly through play.  Since I've stuck around so long, clearly I'm a little addicted, but it's time to delete this app."

If you don't close it, the same message will keep popping up, therefore FORCING you to close it. If you have an older version of Skype, keep it.

I am really peeved that the Skype download for Kindle Fire HD 8.9 does not allow for you to add the area/local code, so that you can obtain a number for your device on the local network.  This renders video chatting with other friends on Skype useless, since they have no contact number with which to reach you.  I tried to delete it twice and reload the application, and even tried the android application.  Nothing I did corrected the problem.  If you don't put the area code in and just have the state, like Texas, it gives you a phone area code for San Antonio, which is 5 hours away.  Someone needs to seriously look at this and make a correction to the app., or give us a way to fix it.  Skype is one of the main video chatting apps that most people use.  Had I known it was useless I would have spent my money on the Ipad, but i figured all i needed was to video chat and didn't need to have a camera on the back for vidoes and pictures that the Ipad includes.  At least Ipad can use SKYPE!  I'd give this app a zero if it allowed...."

self direction,Needs improvement on all platforms,"Needs improvement on all platforms. Let me start by saying that I have the iOS version, which is installed on both my iPhone and iPad.  It was as five-star app for a while, until iOS 7 was released.  I think they released one update that made it compatible with 7, but it came with an annoying bug - it makes you log in EVERY SINGLE TIME you want to access your recipe box, even though I had the ""keep me logged in"" thing checked off.  Very annoying.  I let the app developers know about this, they say they are aware of it, and it will be fixed in the next update.  This was months ago, I am still waiting for that update.When I saw that the Kindle Fire version was free (I paid $1.99 for the iOS version), I decided to give it a try and see if I can use it and avoid the log in issue.  That part worked.  What DOESN'T work is inside the recipe box itself.  When I tap on one recipe, it takes me to a completely different recipe.  It's not like I tapped the one next to it by mistake; it takes me to recipes that aren't even next to the one I tapped on.  This makes the whole recipe box feature almost useless; what is the point of having it if you can't quickly access the exact recipe you want?  Apps like this are supposed to make life easier, but this one in any form is more hassle than it is worth.  Maybe I'll try it again, if they EVER update it.  I'm not holding my breath waiting for that, though.  It's actually easier now to just go to foodnetwork.com on my device, log in there, and access my recipe box that way."

I'm not going to go over them as that's pointless; you can read the description of product or look at other reviews.I'm using a Samsung 8 inch tablet so for some reason when in landscape(horizontal) mode, the view is zoomed in too much so I often have to scroll down a little bit to see text at the bottom of my lecture notes. I cant zoom out so that the entire slide fits the height of my screen.  This is not a problem when in vertical mode though, everything is smaller (as expected), but that's why I prefer to edit in landscape mode. When switching from horizontal to vertical mode (vice versa) it teleports your view to somewhere else on the slide and zooms in...this is really annoying especially when annotating/editing.While free hand draw is amazing for writing out text with a stylus, however, the most important feature: typed text option(they call it freetext) does not even come close. The font color default is white...annoying when your first typing out text. The textbox that forms around the typed text is too big, I hate having to resize it to size of text, should make it automatic like in Adobe PDF. The fill in background color option for the textbox is extremely buggy especially when viewing in edit mode. The color wheel is weird and doesn't properly show no color option. There are no options to change type of font, font size, or highlight/underline (etc) the text you've typed out.There's no ""save as"" option though there is a backup option before each initial edit. The only way to save your file is when you exit the pdf.I can't tap to turn the page, only swiping can do that right now. They should add in the option of ""viewing mode"" aka full screen mode or maybe just have an area of the screen where I can just tap to turn page instead of bringing up the annoying edit UI.Any edit you make on this app does not do well with other pdf apps such as Adobe PDf app as mentioned by another reviewer. The edits are not visible on Adobe PDF. Not sure if the edits are shown on the computer.They should add more options so I can customize it to my liking.I think I'll stick with the native Adobe PDF app to annotate my lecture notes for now because it's simple and reliable."

security,I couldn't get it to work,"I am a music teacher and I am trying to move all of the written homework from paper to ""on-line"". I read the reviews and PDF Max seemed to be the highest rated PDF annotater for Android.  I tried the free version and I thought that I loved it - lots of bells and whistles.....so I bought it.A few students agreed to do this trial with me so they sent me their homework in PDF format.  I graded it....and then I tried to send it back by email.They could open it but they couldn't see the corrections.  Not on Adobe Reader, or Notability, or any other PDF reader....except the one student who also got PDF Max. HmmmmmmmI contacted the company last Tuesday morning to ask what I was doing wrong.  It is now Monday...no reply.I am sure that there is a way to get it to work, but, with customer service like this, I am not interested in trying.  I have since discovered that I can do EXACTLY what I need to do with FREE Adobe Reader, so I have uninstalled PDF Max.  I hope that you have better luck with it.Update.  It is now December 3, 2015.  Still no reply from the company.  I am now using Foxit.  Free, easy works great!Update #2. It is now January2, 2016.  Still no reply from the company.  By using Foxit, I realized what I was doing wrong and went back to PDF Max Pro to find the ""flatten"" feature. Will update when I have more info....Update #3  It is now January 8, 2016. Still no reply from the company.  What I thought was a problem fixed, turned out to be a bigger problem.  I contacted the company again on January 3. No reply. The ""flatten"" feature is really strange.  It saves a separate copy of the document rather than flattening the current document.  Tried to find the saved ""flattened"" document and it was nowhere to be found.  I have gone back to Foxit.  Foxit works OK and serves the purpose (and it is free).  I really wish Mobeera would reply and help me with the ""flattening"" issue because (other than that) I really like the features on PDF Max Pro..."

You'd think that with a demise of cable industry they would have learned their lesson.Second, their concept of ""DVR"" is laughable. With all the past shows stored on their servers (in the ""cloud"") - why is it that I need to actually mark future shows to record? Why can't I just go and watch any past episode that I missed?

This rule only applies to TV Devices.  So in that case she or I would need to stop using the firestick to watch fubo and start watching on our phones or laptops.  Extremely inconvenient for people using the same account in 2 different homes.  I spoke to fubo about it and they said there's nothing they can do and it's part of their contract.They need to make it so that we can pay maybe like $5 extra per month to add a TV Device outside of the home network cuz this is going to make me cancel their service."

security,Not worth the effort,"Not worth the effort. Olympic coverage is constantly buffering, even during the commercials. And when content is playing, half the time the screen is so blurry it's practically unwatchable. All of these problems occur even though I have average speeds of ~150Mbps, so the bandwidth problem is on NBC's end. Additionally, the app interface is repetitive and difficult to navigate to the content I want to actually see."

The app will randomly crash on occasion (at the worst moments!! And then you have to start the video all over again) and is pixelated (not an internet issue, all other apps/streaming work fine). Very frustrating."

I'm trying to watch a nationally televised game, but my local NBC channel is showing a local game instead. Skip the app and use the browser, but only if you must. If you can watch the event on ANY other platform than NBC, use that instead."

self direction,Can't use this app without a cable or satellite TV subscription,"Can't use this app without a cable or satellite TV subscription.

self direction,App limits time.,App limits time.. So without a Cable subscription you are limited to 44 minutes of watching football so while they say you can watch the game they don't tell you that you get a tease and then you have to sign in.But you don't find this out until you download the app and start watching. So unless you have 7 devices to watch online you will never see a whole game.

The Fire TV Stick is basically just Android, so the app that is on the FireTV is the exact same app you would have on your phone, minus some features.I don't know if it's a limitation of the FireTV Stick or what, but the video skips like crazy, it's poor quality. On my phone it looks amazing. I'm guessing this issue a lot has to do with RAM or maybe CPU speed. Because the app on my tablet also has skippy video.The app needs better controls for using it on the TV."

security,The Fire Killer,I have been a User of tiny cam for a year now. I was very satisfied with the app and have it installed on my Droid X as well.  The issue started after the latest update to tiny cam.  The app will start to bring up mysecurity cam's and promptly lock up the fire. The kindle fire then must be hard reset by holding the power button in tell it shuts off.  I see other reviews with the same issue and it has been at enough time to pull the update and fix it. Come on people at least make the previous update available.
security,VLC is free so why use this?,"VLC can show my RTSP stream in real time perfectly.  I got this app on sale here and tried it on a Fire4K stick, and the video stream stalls and skips constantly, even on Hardware+ video settings (the only advice support could offer).  I know phone users love this app, but on Amazon Fire products it's useless thanks to the way Amazon developers dicked around with it's encoding (other streaming products have similar issues), so don't get it thru the Amazon store, only get it if you have a google play store on a real android device, not side loaded.  I'm 5 starring this 3 star app so Amazon won't censor my post here."

self direction,When iPhone app connects strange messages appear,Initially connecting an iPhone using the Screen Mirroring companion App to the Fire Stick Screen Mirroring App the connection works but after a couple of minutes a message appears on the TV that there is an error described as unauthorized use. You can't get rid of that message even when you exit the Fire Stick App. The only way to get rid of the message is to actually reboot the Fire Stick. Although there is nu charge for the Screen Mirroring Fire Stick App I had to pay for the companion iPhone version which turned out to be two different applications from that company. So I have invested money in something that DOES NOT WORK. The company's answer was I had to wait for a new update in their application. They should have refunded my money for the iPhone apps.

It does not work. It crashes after less than 1 minute saying it is unable to communicate with the camera. I have tried playing with all settings but no change. I made sure that the MIPC app was not running on the other phone, going so far as to turn off that phone, so there would be no interference.tinyCam PRO, in its current form (Dec 15, 2020) is a fundamentally unreliable product. It may have worked in some previous versions with some older ip cameras, but the current version does not work with current hardware. Don't waste your time or money."
security,Does not work on new kindle fire.,"We had an original kindle fire. this app worked pretty well for awhile on there. then we had to replace due to a sound issue. Aged we got the new fire the app would lock the device up and we would have to do a hard shutdown. it never worked after that and we had multiple new devices sent to us. support from the app just said ""do not run on other devices"". I have no idea what that means since this is an amazon approved app.  all subsequent attempts at support have gone unanswered.  Also the app people are constantly hitting you up for donations."

I was able to get it by using a USB mouse plugged into the OG Fire TV, but the stick does not have USB, so I am unable to edit that one.Also, the app is crashing randomly now on both devices (may be due to a recent update)."
security,Update problem,"I'm having problem with updates stuck in ""Install Pending"". Does anyone know why or know how to resolve this problem?"
self direction,no easy to select the share or delete icon at all,"FireTV:  When viewing a recorded video, button selections on the screen don't highlight when selecting them (play/pause/forward/delete/etc.), so you can't tell what you are doing.  Also, no easy to select the share or delete icon at all.  If you keep trying, the app locks up."
self direction,Voyeur cam should be the name.,"On first use it populates the screens with 16 random public webcams most are of little use and very little of interest.  Many of them result in ""Video failed"".

I just want to view one or two of my home webcams nothing more.Definitely not PRO, Amateur is a more apt description."
stimulation,NOT Dependable,"I got this app to use with my Fire TVs and at first it worked great.  However, I have since wasted many hours setting this up with the 16 D-linksecurity cameras I have, only to see the app suddenly quit working and have to go through the whole process again.  I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app, fiddled with all the complicated settings, and am just tired of dealing with it now.  II am pretty tech savy but the aggravation just isn't worth it and I do NOT recommend this"
security,"Works good, but it has a problem","I have 5security cameras in a closed network being displayed. There is no internet access. The software is powerful, but easy to setup at the same time. The problem that I'm having is that it will only work for about 15 to 20 minutes, then the software blows up. If I provide internet access, it works perfect. The developer has not responded to my email.  I'm still looking to a solution."
self direction,"Won't Connect... no ""generic"" camera setting","I bought this camera [...]. Based on the reviews, different brands/models are shipped to different people, and the one I got has absolutely no brand or model markings anywhere on the camera, included CD (and software on CD), or box. No instructions either. Using the Android app, IP Cam Viewer (a competitor for tinyCam Monitor), the camera brand and model came up automatically as ""Unknown Brand"", ""IPCAM1,IPCAM2"". Everything works perfectly in that app, connected on first try and hasn't had any problems since. I bought tinyCam Monitor Pro, since there was no way to actually try it out (the ""test drive"" amazon thing isn't going to work for actually seeing if the app will connect to a networked camera.... or at least, it wouldn't connect to mine), and I wanted to use the additional motion detection and recording features not found in IP Cam Viewer. However, I can't connect to the camera, I'm assuming since there is no comparable setting to the ""Unknown Brand"" option in IP Cam Viewer, and the app doesn't know how to communicate with it. Everything else is set the same as it is in IP Cam Viewer... same address, port, etc. I've tried all the camera brands/models that I've seen mentioned in the reviews for my camera, but I keep getting ""Video Failed (socket closed)"" and ""Video Failed (404 - not found)"" errors. So weak."
stimulation,Unreliable and irritating,"Don't buy this app.I wasted $4. App crashes on Fire TV stick, shuts itself off going back to home screen of Fire TV. I bought it to be able to watch kids sleep while working on a computer in the other room.

self direction,Very difficult to set up,"First off, the motion alerts do not work unless the app is running in the background.  If the app is running, you can set it up to record automatically, but leaving it on will be at the expense of ram and battery life.I spent hours trying to get the app to work outside my home WIFI.  I figured out how to set the IP address on my camera so it is not dynamic, then figured out how to use port forwarding on my router, and had to set up a temporary DDNS address for my public IP just to make that happen.  It worked for two days, then a two second power outage reset something and I can't pull up feed on my phone anymore.  I dont feel like figuring it out at this point.The camera I'm using is a Foscam F19893P V2, for reference.The customer service is non existent.  I emailed them several times.  They only responded when I asked for a refund just to tell me I would not get one.The free foscam app that it came with works fine inside and outside my WIFI as long as my home internet is running and my phone has bars.  I wanted a a way to automatically record on motion, so I downloaded ISpy on my laptop for that.  It's a free open-source program.  Only issue is I have to leave my laptop on all the time until I come up with another solution."

I love that they support the Eufy PTZ camera which I purchased this year (2020) but I took 1 star away because you can't get audio as of yet. I took another star away because you can't pan & tilt through this app. I turned on the motion detection and I love that it zooms in and alert you in the app if there is motion, but the default settings are too sensitive because it goes off when there is no one in the room. I wish if it had the option to use the Eufy's person motion detection and sound AI crying notification. The camera also disconnects and reconnects often. Even though I mentioned many issues, it's still a good option to have at your disposal. I like that Eufy is listed so you can login rather using the RSTP method."

self direction,💥💥Don't get this game💥💥,"💥💥Don't get this game💥💥. Graphics and challenges are really good. The game is really complicated and not for younger kids at all. There is a very difficult technique to mastering the game as you rely on buildings, gear and mods that are all based on percentages and numbers. If you join a good alliance, you will learn easily what to do and start rally wars together which is a blast. My biggest complaint however and why I gave it 1 star is this. They claim in all their adds that the game is free. Which could be true except it would take you several years to build your base and gear to even remotely be able to compete in the game. Also, there are a lot of things, including gear that you absolutely can not get without spending money. If you do not spend money then you will not enjoy this game. You can't compete and you spend your entire time farming tiles (which you get attacked on) and you still won't be able to gather enough rss to complete required research, build buildings and train troops.And let's not forget the packs they offer you to buy start at $9.99 just for gold (which gets you nothing) and up to $150 packs which get you a lot. However, the more you progress, it could take upwards of 16-20 packs to complete one research tree. That's $1600-2000 dollars using the average $99 packs they offer. Total rip off for digital info they upload after your purchase. ALSO, You purchase these expensive packs and you don't receive all the items, or they disappear from your inventory when your not looking.  I caution you to not get this game as it is addicting and you will rack up credit card bills before you know it. I know a lot of people that played this game that lost control and went into serious debt. RIP OFF"

hedonism,Some annoying issues,"Here are some bad things about this game:1.  The amount of energy to play the puzzles is too high.  I can go thru 100 energy in less than 30 min. easily.  Then wait for hours for it to build up again only to play 3 or 4 puzzles before it runs out again. COME ON MAN!2.  Why is it SOOOO SOOOO hard for the appropriate items or chargers needed for quests to drop?  Example, During the Chocolate Day Event, after spending over 500 energy (over  2 days worth of playing) I only had 1 recipe finished.  COME ON MAN!3. Having played the game for almost a month and getting over 525 collection items and over 200 chargers (yes I counted them all), I only have 19 collections finished.  That's not even 20.  I've wasted a whole lot of TIME and ENERGY only receive items and some chargers that I DO NOT need.  COME ON MAN!I don't know if y'all designed the game this way, but it needs to change.Here are some suggestions:1.  Reduce the energy cost on the puzzles or increase energy regeneration so that players can play for a little bit longer.2. Please make it easier for quest items and chargers to drop.  Those Magic and Lucky Charm spells (at least for me) didn't help me at all.3. The events have to last a little bit longer.  There needs to be a better chance of getting the reward.4. Increase the time on some of these timed puzzles.  Some of these puzzles are very difficult, having to do them in under a minute and a half is just insane.I like this style of match-3, clear the tiles type of play.  It's a challenging game, that is why I give it this rating."
hedonism,Frustrating instead of entertaining,"Have to play the same puzzles over and over again in search of items you never get to make collections.  Can quickly become a money pit of you allow it, so beware.  It becomes boring to listen to the same old music and do the same level and never complete collections and tasks.  Done with it."

hedonism,Two Stars,Game continually freezes
conformity,New update ruins the game. It sucks!,I just updated this game. It is a disaster. The game is visually messed up. It is flattened out and too big for a kindle screen . It does not allow you to reduce the size of the image on the screen . This really sucks.
conformity,One Star,"Not alot of fun, kind of boring"
conformity,Two Stars,want to remove from my list.
conformity,Hate the Way You Cannot Move at Times,"Too often, I waste time trying to make my next move.  This is especially ridiculous on timed games.  First, I have to wait to move, and that includes even when I attempt your selection.  Then, when I can finally select a square, the game moves it where it wants, not allowing me to make a move.  You can make suggestions, but they shouldn't keep me from moving and you should NEVER, EVER override my  choices!  This has stopped me from progressing as I see no way to handle timed mode as you  control the board.  I am playing the Kindle version.  Other version s may be more honest."

hedonism,Two Stars,constant interuptions from sponsers
hedonism,Fun but frustrating,"Generally a fun game.  However, there is the level where the grass overtakes you at the same time you have to get rid of the totem pole.  This level is impossible to beat, and just makes me angry."

hedonism,Hmmm!,To many words and not enough play time and it made me lose my interest.
hedonism,frustrating  but extremely fun !!!!,"Each  level is fun  to play.  However, when trying to complete  collections can be frustrating --- especially when  you're not sure how many times you are going to have to go through a section."

conformity,One Star,"DidnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like it, couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand what was to be done"
hedonism,Interesting Butâ€¦,While the game can be interesting at times the most frustrating thing is how slow the progress in leveling up. Although I enjoy most puzzles I have a love hate relationship with night mode. I can not stand the spotlight you have to move around. I don't like how complicated and the number of moves it takes with the ropes etc. Time and Blitz Time puzzles need to be improved. Overall it remains an enjoyable play experience.
hedonism,One Star,Didn't like at all.
conformity,not for me,not enough game too much stuff

hedonism,Two Stars,Boring!
conformity,Not what I expected.,I didn't really like it as much as I would have like but someone else might feel differently
hedonism,Three Stars,kindda boring
conformity,Cradle,It is fun but I hate the waiting to recharge.
hedonism,Slightly frustrating,It takes too long to complete task on levels and you have to play the SAME game over again to get the target
hedonism,Too expensive & too slow,This game had potential but it takes too long to gather the required ingredients to complete the quests. You have to play a level multiple times before you get the item shown. I believe they want you to get so frustrated you will buy what you need.

achievement,Not for tablet,Doesn't work on Android tablet
benevolence,One Star,It never loaded onto my Kindle!

benevolence,Don't bother with it.,Was nothing like the advertisement of the game

hedonism,Can be a little mundane,I just found it kind of boring
conformity,Two Stars,It wasn't what I thought it would be.
conformity,Not my kind of game,Not my kind of a game
hedonism,I was disappointed,The game was fun until I wanted to use the 65+ gems that I had accumulated (in the piggy bank) and found out I'd have to PAY to use them. So I dumped the game. People should not have to pay to use what they earn for passing levels in game play. Not unless they want to buy extras or other items.
hedonism,Frustrating feature,Agree don't like playing the same level 3-4 times before actually collecting item.This is very frustrating
conformity,Hard to.understand,ery hard to figure out what to do next or how to progress to new levels. Still using trial and error to figure it out.

conformity,nothing,"I thought it would be fun to play this game, but couldn't figure out how & wish I hadn't bothered."
conformity,Confusing game,I have been trying to figure out this game for 2 days. I really don't think it's worth the effort.
hedonism,Settings,I absolutely love this game.  The only problem I have is having to log into FB  every time I open the game.  Now it was me stuck on a screen and will not pay me log in
conformity,Confusing,"This is the only game that I can't quit playing, although I KNOW I'm not gonna win.  I only get to play about 4 times , then I run out of "" energy "" , then you have to pay real money for more energy, or wait a few hours until it renews by itsself.  There are no instructions, except match up the items.  What do I buy with the coins I win?  Everything requires the diamonds.  I really like the game, I just wish I knew how to play it, AND WIN, SOMETIME."
hedonism,Frustrated,"3 stars for creatvity .  But I am constantly frustrated because when I'm  trying to finish a collection and tap on a charger to do it, I often get sent to a game level where the icon flashes. If  I successfully complete it, I rarely win the icon I want.  Instead, Empire gives me a prize I already have. Sometimes. 10 or 15 of them.  Often just close game in frustration."
hedonism,Get ready for question after questions,To many pop ups
conformity,Not for me,Too complicated for me. Do this get that go here ... stick with mahjong
hedonism,Average,Long press for every selection is terrible. Same music track over and over. Plenty of timers and hurdles that you cannot continuously play without opening your wallet.

achievement,One Star,It does not work on my kindle for some reason
hedonism,Must make purchases to continue,The matching puzzles are fun and challenging but you will soon hit a road block unless you buy items to complete collections. That is frustrating.
conformity,Hated the fight,It kept kicking me off so I  uinstalled it
conformity,Same as every other game. Didn't thrill me!,No thrilled by an means. Same as any other game nothing different or exciting.
hedonism,RIDICULOUS!!!!,"So disappointed. I was so far into the earlier version. Just lately I'd get app errors, and messages telling me to re-install the game. I finally gave in because I was so tired of my game being interrupted by these messages. We'll guess what! My original game is lost! I have to start all over! NOT HAPPY!!  Oh, and the other guys a re right, there are too many in app purchases and it takes way too long to get to the next levels, acquire coins, and find items!!!!! Such a scrappy deal!"
conformity,Not what I wanted.,Wasn't what I thought it was. Didn't match the description that was shown.
benevolence,Not satisfactory,It is not as advertised
conformity,Unplayable,The game was  full of glitches from the beginning. Couldn't play it.
hedonism,Stingy and frustrating,Required items are hard to collect. Game designed to make you spend money to obtain supplies. Lives are lost upon completion of level whether or not you complete it successfully.  You should be able keep life if you beat the level.
hedonism,Poor performance,Kept freezing up.  Couldn't even get past opening screens.
hedonism,Not very exciting,It was a bit boring. Not a lot of real excitement to it. Sorry
conformity,Three Stars,Hate that you have to pay to keep playing

conformity,Just a game,Second time for this game.Had to reset my Kindle. Like the game  Some levels I have had to buy stuff to beat them. But can't always play for free
hedonism,Won't respond,I would have liked this game if it would actually respond to my touch. I have to tap the screen dozens of times for a response. Removing from my cloud now.
conformity,Confusing,Confusing.  Progression through the game is unclear.  I find myself jumping around. Is that the way it's supposed to be?
conformity,Don't like it.,Very confusing. Don't like it.
hedonism,Boring game,Didn't like the game...boring.
hedonism,Boring !,We don't really care for this kind of game. It a bit time consuming and boring although it may help stimulate decision making but who needs to think when we just want to be entertained.
conformity,Thought it was just going to be like a jewel blitz type game,"Thought it was just going to be like a jewel blitz type game.. I was bored with all the other side stuff, like build a village, go back to the shop, buy a hoe for the garden, etc.  No sooner had I downloaded (thinking it was something else) I un-installed it.  Just not for me."
hedonism,"Fun, frustating, addictive",Fun but frustratingThe delay between ordering crystals and delivery really slows thing down...but worth the aggravation.
conformity,one Star,Download is free but nothing else is. You can't play the game without paying.
hedonism,Not happy,"I've playing this game for over a month. I've purchased many gems, time and other items. The gems didn't come right away many times causing me to lose a level plus the energy to play that level. I contacted the developer with little success. I enjoy the game! But I'm deleting it did to these issues. It's not fun losing the money and it's been a lot of money!"
hedonism,Disappointed,"You play and play ,get pissed off cause game just shuts off on its own"
conformity,Confusing,The game is fun but very confusing . You do not have any info how to get more jewels or anything.
benevolence,Waste of time,This game is not at all what they show.
conformity,"CONFUSING - and difficult to figure out the ""next step""","I've played about 10 to 12 ""games"" and still confused about what to do to go to the next level.This kinda has a witchy magic feel with an evil element that I don't care for from the ""bad guy"" that we are attempting to defeat.  I'll likely not keep it.  I do not allow any witch craft in my home."
hedonism,Frustrating,There seems to be no logic to how this game operates. Play endlessly to collect a charge and you are rewarded with everything but what you seek. Waste of time.
hedonism,One Star,Game id fun for a little while. After  that it becomes repetitive and boring.
hedonism,Totally addictive and completely frustrating!,"I have also been playing for over a year and I get so mad that you have to go through a level a million times before getting the items to complete collections. Somehow I still love the game. I think I persist because I just won't let it beat me and I really curious to see what's coming up next. Please, please fix this issue before it becomes a lost cause."
conformity,not advancing,"Been playing for weeks and haven't gotten a single item I need, makes me want to quit playing."
conformity,One Star,"I would put no star's, if I was allowed. It would not load into my kindle HD."
hedonism,Boring Game,Didn't like this game at all.  Deleted it almost immediately.
hedonism,Two Stars,Deleted it within a few days was too slow of a pace....
conformity,Just not my kind of game,Just not my kind of game
conformity,too complicated,too complicated
hedonism,Boring!  No clear exit from the game.,Boring!  No clear exit from the game.
hedonism,Kinda boring,This game is boring.  Also on level one I have 24 out of 24 and yet I can't get to level  two.Poor programming.
hedonism,Short lives,Your only given so many lightening lives and it makes the game short lived.  Not enough rewards.  DefinitelyNo way to make jewels short of buying them.  Disappointing game
conformity,did not like,not my kind of game at all
hedonism,Boring game,"Very boring game - the levels are mostly the same thing over and over.  It takes forever to get enough points to go up a level.  And you have a seemingly endless list of goals and even when you reach a goal nothing special - you just get more goals.  FYI - these ""free"" games either cost you a fortune with in app purchases so you can play faster or if you choose to play without boosts take forever."
conformity,Bad,It kept kicking me out don't download it
hedonism,Frustrating,Progress is slower and s!ower as you level up
hedonism,Annoying,"I couldn't uninstall fast enough.  The artwork - though decent - makes the actual game-play tiny and challenging to see.  Also, you can't skip dialogue/story, which pops up before every ""challenge"".  Nor can you skip demonstrations for EASY/OBVIOUS levels.  Not at all what I expected or hoped for, based on the preview.  Too bad, because I thought it had potential for a ""brain exercise break"" game, but it was a huge disappointment and waste of a download -- even though it's free."
benevolence,One Star,uninstalled
conformity,"Fun, but","This game is fun, but since I refuse to spend money it is slow going."
hedonism,Will not open,Application will not open after update was installed.
hedonism,Not for me,I have already uninstalled. Do not like games that mimic the occult. Example: spells
conformity,One Star,too much work to figure out how to play
hedonism,Sounds are irritating,"They keep adding the most annoying sounds and there is no in-app sound control to turn it down, just off for this game. I used to enjoy playing, but can hardly stand the noise now!"
hedonism,Failure,Not fun
conformity,Challenging,Doesn't always tell you how to use things and how to win the challenge.
hedonism,Doesn't work,"Showed a gear icon that appeared to be settings that would allow turning off or at least lowering the volume on the nauseating music, but seemed to be locked into a tutorial mode because nothing happened when the icon was clicked. After several minutes of frustration trying to get it to work, I uninstalled."
hedonism,Two Stars,I didn't really care for it. It was too repetitive and complicated at the same time.
conformity,Dissapointed,The ad that I responded to showed different game play...I wish what was advertised matched what I gotâ€¦
hedonism,Interesting but frustrating,"he story and different tasks are interesting, but it can be very frustrating. Clearing all the tiles in a level is a nice challenge, but trying to figure out why you can clear all the tiles, but still not pass a level is maddening.Retaking the level, may or may not make it clear what else can be done to improve your score.I wish it were possible to purchase the game outright, as opposed to ""buying crystals"" to complete challenges."
conformity,Not happy.,"Your algorithms suck.  1 move left and you make me ""buy"" more moves. I'm close to deleting this one."
conformity,disappointing,"The game was really fun in the beginning, but now I have played levels over fifty times and never got the one piece I needed. I too am ready to delete the game because it isn't fun any more.Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¢"
hedonism,Am I doing something wrong?,"SO SLOW...I tried deleting & reinstalling. Graphics & story line enticed me, but it is too slow to respond."
conformity,"Fun, butâ€¦","I like the game but don't like being ""punished"" for not dragging it out! Every time I try to go on u mess me up by ruining my plays!!"
hedonism,slow to much story,to much back and forth story line really would like to just play the game without all the story
conformity,Update issues,Enjoy this game but now will not load after latest update. Disappointed
hedonism,Slowwwww progress through the game,The game is too slow moving. I like to work toward goals but this is too frustrating.  You can only play about 6 times (win or lose) before lives are gone.  I can't seem to play for long before I have to leave it and wait to play again.
hedonism,Frustrating.,Too often the game will not allow you to win.
hedonism,Enjoyable but Frustrating,"I really like this match 3 game, but I find it frustrating in that you just get to playing and you run out of energy to proceed forward unless you either wait until time fills up the energy meter or you give up and buy, with your money, more resources with which to continue the game! The puzzles are fun and evolve in complexity and new challenges as the game progresses. It is a well constructed game."
hedonism,Keeps showing up . I uninstalled,"No matter how many times I uninstall from the device and the cloud , it comes back on my device.  At least a dozen times."
hedonism,Too many things to unlock,"There are too many things that you have to unlock. I did give it 3 stars, because many of the things can be unlocked by watching a short advertisement. It gets annoying after awhile though, especially if you have younger children that don't understand how to unlock and keep pushing the video ads to go to the page."

hedonism,One Star,too much work to figure out how to play
hedonism,irritating pop-up,"I do not have Cradle of Empires on my Kindle, nor do I want to install it. I absolutely HATE its annoying pop-ups everytime I click on 'Start a new game' from my Solitaire app. Sometimes it takes 15-20 taps to get rid of it....just for that reason I'd never install it!"

hedonism,An error message shows up all the time,"I love the app, I love the stories, everything. But there's one thing that I hate, whenever I go to open the app, an error message shows up. And it won't allow me to read the stories or anything. But yet I don't want to delete the app because I'm afraid I will lose all of my progress. I don't know if this is happening to anyone else."
achievement,Don t bother,Just wanted to see what it was.  Really kind of childish.  Not for me.  I uninstalled it
conformity,Love it but....,I'd give it a 5 star but since an update it's not letting me continue any story.
hedonism,Not for me,"I don't like the games that keep you involved in a ""story"" and this does just that. If you are young and like this type of thing you'll probably like it. If you are a mature person, probably not."

conformity,glitch,I've downloaded and un installed  this game. My avatars are always naked. I don't know why.

hedonism,Can't enjoy the game u less you spend lots of money,Can't enjoy the game u less you spend lots of money. This game is made so that you have to buy packs in order to be a contender and enjoy playing the game otherwise you will lose due to having weak power.
conformity,One Star,The game is always stalling and shuts down.
conformity,Ridiculous,Items obsolete in days and way too expensive.  Game glitches constantly and I get booted all the time.  Game monitors state chat and deletes my messages.  No customer service. Complete waste of my hard earned money.
conformity,No don't get,Sucks don't get because it's laggy and ads and all that so DONT GET IT PPL
hedonism,Complete lack of enjoyment,"this review. Having read multiple reviews from other players I know that my experience is not unique but very common. Each state is governed by the players that cheat the most and spend the most money. The only way to succeed is to spend more money than the other players, or hack the game for items that would cost money. The culminating purpose of the game is to have each state work together to beat out other states in point challenges. However the petty power bullies refuse to allow any smaller players the opportunity to fully engage in the challenges by utterly destroying their base. Wish I never downloaded it. Glad I never spent money on it. Oh, yeah! The big power players try to muscle and intimidate other players into spending money to pay them for protection, like the Mafia. And customer service actually ENDORSES THIS BEHAVIOR!"
conformity,Waste of time,Game just sucks
hedonism,"don't waste your time, its just a fancy comercial",Probably the most bring and slow game I've ever experienced.  Absolutely nothing to do except follow the script.  Not even any animation to watch the battles and raids that you wait so patently for...just a math calculation and a result.  Yawn.
conformity,One Star,Sucked

hedonism,Irritating game play,"I just reinstalled this game to write this review and I will remove it when I finish.I got Mobil Strike as a easy enjoyable game which I appraoaced as a non cash player. So, I made lvl 14 and was going to keep playing but the game has become really unstable. It crashes after one or two actions. Can't find the app store or just goes away. Not relaxing, not for me any more....gone."
hedonism,"Pop ups, pop ups everywhere","Let's start with the beginning, so one goes to open the app (simple enough) and this part works you can get into the have you downloaded! YAYYY! but not  without twenty pop up adds saying ""commander a special sale is being held just for you"" or some other bogus line like that. And everything makes you pay actual money, in short  use your hard earned money somewhere else"

hedonism,"laggy, can't play",I usually don't give a 1 star rating but this game deserves it. It's next to impossible to play due to its incredible lag. Load times are horrible. Takes from between 3 and 25 seconds to load dialogue after you tap a command. I figured that I would play through the tutorial as it might have been a pregame only problem. It wasn't. Bad lag and load times carry over into the main game as well. Hopefully the developers will patch or update a fix. Until then I am not bothering with it.
conformity,Crashing Issues,I love this game but it is nearly unplayable as it crashed every max 5 minutes. I am using a 5th generation Kindle Fire. Any help would be appreciated.

hedonism,Boring oh no wait yep boring,Boring. No real strategy nor do you feel part of a battle. You just wait and wait and wait then spend money to wait less but you still wait
hedonism,all wasted time and money,"Greedy developers, not a free game, daily updates and constant glitches. Avoid completely. I played until earlier this year from the launch; all wasted time and money."

hedonism,Frustrating,This game is fun to play but the kindle version has way too many glitches. I just recently downloaded the update and now I can't even get it to load past 60% before it shuts down. Save yourself the frustration and get it on a platform that works (iPhone or Android).

hedonism,slow,It is so slow you can't do anything without it lagging
hedonism,Glitchy and expensive,Very glitchy game that requires alot of time AND money.  Nothing will pizz you off more than spending $400-500 on an electronic game just to have it crash constantly and lose items that you have spent time and money building.  Until they fix the glitches and bugs its not worth it.
hedonism,HORRIBLE SERVICE,This game has horrible glitches and developers will not fix it. They sell incomplete packages to steal your money.

hedonism,Fun game BUT....,its very glitchy.  It shuts down often and freezes up almost as much.  If you don't have money to throw away this isn't the game for you.  They introduce new troops and gear every week or so.  It takes a lot of money to keep up with the changes.  $100 or more at a time.

This App is unable to mirror what I am playing, so I cannot watch what I want on my Fire TV. That is sole purpose of the APP! If it fails in its one purpose it is useless and not worth the purchase."

benevolence,Quite useless. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t waste your money,Its quite useless. It is cumbersome to use as it imitates screen recording on phone to mirror your screen.

The link keeps getting lost especially when on the chrome browser.

I managed to connect to my Amazon Firestick on one occasion only and even then I could not get the sound to work properly.  I did not get it to connect after that.  I was able to get a refund for the App and I purchased a Lightning to HDMI cable which is more reliable albeit not as mobile."

hedonism,it is easy to use however it has a glitch it easily looses connection and has to be restarted,My problem with this device is it will loose the connection while viewing video's I have to reconnect the mirror app to the computer and restart the app. I have had on several occasions had to reconnect my computer to the app on the T.V. and to watch the video which I had to pause.

I tried all the pathways possible and could not get to the game to watch. We cannot get CBS locally because of a dispute Dish has with channel 5 and we have missed many programs already.  I was hoping to be able to use Prime to view CBS."

conformity,Undelivered promises,Tried to log onto a Saturday NFL game to no avail. Waste of time. The ad stated I could watch live streaming NFL games but they weren't carrying any 'non regional' games. Funny they never mentioned that in the ad.
conformity,Stupid subscription needed,Disappointed that Xfinity Triple Play includes damn near everything except CBS and Cinemax... The add on subscriptions make it worthwhile to switch to a streaming platform like sling.
benevolence,Works on cell phone not TV for free,They claim you can watch it live on TV but you can't actually watch it live on your TV without paying money but you can watch it live on your cell phone although the picture will be much smaller.
conformity,Disappointed,"The guide said that the football game I wanted to watch was going to be on at 10:00am.  When 10:00am rolled around, it was an infomercial instead.  The only reason I wanted CBS was to watch the football games but it won't let me.  Very dissatisfied"
benevolence,TOTAL FRAUD: I canceled the service twice and they kept charging it,"BEWARE of the scam: I went back to confirm it was not being billed after I cancelled it, and it was! I cancelled it again, and have screen shots of it no longer being on *auto-pay... yet they continue to charge for this.WHAT A FRAUD!!!"
conformity,Screencast Issues,"Had several issues when trying to screencast a video from my phone to the app on my Fire TV. It would crash within about 10 seconds of the video playing. Eventually I just gave up and searched for the video on the TV app and watched it from there which is why I give the stream quality a 1 star, the picture quality a 5 star, and the easy of use a 3 star."

Several more codes were issued and again the message stating it was an invalid code appeared.  I tried to log on from my phone, tablet and my desk top computer but could not get into the system to watch the game."
benevolence,Useless app,Downloaded this app so that we could watch the 2019 Pickleball US open championships in Naples which were supposed to be broadcasted on CBS Sports Friday night the app was useless it was like a news channel no menu no options absolutely usele
conformity,Frosted,I was after a NFL football game and was never able to receive it. I spent almost three hours trying to get a CBS station on my fire TV. DidnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work
conformity,I'm taking it off my dashboard,App is crazy difficult to use then when I finally found my game they wanted me to pay additionally for the game.Nonsense.  ESPN is easy and totally free!
conformity,Unsatisfied. Confused.,"I originally downloaded to watch an NFL game. CouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t watch it. CouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find it ? Confusing. It was on network television. CBS, channel 2."
conformity,Disappointed,"Well I have to say it was disappointing because I wanted to watch the Green Bay Game, it was unavailable in my area."
hedonism,horrible lagging and low res,this app is horrible low res and lags a lot.  I watched a game on the website on a browser with no problem so I know its not my internet and not headquarters messing up the signal.
achievement,Wasted $6,I ordered it to watch a football game because CBS and my cable provider are in a dispute and had to go to a different app to watch the game because when I tried to watch it on the CBS app they said my they couldn't air the broadcast because of the same dispute.  Wasted $6 and canceled it the next day.
conformity,Would not work at all for me,"I downloaded this app to watch the Super Bowl, but it would do nothing but sit there with a spinning circle in the middle of the screen. I finally switched and used the NFL app and it worked perfectly."

benevolence,Useless,"Bought this to try and get the Alabama/LSU football game since Dish lost our local CBS station. Try as we might, we could not get that game.  Useless."
benevolence,"Useless to me, Must have a ""TV Provider"" :(","I was hoping this was an internet streaming app that I could subscribe to monthly, and was disappointed to find you must have a TV Provider such as AT&T Uverse, DirecTV, Comcast etc. in order to use it.  No, I will not be signing up for a $100 dollar +  monthly bill in order to use this app!"
benevolence,Rip Off,"CBS requires you to pay for a subscription for their app, even though by law their content is supposed to be free to the public."
hedonism,"Glitchy, not worth your time.","Says no subscription and login required, then makes you login through your carrier. Glitchy and not worth the time."
achievement,False Advertising,"Very misleading name, you download thinking your going to be able to watch the game that's live on TV because the name of the app is CBS SPORTS STREAM & WATCH LIVE but you can't do either of those things, it's just game highlights, extremely disappointed and dissatisfied, false advertising."
hedonism,Slow,"Downloaded this app to watch the superbowl and I'm not sure if too many people were trying to use it or what, but the stream froze and attempted to load every 20 seconds or less.  I know it was not our internet connection due to our other streaming apps working just fine.  This app should not advertise Live TV if it cannot keep up with the demand, or at the very least give the viewer 5 minutes of uninterrupted watching time."
benevolence,Can't Access,"Logged in with my Direct TV account and it said ""Sorry, your TV provider is not yet supported in your location.""  I contacted them but no response."
hedonism,Get cable instead!!!,"Kept on losing the stream, had to restart several times."
achievement,Not for me,service provider needed to use. I've cut the cable and didn't work for me.
conformity,Did not work during the Super Bowl,We could not get the station to come in during the Super Bowl so we had to deal with sporadic reception via an antenna and a local affiliate.  We were disappointed.

hedonism,To many issues,Kept going out and/or freezing having to exit app and reload.
conformity,Not as expected,Did not keep it on....wanted the game and I got wasTalking.
conformity,Waste of time. Super lame,This is pointless. You canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t watch live events without paying for something free on television. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just a feed of the lame verision of ESPN but more off-putting
hedonism,Dumb,Cbs is the only network that charges to  stream content. We have cable so fox nbc and abc are free and can watch live tv Not sure how CBS us able to charge and anyones willing to pay. This channel is basically ESPN news  with the option to choose your highlights. Kinda dumb.

hedonism,Terrible App,It was very buggy and frustrating to use.
benevolence,No brackets? Pointless.,I love brackets. But I can't see them on the app and I can't force the browser to show me the desktop site -- it just keeps saying download the app. So this was pointless.
achievement,Horrible App,"The app sucks! Misleading, when I downloaded, I thought I would be able to watch something that was advertised. I thought I would be able to find it from the landing page, but couldn't find what was shown"

hedonism,Motion gets glitchy at times.,"Watched a MN Twins baseball game on Fox Sports North. Used my Amazon Firestick on my 1080p LG TV. At times, pitches, swings, and hard running players were a little blurry, and at one point the picture froze, and there was no audio.. Homing the Stick and restarting the app unfroze the stream, and the motion improved, but there was still an occasional hiccup. I usually have very smooth video streaming form my Firestick."
benevolence,Used to love this app. Now it's worthless.,"New update to both fox apps have caused the error ""no internet connection"".All other apps work.If I let it sit I can hear live streaming audio playing in the background.A reinstall did not fix the problem.A reset of the fire stick did not fix the problem"
hedonism,"Buggy, kept freezing and resetting to beginning during commercial breaks.","Attempted to use during 1 hour free trial, and found it virtually impossible to use. Didn't like us trying to fast forward and was unstable when we did. Every time we hit the first block of commercials, the app froze during one of the commercials (not the same one each time). Tried for 20 minutes to get past this roadblock (to see the start of the archived event we were trying to watch), finally just gave up. We were using a FireStick to stream on our TV. Problem wasn't internet connection (we tested the speed)."
hedonism,A huge frustration - avoid if possible,"Quite possibly the most frustrating app youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll ever use. You can contact the email in the app (settings - about - feedback) and get a generic response.  If you reply to the generic response after you have followed the instructions to no avail, you will not get a response. The authentication to you cable tv provider must not work for the app so it is basically worthless. It works fine on my iPad so Fox must have some issue with their Fire Stick ap"
hedonism,Does NOT work with Fire HD 10.,"After reading that FOX Sports NOW was compatible with my Kindle Fire HD 10. I couldn't get it to work.  After emailing FOX about the problem, they said it was not compatible. Frustrating but no $$$ lost as it was a free app."
hedonism,deceptive at best,"I thought I had read all the small print, so last week I started watching the Cal/Stanford Big Game.  In the middle of the second quarter the transmission stopped and a message popped up that I was finished with my free view and would have to pay to see the rest of the game.  NOT HAPPY"
benevolence,Fox sports app is useless.,"I went to watch the race on FS1 today. When I go to the Fox Sports app I've been using for months it takes me to a new app that I need to download, but there is no way to download the new app. This is useless, and NASCAR wonders why their viewers have declined. I know I won't be watching any sports on any Fox channel. I'm done with them."
benevolence,Utterly useless,I got the FOX sports app for my FireTV to watch NFL games.  Well you can't do that without a cable TV account.  If I had cable TV I wouldn't need to download the app for FireTV.  Two thumbs down for this waste of time.
conformity,Freezes A LOT,The app for Fox Sports was freezing a lot and would randomly kick me out of the app. It was easier to watch the games from a computer than it was the Firestick. Disappointing.
hedonism,Mr Freeze,"in general the prime stick works fine,but when i use fox sports go it is always freezing...very frutsrating and only reason i have not changed to solely steaming!!"
benevolence,Does not work,"Does not work, for me that is. I find most, if not all, Amazon TV programs are not accessible in my geographical region??So what is the use?"
conformity,Wasn't impressed,"Not what i was hoping for, more or less a sports update not a true streaming network for my home team. Probably will delete from smart tv and find something more in line of what i want."
hedonism,One Star,hate fox noise
benevolence,also worthless,"You can only watch NFL football on this if you already have cable or satellite TV. If you do, then what's the point of this application?"
benevolence,CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sign in,Useless
conformity,Waste my time.,Still need to type in the cable provider so doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t matter. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t waste time if you only have internet and not cable tv package.
conformity,Poor streaming quality,Was disappointed with the stream quality. Lots of buffering even over a super fast fiber optic internet connection. Bummer!
conformity,disappointed,i never got to watch any of the sports events i wanted to watch. had stereaming and prime issues that never got reolved.
conformity,Not as advertised,"This was supposed to be free and would access the Westminster Kennel Club dog show but every time I tried to see it, it said it wasn't supported through my provider.  Waste of time and big disappointment."
conformity,Not What I Was Hoping For,"I was hoping, against hope, that this app would allow me to watch NFL football games for the city I was born in and not the one I live in that was broadcast last Sunday on Fox.  No such luck!  Oh well!"
achievement,App Crash no support or help from Fox lost PPV,Purchased PPV. Main event froze three times. Contacted Fox they directed me to terms of agreement. In short they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help me and kept my money. No replay. I paid for an event I was not able to watch. No Guarantees in the fine print.
benevolence,Didn't work,"I downloaded the app, selected my provider, but every time I went to use it, I got a message that there had been some sort of difficulty and it couldn't start. Visiting the foxsports help website did not prove enlightening in the least."
benevolence,DoesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work here!,IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m currently in Mexico and 30 miles from San Diego and nothing works here due to licensing laws. What can I do?!
conformity,Did not work with my DirectTV Now,Unable to determine what level of programming package is required to get this service if you are using Basic DirectTV Satellite and the streaming app of DirectTV Now. A huge disappoint to find local sporting content.
conformity,Channel not working,I have not been able to use this channel.  I put the code in that was sent to me and could not go any further.  It didn't accept the code that was sent to me.
conformity,Disappointed,"Most all of this I needed a cable subscription, I wouldn't have gotten this if I had cable/"
hedonism,Frustrated,CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it to work.  It keeps wanting me to sign in thru the fire stick to my tv provider which is Amazon.  There is no Amazon listed in the selection on the fox sports  website.  Have never had this issue with any of the other fire stick apps.  Hmmm
benevolence,sucked,couldn't watch what I wanted to. if I want to watch old ball games I would record them. it said you could stream live but that wasn't true.
conformity,Disappointed,"We donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have cable or satellite tv, which is why we were trying to sign up for Fox Sports so we could watch our favorite football team play on Sunday. We made it until halftime, but it turns out this was a preview and we needed to log into our tv provider in order to watch the remainder of the game. If we had a tv provider we wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to sign up for Fox Sports."
conformity,"App is free, but you still have to have ...","App is free, but you still have to have a cable TV provider. The whole purpose of me getting app is because I don't want cable TV I prefer Streaming TV"

hedonism,"Picture/sound not in sync, hard to watch","I tried the app for catching a USWNT game I missed live.  It was easy to find the game on the app, but the picture froze/jumped through the entire match, and the sound was not in sync with the video.  I haven't had this issue on any other app, so I can't blame it on the connection."
conformity,Not what I expected.,I don't do football and hoped it might show horse racing.  I simply deleted it from the cloud.
benevolence,Never connected,Worthless unless you have a cable connection. DSL providers are either not listed or refuse service when you attempt to connect. Wasted two hours trying everything suggested to access.
conformity,Difficult to access.,We cannot Access it. Must it be run from a phone or laptop?
hedonism,Total Crap,"Same ""no internet connection issue"" as noted by others.  Please fix this!Is Amazon and Fox completely ignorant and stupid to ignore so many users!This app simply does not work on Firetv 4k and I am assuming all the other fire platforms.  This is crap, fix already!  Amazon are you listening?  Fox are you listening?  About ready to give up on all of it.  So frustrating."
conformity,Not able to stream,"Cant stream in the Bahamas - bummer, even though i pay for prime i still get an error about the region agreement"
conformity,Disappointed viewer,The app didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even work after i purchased the fight. Called in and was told they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t handle the ppv fight.
conformity,Not what I expected!!!!,"The streaming quality, the picture quality almost from the offset was not was I was expecting from Fox Sports. I was hoping to see a clear picture, instead I got the quality of an old analog tv. Had to switch immediately to my regular feed to watch the super bowl in HD. I hope there are no hidden automatic subscription attached to this offer."
conformity,Not what I expected,I didn't realize that the only way to use the app is to have a cable connection in order to view it.  I went to Amazon fire for the purpose of getting rid of cable.  This would also apply to any other apps such as Starz and HBO and others that you can't view unless you have a cable connection.
conformity,Illogical,The only way to use it was to have a cable tv subscription.  If I had that why would I need the app?  Illogical.

benevolence,Useless,DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have any blue jackets games it was a useless app I will be deleting Ã°Å¸â„¢â€ž
benevolence,Local Fox Sports station no longer available,Worthless since the latest update on the Fire Stick. What happened to the local Fox Sports channels? Used to be able to watch Cincinnati Reds games. I guess I'll be deleting this app. This needs to be fixed!
benevolence,Doesnâ€™t work,You have to have active subscription to one of the major cable companies other wise doesnâ€™t work
hedonism,stop working several times during the show,The channel stopped several times during the show.  Also kept reboothing.

hedonism,Frustratedâ€¦,"Quality was excellent in the iPad but was unable to stream- not able to log in on Amazon Prime. Also, unable to stream with Chromestick!"
conformity,I canâ€™t watch much,I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s because of my cable provider but I canâ€™t watch much. I try to put on the champions league games and Iâ€™m unable to see them.

conformity,Disappointed,Why should I have to have a cable tv contract to use it?
hedonism,Image jitters over Firestick,Image is not smooth - always a little jitter - like frames are missing.
conformity,Unimpressive,Buffered continuously. Only let me watch for 60 minutes!
conformity,What's the point?,"You have to have tv to use this.  If I have TV, what does the app give me?"
conformity,Not so sporting,"Was a nice thought and hope to see some sports but, as one who does not have cable TV, I was directed to some other subscription options which I didn't want.  So, it didn't work out for me in particular ..."
benevolence,False advertisement!!,I didn't like it at all. It was suppose to show sports which is televised on free channels for example the world series. But as soon as the game started it said I had to subscribe. That doesn't make sense. You want me to pay for free channels...get out of here with that bs !!
hedonism,Easy to use.,Slow and fuzzy but itâ€™s not the worse Iâ€™ve ever seen.
hedonism,PLEASE FIX FAST FORWARD!,"Please fix the fast forward feature.  I even don't care if, like many other streaming apps, you make it where you can't fast forward past commercials.  When you leave the room and the game resets, and you can only fast forward 10 seconds at a time, it is pretty ridiculous. Thx"
conformity,Never got to use it.  :(,I was disappointed to get through the process and then it asks for your cable company. That was the reason we bought the Fire Stick was to cut out the cable bill. So I was never able to use it.
benevolence,Not useful,After adding all these apps to my account it seems as if I'm paying as much as I did with cable.
conformity,Very disappointed that they require that information,"We couldn't get the app to work because we don't have cable or satellite or any TV programming that we pay for - except Amazon Fire!  Before it would download, the app wanted a TV provider and Amazon Fire wasn't even an option.  Very disappointed that they require that information."
benevolence,Does not work,Only works with paid cable not with Amazon Prime.
benevolence,Does not work.,On my Kindle Fire it shuts down as soon as it boots up.  It has worked previously.  I cleared data and cache and even deleted it and reinstalled.  Still doesn't work.
conformity,Worst app ever!,The app constantly says no network connection then you hit retry and it loads in then says the same thing. Obviously I have an active network connect or else I wouldnâ€™t be able to stream using any of the apps on my fire stick
conformity,Disappointing,"I signed on to watch a World Series game, which was great until connection was lost, screen froze, in midst of 9th inning & I missed the big win!!"
hedonism,Not much content,Not great content to watch and a lot of commercials.
benevolence,useless,condemn the athletes & broadcasters for their behavior
hedonism,Freezes on Fire TV,"I have 50 Mbs Internet. I can stream Fox Sports Go fine on my computer. However, it freezes constantly on Fire TV. It freezes so much that I can exit a game and go back to the game and be off by 5 minutes of game time."
conformity,Not worth it,Donâ€™t know why you need a cable provider to use this app.You can get the channel free over the air.If I had a cable provider Iâ€™d just watch the shows that way.
benevolence,Buffers.,need subscription to watch anything.
benevolence,Does not play any game :(,Nothing plays no matter any game you pick
conformity,Not what I expected,I could not watch what I wanted.  THE GAME!
hedonism,can't use,would not take the code to sign no matter how many times I tried kept saying wrong code even though it was on the screen so I just gave up
hedonism,Choppy,"Although it works, the stream is choppy.  It frequently freezes and then plays at fast speeds to catch up.  Not the best, but necessary to watch certain games."
achievement,Didn't work for me,"I downloaded this app to be able to watch NASCAR when we're traveling.  Imagine my surprise when it would not work without signing in with our ""cable provider"".  We have fiber from a local company which was not on their list.  Can't use the app.  Deleted it quickly really aggravated"
benevolence,Worthless!,"Tried to open the app, got a prompt to download an update that does not exsist. Deleted all and reinstalled multiple times as still continue to get prompts to update. Total waste of time and effort!"
conformity,Dont get this if you have firestick and no tv provider,"If you are using internet only to ditch a cable tv provider, Fox Sports Go will not let you use this free app.  They give you a useless code to give to the tv provider...too bad!"
conformity,Unable to stt,I could not access the channel
conformity,Not for me.,Not what I expected. Was hoping to stream games.
hedonism,Kept freezing up during the game!,Wanted to watch the Superbowl in HD and it kept freezing up!
conformity,Couldn't use was not free,I thought it was free and it wasn't
benevolence,Useless to watch anything that isn't live,"Can only time jump 10 seconds at a time. This makes the app basically useless for watching anything that has a pre show or anything like that. I don't feel like sitting here, moving forward 10 seconds at a time for 2 hours just to get to the start of the program. This is 2018, the app feels like 2010."
conformity,Very Disappointing!,I was only able to access sports events that already happened.

achievement,Garbage app,Playback was choppy and not a friendly interface

conformity,Not satisfied,This shows my app downloaded but it just shows a blank screen when we try to watch it.  Not very satisfied :(
hedonism,Video lags 1 to 2 seconds behind au,"Every time I try to watch a MLB game, the video lags 1 to 2 seconds behind the audio.  I have rebooted the device multiple times with no luck.  The fire stick is just two feet away from my wireless router, so distance is not an issue."
hedonism,Couldnâ€™t connect so Iâ€™m no longer interested,Not interested it wouldnâ€™t let me connect so no I donâ€™t want ot
hedonism,Too little sports. Too many commercials,There were so many commercials it was impossible to watch. Far more than cable TV

benevolence,Does not work in my location,Does not work in my location
benevolence,never loads,"Doesn't work at all for me.  It just says ""loading"" and nothing ever comes up.  Don't waste your time on this."
benevolence,Worthless without a t.v. cable provider,"My friend had recently cut the cord with his cable tv provider, and told me that he was unable to get this app to work.  As I too have recently cut the cable tv cord, I am also unable to use this app.  Why do I need this if I still have cable, or Dish?  Pretty much a worthless waste of time, and application."

conformity,Don't do it,Poor quality
benevolence,The app is useless to me for that reason,"I use an Amazon Firestick. I cannot access Fox Sports Go without a cable provider. The app is useless to me for that reason. I have Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Netflix - not cable! I should not have to have a cable provider if I do not want one!"
conformity,Does not work.,I did not like it.  Cannot access anything.  I have internet access only.

hedonism,Worst streaming app I have used.,"App buffers way to much. Quite possibly the worst streaming app I use.  Or attempt to use. No other apps on my fire TV have any problems or issues. Between the buffering and airing the same commercials on every commercial break, the app is just horrible."

conformity,Sucks,A game that was on fox Detroit wasn't on this. Damn shame
benevolence,Useless.,Useless.Why bother?
conformity,Not what I expected from an app,"For those who do not have cable and use streaming apps, this app is disappointing because it gives a brief amount of time before asking to sign in with a cable provider. It would be nice if it would provide the same service as CBS All Access."
conformity,Do not download,Would not recommend very bad.
conformity,One Star,I could not find the game I was wanting to watch.

hedonism,Two Stars,Terrible during world cup. Kept stopping and pixelating
benevolence,Pointless Application,"You have to have a cable subscription to view  live TV. The same live TV that you don't have to pay for if you use a over the air antenna. If Fox live Tv is free over the air, why do you have to have cable subscription to view it on this app?"

achievement,Useless App,The app doesn't work on my Kindle Fire.  Kind of pointless
benevolence,Useless,"Offered by Amazon but you must log into Fox sports go online to activate. They ask you to select your provider but Amazon not listed. They say if your provider not listed, ask them to set up with Fox sports go. Big run around so can't use it."
conformity,Don't bother,"Not what I expected, from FOX. Bummed.."
hedonism,Frustrating!  Need a cable company in order to use app.,"It did not work as we expected. The app provided codes to unlock shows, but it would request to know who your cable company is; we don't have one, so it did not work.  Unless we were missing something, this did nothing for us.  Frustrating!"

hedonism,Constant freezing while watching games.,The app is horrible. It constantly stops for a few seconds to buffer or something. It doesn't go more than two minutes without freezing during soccer games. And I am hard wired with a higher tier Internet connection. Other sports apps work fine on my fire tv.

conformity,Two Stars,Wasn't what I wanted and uninstalled almost immediately
benevolence,Pointless,"Useless. If you want to watch your sports teams while travelling, don't bother getting this app. They give you games which are based on the location of your WiFi connection. So, for example, if you are an Eagles fan and you're visiting Florida, you won't be able to watch the Eagles. You'll get the regional games that are being broadcast in Florida."

hedonism,it was terrible. When commercials would load,"SUPERBOWL, LOL.  Tried to use it to watch the superbowl, it was terrible.  When commercials would load, sometimes it just showed a Fox logo instead of a commercial.  Other times it loaded a commercial but it would lag while trying to load the commercial and freeze on the last frame of the commercial for a few seconds.  During the game it stuttered and dropped frames a bunch of times.  Last year I used the CBS app to watch the superbowl and it was flawless.  Sorry Fox, one star for now, you still have some work to do for 5 star rating."

hedonism,Use this on your Kindle only!,This app works great on my Kindles but sucks on my surface pro 3 . It keeps giving me a media error.
conformity,Disappointed,"I was on YouTubeTv, but wanted the Weather Channel and since Fubo was the same price, it would have been a plus. However, Fubo had too many cons. First, and most importantly, the forward button did not show images as it moved forward so I never knew where I was stopping; the ball on the progression bar was jerky - moved forward, then jerked backward then to the spot I wanted; and you had to push an extra button to get to the progression bar to begin with. Then, too many shows were incomplete - leaving seasons completely out. How can you watch season 3 if you haven't seen season 1 - you lose the whole premise! Then, unlike YouTubeTV where you could jump up to the season number and quickly go to a certain season, you had to pan through every show to get a previous one. I knew in the first day of the free trail that YouTubeTV was better."
hedonism,Glitchy,"We do not like this app and will be cancelling. It does fine for live tv but if you try to watch a series it is horrible. When you pay as much as you do for this app and then they force you to watch 7 commercials every 5 minutes it gets old really fast. You cannot pause it during a commercial break either so if you have to leave the room you will feel like a kid again when you have to hightail it back in to watch.  If you pause the episode you are watching it will error out and then 9 times out of 10 you have to restart from the beginning. It will not let you pick up where you left off.  Forget trying to ff or rewind. It doesn't work. Also, if you are watching a series and you pick an episode you have already seen when you try to go back it exits out of the app instead of just the episode so you have to find your way all the back through. There are way better apps for way less money."
hedonism,Not worth the price and poor poor quality,Poor quality and takes so long to load. I watched FOX sports North and it only worked for 5 minutes and lost connection.  Went to NBA TV to watch WNBA and same thing.  We watched the first half of a game and after the half time it never came back on until there was 1:00 minute left in the game.  Im on the trial first day and Im already canceling it.  SlingTV Blue with extra Sports is cheaper and more reliable.  DirectTVNOW just added CBS to its line up starting next month (Sept) and all I need is NBC live.  Hopefully FuBoTV will get better.
benevolence,Useless. I bought it because I wanted to watch ...,Useless. I bought it because I wanted to watch an important soccer game for World Cup qualifiers. It crashed down and could not see even any channel at all. It kept saying that I didn't have network and yet my other apps like Sling or Amazon were fine. I understand that this happen to many people too. First Bad impressions are difficult to forget.
conformity,Disappointed with service,"I signed up for this App to be able to watch the San Diego Fleet football teams games . After going through the process of signing up, when I attempted to watch the home opener on  Sunday February 17 , your App informed me that that particular game was unavailable. You selling point had been that I WOULD be able to watch AAF games .Very disappointing. I will not continue to use this App .David Cameron"
conformity,Do not waste your time,I gave it a 1 so I could write the review. I have tried two other streaming services and had minimal issues. This is by far the worst thing I have ever tried. Couldn't watch at all. Over a 2 day period nothing would play.
conformity,Technical Difficulties,"I continually struggled logging into Fubo app from both my Firestick and cell phone.  It kept saying that the username or password was incorrect.  However, I could log into my account with those same credentials.  I droppe"
achievement,Very misleading.,"I am away from home for several weeks and my home town NFL team played its opening game on Sunday. I googled 'ways to watch' my team play. Up popped FUBOTV. The add said I could watch NFL games away from my local viewing area, which is true except they pick the teams I can watch, and my home team wasn't one of them. Needless to say, I missed watching my game."
hedonism,Terrible website terrible service,They already charged me and was watching a game and 15 minutes later I was disconnected and couldn't get back in. My internet connection is excellent. The Fubo website kept stating to try again later. I gave up. I want to unsubscribe.
hedonism,Terrible,"Didn't get past the 1st day.  Froze (without exaggeration) every 30 seconds. Such a shame because it was very user friendly, had all the channels we wanted and was affordable but the constant buffering made watching any show impossible."
hedonism,Has some little annoyances,"Like a strange little 5 second repeat that makes you feel like thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a glitch in the matrix.  It also will just randomly stop in the middle of a show and say it canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t play the requested video at the moment...try again later.  I have a brand new Samsung, unlimited internet and none of our other streaming services have these odd occurrences.  Also, I wish it had more 4K programming.  After football seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s over, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need to reassess."
achievement,Doesn't carry as much as advertised.,I'm sure it's a fine streaming app. They advertised having a college football game I wanted to see. So I signed up only to find out that they did NOT have that game. Won't give my money to a company that lies in their advertising.
conformity,Disappointed,"We are very disappointed because we thought we could get all of the NY Giants games (we've lost Fox on Direct TV). It sounded like the game on Sunday 9/22 would be streamed, but it wasn't.  We also found it difficult to navigate the app, but that could be our lack of experience.  All in all, we ended up paying for a month's viewing that we won't use and have discontinued the service. In our opinion, it was a case of false or misleading advertising."
achievement,Waste of money,"Get an amazon fire stick, download kodi, pay $10 a month to iptv realm and get 1000% more channels, all HD.  No blackouts on local sports teams.  It's sad that in america these crap companies have to blackout sports forcing us to give our money to oversees providers that don't have to play the games."
conformity,Not as advertised,"Signed up to get live NFL games, but was only able to access the same game that I can see locally on my cable. Did not give access to other NFL games on at the same time showing in other regions. Waste of time."
conformity,This application was a completely disappointment. I downloaded it on my Fire Stick,"This application was a complete disappointment. I downloaded it on my Fire Stick, and signed for the free trial, and after that it wouldn't go into the whatever is next. It keep saying: Server error. I really encourage them to first try if the server is available before making anyone going trough the signing process. Really bad user experience. I had to go online after that to remove my subscription. And I tried two times."
conformity,"Very disappointed, falsely advertised getting my local channels","I was very disappointed. I tried several times to get questions answered from their customer service before trying it, and the answered some question but not the ones I asked. After signing up, none of my local channels were available. Lots of sports channels, but none that had the Super Bowl or any NFL for that matter. Also no NHL. Overpriced for what you get in my opinion.  I'll still with Sling Orange."
benevolence,Useless,"I signed up the day before Super Bowl 54. It was live all day, up until the game. Then, it displayed a logo and provided only audio as in a Radio Broadcast.I canceled the next day.So much for providing the best in Sports Broadcasting, when it couldn't even broadcast the BIGGEST GAME OF THE YEAR!!!I watched the Spanish Broadcast, for live coverage."
hedonism,Buffering issues,"Interface is great. easy to use but im having some buffering issues. i dont have this type of problem with other steaming services like netflix, hulu, etc but i guess maybe the difference is this is live TV? it was terrible while watching the superbowl. my kids are getting frustrated also while watching their shows Nick jr, etc. likely going to cancel."
conformity,Kept freezing up,"I tried fuboTV for 3 days with their 7 day free trial.  Very disappointed.  It kept freezing up and we had to wait, wait, wait.  Then I unplugged the Amazon Firestick I used for fubo, plugged my cable box back in and the problem went away with my cable service (with no fuboTV service).fuboTV needs a few more years to get its act together."
achievement,Misleading advertising,I did not want to pay for an additional TV service. I was searching for a way to view NBC which was deled from my current cable provider.  I never downloaded this app for the 7-day free trial.  I cannot locate the option to cancel. It is advertised that you may cancel at any time but how?  I deleted this app but received a receipt for the purchase in the amount of $.00 via email.  I fear my credit card will be automatically charged after 7 days even though I did not download the app. It should not be this difficult to cancel.  DO NOT review this app.  This is a nightmare!!
hedonism,So very frustrating!,"I was unable to set up app via Fire TV, so I went online to set up and tried to log in.  I can not get past the initial page explaining charges.  It simply spins and says signing in.  I was eager to use this to catch international matches, but I guess I will have to go to other sources"
benevolence,It didn't work at all.,"It didn't work at all.  I couldn't even log-in.  I started to sign up for an account and after I entered my email and the pw I wanted, I could click on go back or sign-in.  I clicked on sign in and then I was at the beginning again.  It has a program glitch.  My hubby really wanted to watch the Daytona 500 and that didn't happen."
conformity,Really bad experience with this service,Really bad experience with this service. My 3 first recordings did not work so I missed the games. They restored them 2 days after but obviously I already knew the results. Also very poor streaming quality. I hope they improve with time since the selection of sports event is best in market.
hedonism,Buffering,I wish i could give it 0 stars. The only reason i am sticking with it for now is because the competitor does not have more channel lineups.Every live game across all networks buffers. There is no buffering when i use the Fubo tv login credentials on the channel itself ( nbcsn for example).My internet speeds are more than 200 Mbps so that is not a reason for buffering.
hedonism,terrible,"We're trying different streaming services. Fubo is by far the worst. It constantly hangs, and the picture is bad. It's also the most expensive. Terrible."
conformity,Don't waste your time,I would have given zero stars if that was an option. Everything was in Spanish and I couldn't figure out how to switch it to English. I called the customer service number (which is automated) and it said it couldn't find my account. I cancelled it within 30 minutes of starting. Save yourself the headache. Don't waste your time. There are plenty of other options that work.
hedonism,Disappointed,What surprise me was the lack of staying connected. It couldn't have been my wifi because the other streaming apps did not lag or would time out like Fubo app did.  Twice I had to completely restart the Fubo app in order to get it going again.  Not happy whatsoever..
hedonism,Not as advertised,"I have it one star because you can't give any fewer. I signed up for this to watch the Kentucky Derby, after they advertised they were airing it, only to find out they were only airing the preliminary races and not the derby. After the nightmare of the sign up process, I was very unhappy to find out I could not watch the race. Canceled immediately."
achievement,One Star,"This app was not user friendly, it was difficult to maneuver from channel to channel"
achievement,WasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t what I expected!,Was disappointed when It continually stalled when I used it. I Could not find many get programs I wanted to watch. I was hoping to see many college football games since I no longer subscribe to cable or direct TV.
conformity,Confusion,"Along with many other web offers, I found this one to be very difficult to understand, and even more difficult to access. Plus, the terms, such as ""when will my offer be renewed?"" were very difficult to determine."
conformity,Product Sucks,"Never could get the service working. downloaded app, then setting it up it wouldn't take my credit cards.. now I can't delete it. Sick of these BS apps and setups"
achievement,Not as advertised,"The ad said I could watch the game. Yeah, it records the game and you get to watch it after ""the live event"". Then they want $45 a month? I don't think so Tim. I thought I could watch a live game. This app didn't even make 24 hours."
hedonism,Very poor channel guide,"Glitch. Glitch. Glitch. Buffering. Buffering. Buffering. Very poor channel guide. Worth the free 7 day trial ... after that, your wasting your money."
achievement,Too much money for the few I'd watch,The stream quality wasn't great. Buggered and stalled from time to time even froze. My biggest problem is the price. $700 a yr for the same collection of channels everyone is offering of which you only watch maybe 10.
conformity,Not happy with customer service,"I signed up for a 7 day free trial the day of the Super Bowl for the halftime show and forgot to cancel until the day it renewed (8 days later), because the messages were going to junk mail. I called the same day I was charged and it was ""renewed"" for $59.99 for the coming month. NO REFUND, NI MERCY - RIDICULOUS AND BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE"
hedonism,CouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t watch,This app is lame. We wanted to watch the World Cup. We click on this app and it requires you to go online and enter a code. I was using our TV thru amazon fire and didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to mess with getting out my laptop. I hate apps / shows that advertise on amazon fire but you really canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t watch them - itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s frustrating
benevolence,I can't get it to work,"It keeps asking me to sign in, does not, will not recognize any email I provide. Will not allow me to set up an acct. Useless app as far as I am concerned. Going to uninstall it."
benevolence,Junk,If you like spending $20 for absolutely nothing then this is for you!!!!
hedonism,Not worth $60 a month,"DoesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the local ABC channel, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to glitchy on the menu. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m currently using YouTube TV and it has local ABC channel but missing A&E but performs better and is $5 a mo. cheaper. Will be switching and dropping Fubu TV"
conformity,Unsatisfatory,Never able to stream it. Am not inter stead in it. Too much trouble and Amazon Customer Service could not help or resolve the problem. I do not want to subscribe to it.
hedonism,Way too many commercials,More than 20 commercials in a one hour show. Considering the monthly cost I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see how they can justify that much advertising without the ability to skip commercials.
benevolence,Not as advertised!,Would not purchase again. Very expensive for channels you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really need. They say it works across three devices but I could only get it to work on my cell phone. WouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work on TV or computer. Beware!
conformity,Not As Advertised,We signed up so we could watch the Rams/Patriots game. All over the internet websites and Fubo showed that it would be available on Fubo. But it was NOT available for viewing...at least in our area. Disappointing.
conformity,Not impressed,Very confusing trying to find on demand shows.  Not very user friendly.  Also football game that claimed to be on was no where to be found.
achievement,DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t waste your money,Purchased for my husband to watch his favorite teams. Only not find the game anywhere. I deleted the app before the free trial is even up
hedonism,Lack of usability,"It's UI is just laggy & not very intuitive. The mobile app is a little better, plus 30hrs of DVR storage is lame. YouTube TV gives you unlimited DVR recordings for 8 months or so. Also, no ABC/ESPN/Disney family of channels. And it's too damn expensive for what you get & how polished the Smart TV app is."
conformity,Not impressed.,"Signed up to watch a sporting event and give it a try, the sporting event they touted was blocked. Could not get any of the on demand, or previous programming to load. Kept saying try again. The live programming is not very user friendly. Have to keep going out of app, and then back in, most of the time spent searching for something to watch, noticed no ABC programming as well?"
hedonism,Not worth the hassle or the price,So frustrating to set up - worse than similar products. And ultimately didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have what we wanted to watch (football game)
benevolence,Not free as listed.,"I did not like that is lists as free, but it is not free. After download, when selecting a program to watch, a popup directs to website for one week free. So, I immediately uninstalled this app."
benevolence,It doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work,I turned on HG TV and the audio turned on and then came on with a second of delay and the audio continued after I closed the app and opened a different app
hedonism,Bad quality. Stream cut out in the middle of ...,Bad quality. Stream cut out in the middle of the game and was never restored. I used YouTube TV instead.
conformity,Doesn't get the sports I want,Too expensive for what I want - mainly because it doesn't get enough sports even though it advertises that it does.
hedonism,Movies lagging,"I have tried to watch a movie 3 times now and it keeps lagging, and I know it's not our internet, because our movies don't lag Netflix and work fine."
achievement,Too much $$$,Way too expensive for what you get. I will be cancelling before the end of my free trial. Just not worth it.
hedonism,Awkward to use with Forests k,Couldn't get to the menu/ guide while watching a program.  Slow switching between channels.  For the price not worth it.
benevolence,The worst app ever,"You can't access it. They send you a code to connect but it comes up with email/password page that even if you create an account, doesn't let you in to connect. Absolute worst."
conformity,Not worth it,No auto play of next episode...so loading up of next episode is cumbersome.  There are only a couple of episodes readily available for viewing so binge watching is out.  Connection/playback issues.
hedonism,constant freeze,"Every time I have turned it on, it freezes.  I have to shut off my T>V. and start over. Somebody said Internet Speed too slow.  I checked that and seems to be fine."
achievement,Misleading,"Wanted to check out NHL Network which was listed as one of their channels.  But i started my free trial and wasn't included.  from what I could see,  it was an add-on after the trial ended"
benevolence,False Advertising,The advertisement said I could watch The World Series on this channel but I found out that was not true!
hedonism,Live stream kept buffering.,Purchased to watch an out of region game on NBA TV. The game was blocked out on PS Vue. Great that we were able to get the game but the stream buffered every 30 seconds. Very annoying. My internet is 100mb down on fiber. My device was hard wired. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ever have bu
benevolence,Meh,"I decided to try Fubu specifically because it said that I would be able to get the local stations. The stations were available, but upon review of the guide the programming was very different from the locals on cable. It was rather pointless for me."
conformity,Disappointed,Add said it was free. Only for a trial period then you have to buy a subscription.
benevolence,Meh...,Got this to watch NFL games. Never saw a game with it. Deleted it within 24 hours.
benevolence,False advertising about what channels are available outside of the USA.,Unfortunately does not show all the channels they advertise outside of the USA. Signed up thinking that was the case but there was no disclaimer. Wasted money and effort. Streaming picture is great and amongst the best but didn't like the fact they weren't up front about the programming.
conformity,Not what I thought,"I never watched anything because it is not free. I downloaded it thinking it was, trying to see the playoffs. So of course it gets low marks from me."
achievement,Do not waste your money,Terrible. What a waste. You pay such high $ for shows only to have to wait! Cancelled ASAP!
benevolence,Scam,"The signal was so weak, the image kept freezing,  until it failed completely and never came back we couldn't finish watching the soccer game. That was the reason we signed up for. A total scam!!!"
conformity,too expensive,Not what I expected. Way toooo expensive. Difficult in every way. Sorry
hedonism,Eh,Fubo is a great idea but the streaming quality is not always the best. They advertise that you can watch shows on demand but only a minimal amount of channels actually have their shows on demand. The commercials will repeat and never get back to the show when watching on demand.
achievement,Great content but slightly awkward interface,"Great content, but slightly awkward interface makes it difficult to select particular  events and days.  The availability of sports content not available elsewhere makes it all worthwhile."
conformity,Disappointing,Tried this specifically to watch the Chicago Bears on December 16 and was unable to do so. I cancelled the service.
conformity,We do NOT recommend it!,We have not had access because the app will not let us log in.  There is no customer service person to consult with or cancel with.  We do NOT recommend that anyone try this app.
conformity,Too Complicated,I wanted to watch a show and all it wanted to do was record it.
conformity,Not what I thought I was getting,Not Free and the content is not what I want.  I will not use it!
conformity,Not Quite What Expected!,Didn't really stream well and couldn't get the game we wanted!
hedonism,App loads slow,Got tired of att and sling showing theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re symbol during commercials. Went to Fubo more channels for same price. App does load a little slow but so did att.
conformity,DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get this app.,Poor service. I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t watch none of my shows or movies that I wanted too.
hedonism,Poor connections,"I tried this in multiple different locations, was always lagging and pausing sometimes timing out."
achievement,Mis-leading capabilities of what they can offer.  Pay attention to the wording.,"Their ads are mis- leading.  But, you only find out after you sign up.  Their is noone to call prior to subscribing."
hedonism,Too much buffering,Buffers too much would have loved to keep it but???
hedonism,Big Waste of Time,"Couldn't get any of the bowl games I wanted to watch, yes it was free, but had nothing i was interested in."
hedonism,Poor streaming,Had high hopes but just constant buffering issues.
conformity,Very Disappointed,Fubo was advertised as free and not until I download it on my smart TV did I find that it was only free for a week and then you were going to start charging me. I never signed up for it. I downloaded it and never used it. I expect that I will not be receiving a bill.
conformity,Wouldn't accept my debit card as a metohd of payment,I couldn't use the service and i stayed on hold for over an hour and couldn't get it resovled.
benevolence,Usless for espn,Usless.. Still couldn't watch a football game on espn without cable or something.
conformity,Don't bother,You have to put a credit card in to watch.
conformity,So so,I thought it would have more of a selection of sports.
benevolence,Fubu,"I couldn't get it to work, so I need to cancel it."
benevolence,Waste of money,This app didn't work at all. We couldn't consistently watch the football games that we wanted to. It would say it was loading but it never did.
hedonism,Unable to open,I can't open the app!! It keeps telling me that I don't have an account. And prompts me to purchase the app again.
hedonism,Cost the same as my cable,Did not save me any money over my cable.
hedonism,Slow,"Buffered and degraded picture quality several times.  Does not happen with other apps, services."
conformity,Disappointing,We got this to watch football.  Doesn't work most of the time.  Haven't been able to watch a game all the way through due to error messages.  Amazon fire tv.  Disappointing.
conformity,Not that great,I was not impressed. The main reason I tried it was for rugby which they say they show. That was laughable.
conformity,My Evaluation,Too much latency and no ESPN channels
conformity,Disappointed,Not what I expected based on other downloads.
benevolence,Scam I did not authorize.,I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what this is or why it is here. Some scam.
hedonism,Cost too much for limited movies,"85 dollars too much, limited movies"
hedonism,It never worked,"Impossible to set up. It is stuck asking for my email and saying that the id user is not correct. Really frustrating, but is not that important making it works. Try a better one."

hedonism,Picture,Problems with internet speed.
hedonism,This is NOT a live stream,"We got this to be able to watch the NHL Playoffs.  However, the game cut out with three minutes left in regulation.  They are apparently only buying a specific amount of time from the networks that do NOT include any overtime or delays.  VERY frustrating."
benevolence,Its all Fubar.,Could never sign in. Nothing but errors. Every other streaming service works fine.
conformity,Its all Fubar.,Its all Fubar.
conformity,Disappointing,I wanted something more like cable where I could watch network TV shows. I couldn't find ANYTHING on FUBO. I cancelled it before my free trial was over. Don't waste your money.
benevolence,Not what it says it is false advertising,Ordered to watch super bowl in 4KTotal rip off game was in Spanish and was broadcast in 720p
hedonism,Starting to have issues,"Price seems to edge up every other month. And now the programs are suddenly buffering although we're running at fastest WiFi speed, & every other video app runs fine"
benevolence,Sucks,Paid to watch the chicago Bears ands they're not listed. Getting an immediate refund!
conformity,Sports,It was a disappointment.
benevolence,Soso,I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like this app! I was trying to watch something That was said to be on there and it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t so I deleted it! That simple....that quick!!
hedonism,some free movies,not enough free movies
conformity,DISAPPOINTING,Attempted to watch Minnesota Gopher game to be on the BTN and instead a a different college game was playing.We checked out other options in the program disappointing the options had so many commercials you forget what you are watching.
conformity,Missing Football,It didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a lot of football Ã°Å¸
conformity,picture quality poor,The picture quality was poor during peak viewing hours
conformity,Terrible,I could never get on the product.  It gave me a sign on code I was to enter on my mobile device but when I went to the link provided there was no place to enter the code.  Could not watch game because could not get onto tv.
hedonism,Doesn't stream most times.,It rarely works on my lap top and I can't get it to work with my Fire TV Stick either.
hedonism,Not a big fan,Not really a fan
conformity,"Poor quality picture, not ready for prime time","Awful picture quality, 720P max resolution, but usually much less. Terrible on a 4k TV."
conformity,Not what I expected,Did not stream the games that it recommended
achievement,Better streaming options,Poor interface
conformity,Went back to cable,"Picture and sound wouldn't load at the same time, had to exit out of app and try again. Poor picture quality. Cancelled service"
benevolence,Waste,Don't waste your time. Only certain sports and teams not all
conformity,Disappointed,CouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find what we wanted
conformity,"I was not expecting ""forced"" commercials @ $65/mth","I was considering dropping dish, so I figured I would give this a try first.At $65/mth, I was not expecting the ""forced "" commercials that cannot be skipped...Also, would not let me record MNF at all.Will not be continuing with Fubo when the free trial ends..."
benevolence,The app wont open even after purchase,I was able to download the app and its updates but it wont open for me to watch. I would've gave it 0 stars across the board but since this is how the set up goes that's why it got 1 star.
conformity,Worst ever,THE worst ever. Worked few minutes during a soccer game on Tuesday. I already canceled my subscription
hedonism,Wouldn't use,I was not happy with the service the shows were freezing up
achievement,Junk.,And misleading. No where did I see that I would have to sign up for a fee.
hedonism,Glitches,Worst quality streaming service that I have tried so far in my search to replace cable.The volume levels vary from channel to channel. I have had to close the app and reopen it several times when my show would stop playing or the guide wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t load. Frustrating!!
benevolence,Trash! Garbage! Absolute waste!,This was the first of three streaming services I tried to watch an NFL game. This and both others were absolute trash.  Don't waste your time. Again I wish Amazon let me rank this trash no stars.
achievement,Not for me,Decent but not for me
hedonism,Has potential,The selection of channels is great. This app does freeze up and slow down the Firestick though. After watching Fubo we have to force stop apps and restart the Firestick to watch other apps. If this issue is corrected then Fubo would be terrific.
achievement,Too many sports,Decent...but not for me.
hedonism,Works,Not many options
hedonism,Great App,Not interesting.
hedonism,this app doesn't work - Colombia,"This app doesn't work. I can't watch any channel or matches. In the menu option ""Matches"", it always displays "" there was an issue with that request, please try again"". In the menu option ""Channels"", it always displays "" Internal server error!""."

benevolence,RIP-off artists,I cancelled my subscription before the trial had ended. They still charged me. I called too get my money back and they told me they were unable too because they dont do refunds... lame... my friends and some family wont even use them because of my experience..
conformity,Disappointed.,Husband tried to get Super Bowl game. Unable to get it.
conformity,Very disappointed that the live sports wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t what we expected.,We tried fubo as our cable is no longer getting our favorite sports and tv shows. As football season is kicking off we thought this would be the answer. Very disappointed that the live sports wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t what we expected.
conformity,Poor stream and overall quality,The streaming was terrible. We tried to watch a couple different live streams and the connection was awful. We tried a different live stream service and had no connection issues so we knew it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t our internet service causing the poor quality
conformity,Not what I wanted,The way it was advertised I thought I could stream out of market NFL but you cannot. Glad  only did the trial because it was not what I wanted at all.

achievement,Bad move !!,I want my money back !!!!
benevolence,Worst stream service,If I could give it less I would. I tried it to watch football but they are just like local tv you get one game but yet they want you to spend 40 dollars for it when you can get local channels for free
conformity,Inaccurate information,Said on app I would be able to watch the Dallas Cowboys game and I was not able to.This was a complete waste of my time!!!VERY DISAPPOINTED
hedonism,Don't expect ease of Use,"We did not find this service at all easy to use and found it too difficult to navigate without the traditional remote.Also, the freezing of the video, randomly, throughout a show, was too annoying to ignore."

benevolence,Presently not worth it until issues resolved!,"It has potential and they have the right idea for the futbol fans. Sorry, but this app did not work 90% of the time. Every time I tried opening it, it kept eternally saying ""loading"" and never opened up. Also, they did not have the EuroCup. If they can improve it I will certainly give it another try in the future."
hedonism,Less freezing and easier way to change channels.,I disliked that it kept freezing up and sometimes you cut it on and the sound of two channels would be playing at once. I was using this to cut the cable from satellite.
conformity,Down during final round of World Cup Qualifying,The entire streaming service went completely down during final stage of World Cup Qualifying. This is what most would use it for. Has potential but this was a major setback.
hedonism,Do not get the content expeected.,We were expecting to find a streaming channel with a LIVE football game.  We are not interested in the gamers & bettors need for information.  Never found a LIVE game to watch on a Sunday afternoon.  Very sad!

Was told to change my password and that would fix it. It didn't. So we created a new account to avoid getting kicked off, and they flagged us and blocked us from signing up for a free trial. I asked if we could proceed without the free trial, as we are willing to continue paying for the service, and I was told we were blocked from signing up ever again. A little disappointed considering we loved Fubo and would love to continue paying for the service."
hedonism,Terrible quality,"This was the worst live stream tv app/site that I have tried. As soon as we started watching it was very pixelated and jumpy and kept freezing. It did not stream clearly at all. After about 5 times of it stopping, saying that they were having technical difficulties, I cancelled my trial."

hedonism,Another Useless App That Requires a Cable Provider,"What exactly is the point of a streaming app that requires a provider connection? If I already have a provider service, that probably has a DVR device, this app (and the service it provides) is completely useless. NBC Sports, please hop into the present and provide a true streaming app.No one needs cable any more so drop the provider requirement and join the new paradigm."
benevolence,Not Working on any of my Fire TV devices.,"I have been using this app for over a year and about two or three weeks ago it has stopped working on any of my Fire TV devices. The app loads but all I get is a cryptic message ""an error has occurred"". I have tried every suggestion and nothing has worked."
hedonism,Constant.  Buffering....  Unwatch...able....,"Impossible to watch with all the freezing and buffering.I am hardwired via ethernet with a 50 mbps fiber connection (which usually tests closer to 60 mpbs) and the streams from this app are unwatchable making the app worthless.  I can stream the game on my tablet via my cable provider's app flawlessly and I can stream other apps on my fire tv without issue so there's no doubt it's the terrible NBC Sports app that is giving me trouble.  What can you expect for a free channel - what's that? Oh that's right, NBC Sports requires a costly cable subscription even for games streamed live OTA via antenna.  What can you expect for a paid channel?  Apparently nothing."
hedonism,Dont bother,Cuts to commercial about every two minutes.  This app is a colossal waste of my time.  WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had live streaming apps for several years now and this is what NBC lays before us?  Complete garbage.
benevolence,Un-Happy,"Thank you for the free 30 minutes of viewing the Olympics.  Also, thank you for the 20 minutes of commercials that also counted towards that free 30 minutes so really, 10 minutes of the Olympics.  So, what I should really say is:  Thank you for the free app that I have to have a TV/Cable service to use properly (which is the exact same EXPENSIVE service I got rid of)  So, this is a pretty useless app for those of us that Cut the Cord."
conformity,Poor app,"Absolutely a waste of time.  No search feature available to find events, backing to arrow through  is ridiculous. Beyond that, all you have is NBCs ""highlights""  edit and worthless commentary; with more commercial length than actual event coverage.  I long for the days when ABC was the leader in sports coverage. Live events, factual and to the point auditories, and no political or broadcast politics. It has 1 star because I cannot rate it lower. In diving it would rate a failed dive."
conformity,So disapponted that this is being forced to watch coverage ...,So disapponted that this is being forced to watch coverage of the Winter Olympics.  We cut the cable but cannot get NBC over the air in our location.  So planning to watch this was squashed when you must have a paid TV service.  What happened to network television that has always been free.  Shame NBC.
hedonism,Super Annoying App.,"Pixelated games of hockey are hard to watch cause you can't see the puck.  Freezes up almost every game towards the end of the game. Super annoying when it's a game in overtime. Then I restart it to try and get it going and end up having to watch commercials and then I miss the end. It has happened so many times crazy.On the ""Live"" page,  the start time of games disappears and a ""play"" emoji appears, way before the game starts.They also have been playing the same ONE commercial for over a year.  Yeah, I've been a customer for like 2 years and the same commercial has been the only commercial they use."
hedonism,"Great content, poor app. Very frustrating.","Unfortunately all of the sports that NBC has purchased are trapped behind this incredibly frustrating app. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve used it for years now, and I would guess IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been asked to authorize the app more than 50 times. Netflix, Hulu, heck even crackle arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t constantly prompting for logins.Browsing a program is also difficult. Of course I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expect to fast forward through commercials, but seeking a point in a replay is done by skipping ahead 10 seconds at a time. It does feature a seek function by pausing and fast forwarding, but that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work.If it worked as designed it would be outstanding, but as seems to be the theme with the traditional networks, it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m excited for the day Netflix picks up the Premier League and Amazon the NFL."
achievement,Not happy. It would be nice to have clear app requirements & apps that actually work!,"It never worked. Signing up for some of these apps is very misleading. Prior to downloading,  the app does not tell you before you download it that you must have cable or satellite or a membership to Hulu or any of the other server type apps in order for the apps to work.  So it's a waste of time to download then set up the account and then find out at the end of setting up the account that you need one of these other services in order for the app to work. Apps need to be more upfront with what's required before you do all the downloads."
hedonism,glitches constantly,"Constantly glitching. Would give a spinning wheel consistently about every 3-5 minutes and then cut to 3-5 min of commercials (presumably ones provided by the app, not the network, because it was the exact same commercials and it would often cut off what someone was actually saying on the livestream). Just horrible bugs that need to be worked out. Impossible to watch a live game. You're better off getting an antenna and standing at the window holding it for reception."
benevolence,What an awful SCAM 29 minutes into viewing the opening ...,What an awful SCAM 29 minutes into viewing the opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics the channel goes black and I spend the next 2 hours trying to figure out how to view the games. Ended up having to buy a $49.99 subscription to Hulu. What a manipulative scam NBC ruined my Friday Night!!!
hedonism,Too many commercials!,"Very disappointed in this app.  IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a Spectrum TV Cable subscriber, but when I entered my credentials I received a message that NBC doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a streaming agreement with Spectrum.  I used credentials from Cox Communications and was able to get the app to work. Then I find out that commercials interrupt the Olympic programming all too often, the app buffers a lot and when you switch to different events youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re forced to watch the same annoying commercial that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve already seen 20 times only to discover that Ã¢â‚¬Å“the coverage is completed Ã¢â‚¬Å“or a different event entirely. Terrible job NBC!  Makes me long for the days of ABCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Wide World of Sports and Jim McKay."
hedonism,Delayed while watching the super bowl. Smh,I was able to watch the Super Bowl for free with my amazon prime membership but it was very delayed and was not playing the game in real time. I was still watching the game when my fiancÃƒÂ© called me from work to tell me that the eagles won. It was a bummer that the entire world knew who won and that the game was over and I still had about 5 minutes left to watch.
conformity,Disappointed.,"Wanting to watch a sports program on something larger than my computer screen, I downloaded the NBC Sports app to my Fire TV.  When I tried to activate the app, it refused to accept my login information.  After several attempts, I gave up, uninstalled the app and went back to watching on my small computer screen"
conformity,Terrible,DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t waste your time even if you are cutting the cord. Easily 30% of content is commercials one cannot skip. Just DVR the programs and delay your watching by 30 minutes: at least you can skip the odious commercials
hedonism,Unhappy,"I thought I would be able to get this using my Fire Stick and my HD antenna. Unfortunately it does not. It requires me to have some sort of cable or satellite service that I pay for. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m very unhappy about this! I got the NBC SN when I had satellite, and the point is to eliminate that expense!"
benevolence,"useless app, activation code comes on the screen on ","useless app, activation code comes on the screen on Tv and you enter it into your laptop, then it says you need another code so you type that in, can't get past this using Amazon Fire TV box. After 3 dAY OF trying I deleted it. I installed the app on my table and it works. I have installed 30 something apps on the fire tv box, this is not my first rodeo"
benevolence,Useless app,"This app is virtually useless unless you pay for cable or satellite TV service. And if you do then what are you doing trying to watch it on Amazon for? All apps that require paid TV service should be band from the App Store. The reason you bought the Amazon Fire stick in the first place was so that you wouldn't have to pay for TV service. And if you do pay for service you'd be watching that service, not trying to get it on the fire stick."
hedonism,I wasn't happy to have to download something to watch golf!,I am upset to have to download something to watch golf. I think you'll lose a bunch of followers if you continue with Peacock or any other download.I know I won't go through the frustration again.
hedonism,Glitchy,"I very much like that I can stream Sunday night football... but it is SO glitchy!  Often throughout programming, it buffers and repeats what has already been played - which in and of itself is annoying but then when this happens a few times, the lag between what is being watched and real time is considerable. When they figure out how to fix this, I think itâ€™ll be a decent app."
achievement,TERRIBLE!!!!!,"It would be nice if they told you had to have a cable TV provider for this to work. What is the point of having a Firestick if you have cable?I was led to believe this app would allow me to watch the Olympics, NOT the case!I live in an area where cable isn't available, after talking with troubleshooting techs I was told I could subscribe to Sling TV and pay their $25 package and watch all events live. Nope, still need a TV provider and a code to make it work.I would rate a zero if that would have been an option. Very misleading!"
hedonism,Very poor picture quality,"We downloaded for the Super Bowl because we do not pick up NBC through antenna. The entire game was very grainy. It was as if we were watching the game through an old analog TV from 1988. It also had moments where it had to buffer, but that wasnâ€™t too bad. I just donâ€™t understand why the picture quality was so poor."
hedonism,Pointless,"What's the point of having an app, if you have to sign in using your cable provider?  The point of having prime is to forego having a cable provider."
achievement,Misleading,"After reading these reviews I now understand what it means when my tv screen asks for credentials. I am new to the Fire Stick and was just coming to realize what it meant. I don't have cable/dish and feel Amazon also misleads what you can watch. Luckily, I have Prime and Netflix, but then, I  really wouldn't need the stick, would I? I could also just subscribe to HULU or Sling and be happier."
conformity,Not impressed,"I use Amazon fire tv for streaming , while watching super bowl pregame show I got constant buffering. Ended up going to over air waves antenna and watching it on local channel with no issues. Not sure what issue was trying t o stream via Amazon."
hedonism,Sad,Application would not let me connect even with my correct service provider. Customer service responded but was unable and unwilling to look further
benevolence,What a waste of time and energy,This app does not work unless you already have it on cable or satellite!  The reason we wanted it was because we were not gong to ever be tied to those expensive companies again.This is a why bother app.  Don't waste your time.
conformity,Not useful since NBC won't take the activation code,"Loaded this on my FIRE-TV and went to the NBCSports dot COM/Activate page.  Selected FIRE TV and XFINITY; No matter what I tried, NBC will not take the activation code.  Rebooted the FIRE, requested new code multiple times, nothing.  Highly disappointing."
conformity,useless,I used the supplied codes two time and could not get on to watch the hockey game; just a waste of time and very disappointing. How do I delete this site from my TV?
hedonism,Didn't work for me,"I'm not sure whether it was my internet connection or the NBC Sports feed, but the Super Bowl was buffering so badly that it was 10 to 15 minutes behind over-the-air broadcast before halftime.  I eventually gave up and watched the game on an older TV with an indoor over-the-air antenna."
hedonism,Waste of time,"I may cancel my prime membership over the difficulty using this app. It's useless to watch and right before a game starts, it's throws up a requirement to enter my log in information for my provider, which I don't have any longer. Total waste of my time and effort. Amazon has to do a better job of explaining what is included in prime and what is not, and what can be accessed.Not happy at all"
achievement,Not user friendly,"Liked the ability to choose what events to watch.  Do not like the fast forward option....ObvIously, can not fast forward through the commercials, but you can not tell where you are when fast forwarding through an event.  You have to guess using a little progress bar....awkward."
hedonism,Buffering issue,"Watched the nascar race yesterday using my amazon fire stick. Not sure if the constant buffering was nbc, or the device, but I saw the race.."
conformity,App keeps crashing,"NBC needs to fix this app. It keeps crashing, and each time the only way to fix it is to completely reset my firestick (even wiping the data from the app and re-installing it doesn't work). Then I have to re-download all the apps onto the firestick. When it's working it's fine; I pay for NBC Sports Gold so I can watch Premier League games, and it's great for that. But it crashes fairly often and then everything has to be wiped and reset."
conformity,Disappointing,I downloaded the NBC Sports App so that I could watch the Sunday Night Football.  The app it self works fine but it won't allow me to watch the live Sunday Night Footbal.  Very disappointing....
conformity,No recommended if you dont have Cable.,Very disappointed that NBC doesn't have an option to subscribe just with them only. Pretty much you have to be subscribed to a cable company to be able to watch. I cut the cord long time ago and I pay for things I only use (very happy about it) too bad for NBC not having subscription options.  They better think about it.
hedonism,Horrible,It sucks. Constant buffering. Every time you leave and come back to nbc sports Boston you have to suffer through that Nissan commercial weather or not the program is in an actual break. Wish I could give it no stars!
benevolence,totally worthless unless you are first subscribed to a cable network,"though we could enjoy this for watching some olympic events, but even with this app, you need to be getting ripped off by a cable company before it will work."
conformity,Worthless,This was horribly disappointing. I wanted the app because I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a TV provider. Finding out I needed one To use the app was totally defeating the purpose. I would not recommend this app system to anyone.
hedonism,Slow,It works a little slow during live games and doesn't seem as integrated and updated as other apps.
conformity,Totally sucks!!!!,pushing how you can catch all the action from the RIO OLYMPICS??? Then it crashes on everything if you're not on a google product??? Horrendous waste of time.
conformity,Don't waste your time,"We downloaded this app to watch the Olympics, but all we got to see where bits and pieces of events. This was the worst Olympic coverage ever."
hedonism,This app sucks!,WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve not been able to get it to work. The app takes us in circles and is incredibly frustrating.  Surely NBC could do better.
benevolence,Totally useless you must have cable TV to get this and ...,Totally useless you must have cable TV to get this and why would you get this if you have cable TV would already be included I tried every which way I could to receive content but to no avail don't bother.
conformity,Maybe I Didn't Record Correctlyt,I only got highlights of the cycling race.  I thought I was recording the entire race.  Somewhat disappointed.
achievement,Misleading,I only got highlights of the cycling race.  I thought I was recording the entire race.  Somewhat disappointed.
achievement,misleading,"got this for the olympics but it only works if you have cable, why not state that in the app description?"
conformity,Doesnâ€™t work,I downloaded this app to watch the British open.  It stalled on a black screen and would only show a couple minutes of programming each hour that would actually load.  Very disappointed.
conformity,Terrible,Hardly ever works and when it does it still sucks
benevolence,Totally useless to me,"They don't mention in the description that it doesn't work unless you are a cable tv subscriber.  Totally useless to me, a Hulu Live TV user."
hedonism,Buffers way too much,"When this app works it provides a sharp picture and fine sound. Unfortunately, the picture buffers frequently. It is very frustrating to watch a spinning yellow arrow instead of a sporting event. I have a 75 MB/sec connection and other streaming apps work fine. If NBC could work out the bugs they would have a winner."
benevolence,"Does not work, period. Even though NBC is ..","Does not work, period. Even though NBC is an over the air network, they require a cable log in. When I used my cable log in, they would not accept it for this app. There is also a free ""30"" minute preview that they shut off after 22 minutes. Useless"
benevolence,Garbage,garbage have to have cable tv service to use this. completely stupid.
conformity,Waste of time,Disappointed to find out I would have to have a smart TV or a tv subscription to access the Olympics.  Even after signing up for spectrum tv I still couldn't access it.  Huge disappointment
hedonism,We are not happy with this app at all,"The MLB app doesn't give you the entire showing of the games it states it will play.  We are not happy with this app at all.  Do yourself a favor, and don't purchase this app."
achievement,Misleading description on apps,The previews for this app specifically stated no need to log in with cable provider and 20 mins into the football game it logged out and would not go back with out further requirements. Misleading and very disappointing. I will not use this app again and now am leery of others
hedonism,Not happy!!!,"CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t use it by streaming, you need a tv provider. Discrimination!!!!!"
benevolence,Did not load,Would not display anything. Deleting

hedonism,Bad Streaming,Streaming was inconsistent!
benevolence,"Worthless app for watching Premier League - ""Unable to play this asset""","You can forget watching Premier League matches with this app. I get the common ""Unable to play this asset"" only on Premier League matches. All other shows play fine. I am using version 3.2 of this app. Version 4 is even worse as it just says ""An error has occured."" Worthless in every way."
achievement,DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bother,Got it to watch olympics. It showed a few intro clips and rhat was all. The interface is confusing.

conformity,Constant Crashing,"The app crashes every time I try to stream the game. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve authenticated multiple times and checked my bandwidth (other streaming apps work), nothing works."
conformity,Wish the video was smoother,The biggest complaint is stream quality. Seemed kind of herky jerky and not very smooth. Not sure what the problem there is.
hedonism,Needs more broadcasts sports and make it easier to see Shows / video like Mike Florio,"Watched super bowl.  Noticed it had a 1 minute delay over my antenna.  Also, had service interruptions on my wifi?  Not sure I will ever use the other features?"
hedonism,Watch ads and pay for them! Get yours now.,I tried the free half hour to see if it would be worth paying for to see the Olympics. The answer is a resounding 'NO'. There were so many commercials during that 30 minutes. I was shocked!

hedonism,"HORRIBLE, FRUSTRATING AND USELESS.",I just want to watch the French Open live and I don't have a cable subscription BECAUSE I GOT ALL THESE STUPID APPS TO REPLACE AN OVERLY EXPENSIVE CABLE PACKAGE. What is WRONG with NBC that they don't realize that the market is shifting?! This app is deeply frustrating and completely useless. Don't waste your time on it.
achievement,Not worth it,DidnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work for me
hedonism,Too many commercials,"Too many commercials, will cut right into a Olympic event to show the same commercial  you've seen 100 times. Horrible, NBC should lose their rights to broadcast the Olympics."
conformity,Disappointed that I always fight with this app,I get an error code for parental controls. But it doesn't let me change parental controls anywhere. Disappointed that I always fight with this app.
hedonism,"Wait... still ""buffering""","This has been a terrible and worthless download. We can never get the highlights to work. It's constantly buffering, even for footage a couple of days old. Might as well watch it on TV and record what events you want to see - or if you don't have TV, just be severely patient, and I'm sure it will come up eventually."
benevolence,Does not work,This app does not work at all.  It gives countless activation codes that when you put in just tell you they aren't valid.
benevolence,It didn't work for me because I didn't have the .,It didn't work for me because I didn't have the channels on my dish channels.  Whay was the use of having Amazon prime when I couldn't use it stand alone.

conformity,Too Hard to Get Connected,Too hard to get connected.  I gave up.
benevolence,Pointless if you don't already have Cable TV service.,The entire point of the Amazon Fire stick for me was too dump cable.  An app that requires me to have a cable service to watch programming is useless.
hedonism,Needs massive improvements,So many problems to get started then to have the picture freeze and stop
benevolence,Another useless app,"If you don't have cable, this app is useless.  And if you have cable, you don't need apps."
conformity,Disappointed,I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t able to watch anything. It kept buffering. Seems to be a constant problem with Amazon. I hope they can improve their streaming. I switched to Apple TV and it worked just fine so itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not my internet connection.
benevolence,Not usable,Wouldn't show games I wan't
hedonism,Pretty bad. Watched football on it and it buffered ...,"Pretty bad.  Watched football on it and it buffered constantly.  CBS streaming infrastructure is not yet ready for prime-time.  I imagine it would work fine for casual viewing, but not for events like football where everyone tunes in a the same time."
hedonism,Constantly buffering,Constantly buffering - this is the only app of all the sports apps that has this issue (I also have Fox Sports Go and WatchESPN).You can watch games but be prepared to reload the game in 5-10 minute intervals because it buffers for no reason.

benevolence,garbage,didn't  work
benevolence,Worthless for those who have cut the cable,"For those of us who have cut the cable (or dish) and gotten the Fire TV, this app is worthless. It would have been nice to watch the main NBC channel during the Olympics, but not even that seems to be possible."
conformity,Horrible App - Buffers or Crashes Often,"This app routinely crashes and it seems like when there are more people accessing it during the evenings it has to buffer or crashes.  Come on NBC, you paid tons of money to cover the Olympics ans you can't handle it!"
benevolence,Useless unless you have cable/satellite subscription,Completely useless unless you have a cable/satellite subscription.  If I had that why would I download this app?  We don't have cable or satellite TV that is why we use Prime.  It is free so I am not out any money but if I had cable or satellite I could watch NBC sports through my provider.
conformity,Very disappointed! could not use this app because I do ..,"Very disappointed! could not use this app because I do not have a paid TV subscription. I shut off my TV subscription and went to internet only because I was tired of the high prices. I am paying for internet and paying for Amazon Prime, this should qualify me to use this app"
benevolence,"No cable, app useless",I downloaded the app to watch a live game. I don't have cable. NBC does not come in even locally with my antenna. To use the app you must log into your cable provider. If I had cable... I wouldn't need the dang app!! It is useless on its own.

hedonism,Terrible quality,Too many commercials and they pick and choose what you can watch.

hedonism,Worst app of the major networks..,App is ALWAYS buffering..
benevolence,One Star,"Don't have cable, so wouldn't work."
conformity,Horrible,I would say the app works perfect but it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. My boyfriend and I were watching an intense football game the other night and it just stopped working on us. Eventually it got to the point where it wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t reload either and we couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t finish watching the game or anything else on the app either. Very disappointed.
hedonism,Frustrating,Must have a cable provider....  I dont have one so i cant sign on!
hedonism,Lots of lag,Works well about half the time if that. I dealt with a lot of lag during streams and it was quite annoying to deal with.
hedonism,Poor performance overall,"Lots of options, but the app itself is quite terrible. Quality is poor. Lots of buffering and freezing.I have 60mbsp down so would think bandwidth isn't a problem. If worked well app would be great."
benevolence,Never works,Such a head ache.  Not user friendly never works .  Uninstalled
hedonism,Terrible app,"We downloaded the app with hopes of getting a better Olympic viewing experience! After spending several minutes with the app buffering, rebooting, etc. We switched to another online service. I have attempted to watch other items with zero success"

hedonism,Too much buffering,So much buffering that it was impossible to watch.
conformity,Terrible,This app is terrible.  I pay for nbc gold and even since they did away with the nbc gold app it will no longer let me login to nbc gold on my tv or fire stick. I am able to log on on my phone but even then the streaming quality is terrible.
conformity,A Great Disappointment,"The first time I went to use the application in my KODI device, I realized that I had to pay for just about every single sport I had ny interest in. This is *not* what I had hoped for and expected. Very disappointing."
benevolence,Wast of time,Don't bother it has nothing to offer

benevolence,Useless,Useless app
hedonism,Lots of buffering. Very slow.,I used this app to watch the super bowl. It continued to buffer and by half time I was about 10 minutes behind. I eventually turned it off. While watching other  apps that evening they werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t doing the same so it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the connection.
conformity,Disappointing,When the amazon app purchase came through I thought it meant I had access through Amazon - didn't know I still needed cable to stream.  What's the point of downloading the app through my fire stick if that's the case?
conformity,Frustrated not being able to track the Tour de France.,Being assigned in Germany and wanting to watch the Tour de France. I found it disappointing that I couldn't track the Tour via NBC Sports.

hedonism,Three Stars,lots of commercials
conformity,Very disappointed in it,Used it to watch the SuperBowl. It kept buffering and delayed the game.  At times when it finally stopped buffering the program stopped playing in HD.  Very disappointed in it.  I finally stopped using the app and watched the program from a local station.
conformity,Doesn't Work with Antenna TV,We cut the cord several months ago.  Husband was going to use this to watch games but it only works if you have a cable provider.  Disappointing.
hedonism,Worthless,Super glitchy.  Couldn't even make it through single drive without glitching out. My internet service is fast and other apps work great.
hedonism,frustrating.,"Downloaded this app so I could watch the Superbowl and then ""This is Us"" right afterwards.  It kept coming in and out during the game saying, ""Coverage will return momentarily"", so I missed pieces of the game as well as a few of the funnier commercials.  And then it kept buffering during ""This Is Us"" which was quite frustrating."
benevolence,One Star,Didn't work for me
hedonism,Poor quality,"Watched the 45 minute free preview and it was slow, choppy and frozen most of the time. Needless to say I'm not purchasing this app."
hedonism,Hate NBC Sports Network,slow
hedonism,One Star,I'm sure the broadcast is great - I just couldn't get it to work on FIRE tv.  Frustrating!
hedonism,Too much buffering,"When it worked, it worked well. However, too many times the channel would stop playing (buffering or a message appeared stating channel to resume soon). Very annoying! If that issue can be fixed, the rating would go to 5 stars."
hedonism,WORST APP EVER,"This app is not only glitchy and horrible quality, but after I downloaded it, MY ENTIRE FIRE TV FROZE UP AND IS COMPLETELY UNUSABLE. zero stars, very upset. do not download this piece of garbage. come on NBC get your stuff together!"
conformity,Seriously disappointing in terms of content.,Seriously disappointing in terms of content. Only a small few sports events are available and most just are highlights. Considering that the only way you can get this is if you have one of the cooperating or associate cable companies.
conformity,Extremely disappointed with their product,I tried getting the NBC Sports app along with the NBC premier league gold package this past weekend and NBC had extreme technical difficulties and nothing was working as well as the fact that they weren't responsive in trying to contact them over the issue.  Extremely disappointed with their product.
conformity,One Star,Disconnected Olympics many times said I wasent a valid customer.
benevolence,Don't waste time,Did not work for me at all but it works on the phone
conformity,Now What?,I downloaded this APP with ease but I can't seem to be able to use it because it requires a TV provider. Apparently Amazon Fire Stick is not a TV provider.
benevolence,DidnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work,CouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make it work
benevolence,big Rip Off!,Such a big Rip Off!  Fire TV promised Olympic coverage on NBC but what a giant rip off!  Promises and no delivery!  I had to buy an antennae and watch my local channel. How about 0 stars!
benevolence,Worthless,I had 10 free minutes to decide if I wanted to subscribe. All ten minutes we're ads. No thanks. Awful!
hedonism,Two Stars,Bad stream quality with many freezes.  No other app on my Firestick has this problem.
benevolence,One Star,Worthless.
conformity,Not what I expected,I picked up nbc sports to watch the Indy 500 only to find out I had to have a service provider. I wish I knew this before I subscribed to nbc. Now I have to figure out how to unsubscribe to nbc.

conformity,Not what you think!,My impression was that I would be able to watch the Olympics through this app because I am an Amazon Prime member. Turns out I would have to buy NBC as a service through my cable provider. Not what I was expecting.

conformity,Don't waste your time,"I could only watch clips, not the live coverage. Don't waste your time."
benevolence,Don't waste your time.,"This app is crap. Trust the reviews, it is useless."
benevolence,absolutely worthless.,This app doesn't work and it hasn't worked for at least a month now. You just consistently get an error message and the app won't load. If I could give it 0 stars across the board I would.
benevolence,but I guess my FireTV is useless now for that,"Doesn't work with Charter Spectrum.  BOOOOOOO.  I really wanted to watch the Olympics with this thing, but I guess my FireTV is useless now for that."
hedonism,Too much lag time,"Overall it's fine. However, there is a definite lag time. So if you don't mind 1+ minutes behind no big deal."
hedonism,N/a,Not interested
conformity,Disappointed.,It's clunky to find things - not organized well. Wanted to see Olympic coverage by sport and there are over 500 clips that start with the oldest (pre-Olympics) - it would take waaaaay to much time to find what I really wanted to watch. Disappointed.
conformity,One Star,Terrible! Nothing was on!
benevolence,your app is GARBAGE!,"So, I downloaded this, got the code it needed, entered it in (3 times was a charm) and it STILL never worked!  I don't have time for non-user friendly apps.  Already deleted it.  NBC, your app is GARBAGE!"

hedonism,Worst Live Streaming experience EVER!!!,"worst live streaming experience EVER!!!  The app kept closing, freezing, buffering, and then when it would finally play, it would play on a loop of the same 2 minutes....missed pretty much the entire football game.  So frustrating."

achievement,Three Stars,The app feels clunky and unresponsive
achievement,Terrible interface,This app no longer holds replays on Fire sticks. You can only watch certain live streams on a computer now. Its interface got so terrible that I won't consider giving them my money for full access.

hedonism,frustrating,"UGH!! This is so frustrating. I have a cable provider, charter spectrum, and it is not compatible with this app!!

benevolence,One Star,junk
conformity,Do not like,"Not what I thought it was, want to cancel"

hedonism,Unwatchable,"Incredibly glitchy. Game pauses every 15 seconds, then jumps back 20 seconds, and then skips ahead. It jumps around so much I have no idea if I missed a play, or 5. So far behind other sports apps, I wonder how much effort has actually gone into this one."

benevolence,DRAGS!,"I found this APP a waste of time, it would cause my system to drag or hang up. I own and iPhone and have mirrored my phone to TV before via the Apple Device and never had a problem. This APP id not anywhere close to using and Apple device to mirror my phone. I had to delete the APP it was pointless to own. It just didn't work for me."
hedonism,Sub-par mirroring app,"A couple of issues with this app. First, it doesnâ€™t allow sound from the device being mirrored. So when I play something from my phone and mirror it to my tv, the sound comes from the phone... kind of annoying. The other big issue is that it will mirror for about an hour of playtime, then shuts down and you have to open your app again to being replaying. I wouldnâ€™t have bought it had I know about these issues."
achievement,I want my money back,"Installed this on my phone and for the life of me, Couldn't get it to work.  I am consider very tech savvy and I honest think this is a badly made program... I want my money back... Do NOT buy this..."

conformity,This was a waste of time,"This is the first Amazon App that I have been disappointed in which leads me to believe there is a ""pay"" app through Amazon that is much better.  We didn't have time to search for another product as we were trying to watch a high school play off game that was underway.  We finally just used the internet to access the game."
hedonism,Itâ€™s been deleted.,Your screen image was interrupted every 15-30 seconds with an add asking you to upgrade to a different product to get rid of the ads.  Very irritating. And it kept freezing.  Not cool.
hedonism,Not a great app - the mirroring doesn't work well,Tried mirroring some videos from my phone to my TV...it just didn't work well. Very poor picture quality and lots of lag. Wouldn't suggest it.
hedonism,Itâ€™s useless.,"I deleted it and want my money back. Itâ€™s completely impractical because thereâ€™s no sound, it lags and the picture Is much too small, media is unwatchable."
hedonism,"Mirrors screen, but video is poor quality and slow","It is easy use this app with your TV, but the video streaming quality is poor. I couldn't use it for the purpose I wanted, so I deleted the app."
hedonism,Not worth your time,"Very easy to use but if you are not paying for pro the picture quality sucks. It lags, the screen froze, and they have commercials every like 30 seconds. I deleted it."
conformity,This product is very BAD!!!,It does not work!  Please send it back to the software develops to re-create. Please do NOT release something to the market when it is NOT ready. I am very disappointed with the Amazon product... shame on you

hedonism,Waste of money,It was a little difficult to set up. It starts to mirror and after a few minutes freezes and just stops. Then hassle to get it going again and does the same thing. Waste of money!!!

universalism,Finally something that works with a Kindle,"Thank you! Thank you! Thank you Hammermill. After frustratingly futzing with the Epson printer plugin for the last hour, I found your app and it works for my Epson WF 7610 and my Kindle HD 10. In appreciation, I will buy your paper from now on."
self direction,Works! Found my Epson and printed the pages I needed.,Something came up while on my Kindle Fire's web connection that I wanted to print off. Unfortunately I didn't have a print button so I backed out and went to the app store and found this one. I use Hammermill copy paper so I thought the app would be fine. It is and I had no problems with it doing a wireless check for my printer and sending the web page to the printer.
self direction,FINALLY!,"I FINALLY found an app that will easily print PDF's on my Kindle Fire. I was not able to get my Epson app with plug-in to even work. Anyway, thank you Hammermil for creating such a thourough, easy to install and easy to use app!"
universalism,FANTASTC,"I've got an HP C5500 all-in-one printer that connects via Bluetooth and USB to my laptop. After checking the reviews for various print apps for my Kindle Fire I decided to try this one. For me it appears to work flawlessly via Bluetooth. For testing I've printed a photo and a PDF document with no problems. Printing a test document from Office Suite was a bit more involved than just selecting 'print' since you also have to 'print' from the Hammermill application to get your output but it's not bad.I have many years of professional experience with computers and found nothing unexpected or difficult. I did have to download the appropriate driver for my printer and then some rendering software prior to printing my test document. To me, the prompts for doing this were straightforward and easy to follow. The printing setup was the easiest I've seen for setting up the configuration options for my printer. Much more straightforward than all the steps needed for changing settings from my laptop with the printer manufacturer's driver.I suppose someone as technophobic as my wife would have some difficulty but setting up printing isn't exactly for the faint of heart with all the possibilities of today's printers but this software makes it simple. A little bit of study and understanding of the info on the screens is needed for the uninitiated. A 'read me' document or menu choice for the novice wouldn't hurt."
self direction,Will not print to some Canon models,I thought this was finally going to be a great printing app for my kindle fire. It installed easy and picked up my Canon Wifi right away. Unfortunately it wouldn't print. It kept saying &#34;broken pipe&#34;.  I have a Canon MX452 and noticed the driver only says Canon mx45. There is no mx452 option:(
self direction,Very Happy I Got This App,"I was skeptical. I loaded the app, and then didn't do anything with it, after printing the test page to confirm the connection. A couple nights later, I was laying in bed, and thought I should perhaps try and print something. I set up a ""lets test this printer app"". Clicked print. Waited, and heard the printer come to life, and went to look. I was amazed. Whether you get this for free, or decide to purchase, it will work for you very much as described.I am using a wireless Brother printer, and a Samsung Galaxy S-5 phone."
power,Did not work,"Could not get my Fire 10.8"" tablet to print with this app.  I even called Amazon help.  They took control of my tablet and tried for 20 min. to get the app. to work.  They do not know what is wrong."
power,Best Print App So Far,"I use this app to print from Kindle Fire HD to Canon Pixma MG6220. This app has many functions that lets me have greater control over printing compared to other apps such as ""PrinterShare Mobile Print"". Here is the list of ""Print Hammermill"" functions that I like:1) Printing source selection from files, image gallery, web pages, Google Drive, Gmail, Email, contacts, calendar, Facebook, Box, Dropbox, OneDrive, Evernote, and SugarSync2) Multi-image-select function allows batch printing3) Printer options for paper size, printout mode (normal, grayscale, or photo), duplex mode (short edge, or long edge)4) Large, detailed print preview5) Document options for picture size (original, fit to page, 3 1/2 x 5, 4 x 6, 5 x 7, 8 x 10), page orientation, alignment (center or top left)6) Printing protocol (LPD, IPP, BJNP, or WRPT) -- This is VERY USEFUL!!I've tried other printing apps (Easy Cloud Print, Cloud Print, Pixma Print, Canon Print Service, PrintShare Mobile Print), and I think this app is the best one for me!!"
self direction,Not What We Expected,They wanted me to pay for something that worked and was dependable. No thanks. I thought we could get this app for free. Never worked without asking for more.
self direction,Great app!,"I found this app when I needed to replace my PrintBot app when it stopped working, and I wish I had found the Hammermill app at the very beginning. Setup is easy if it can find your printer. It doesn't locate all Wi-Fi printers, but kudos for having a manual setup option. The printing itself is easy, and allows you to see previews. I like other ability to print both in apps and from the print app proper. The interface is nice and professional, and the Hammermill adverts are not irritating. I appreciate the options of only printing certain pages or choosing to print in black and white or color. It felt more like printing from my laptop than from the Kindle. l would like to see an option to change print quality, especially for photos, but all in all, this is one of the best print apps out there."
universalism,Determination and read instructions carefully.,It is helping me print using my kindle fire 8. Since my printer is not wireless I had a little trouble understanding and getting connected. Could not have been able to print without this app.
self direction,I want app thay,I thought it says the hap was free but they want me to pay 4.99

self direction,This is great and was so easy to set up,"This is great and was so easy to set up!! I am not tech savey so if I can do it so can u. Never thought I could use a Kindle to print.  Again great app,and for free how can u go wrong!!!"
power,Love this app.,"Great product, allows more control of the print outcome vs. others I've tried. I would recommend this product to anyone. AWESOME."
universalism,loading it,"I think this is a great app.  I have a kindle and I am very pleased with it, a time saver as well.  I placed an online order and saved the confirmation to my bookmarks. I was curious as to how to print that conformation page and played around trying to figure just how to do that.  I looked all over the menu page of the app and tapped on several of the listed and nothing led me to what I needed.  I went back to my bookmarks and hit the share button and it gave me a list of who I wanted to share with and tapped the Print Hammermil.  It printed it  just fine, no problems at all.  I was hoping there was an app of this nature would come along.  I not a teckie but I recommend this app.  People friendly not difficult at all to use."
self direction,The Hammermill app is working for me beautifully.,"I downloaded this app in July of 2014 and could never get it to work with my Canon MP810 and my Kindle, via Bluetooth. After replacing my 8-year-old Canon with a Canon Maxify 2020 this week, I thought I'd try again. I had to use Hammermill's generic drivers, but the app found my new Canon immediately and I can now print from my 2nd Gen Kindle Fire. If you have a 2nd Gen Kindle Fire and a Canon printer, don't bother with the Canon Print Plug-in, which is only compatible with 3rd Gen and later. The Hammermill app is working for me beautifully."
self direction,One Star,App will not download after 5 attempts and no actionable clue as to why
power,sweet,"Prints on any network. Easy to navigate. I had printed on an Iphone and the controls are similar. One additional step, just pick the local workgroup, no biggie, I recommend it."

power,There must be something better,"This app wanted access to every conceivable part of my phone. Network is fine. Boot logs, status and identity and more is not.I printed what I needed and deleted it.Shame on the developers.The star is because it did print a file. But if I could give it zero, I would."
self direction,It worked.,When the other app did not work with my Brother printer this one did. Success = Satisfaction.
power,permission,Do they really need to be able to access and control everything on my phone? I will not give permission for everything!
universalism,Doesn't work for Pixima MX922...,"Re: Canon PIXIMA MX922, having trouble understanding why this app doesn't work in my Kindle. Keeps telling me to turn off Wi-Fi and connect a printer cable to the computer. Well the printer will not allow both Wi-Fi to be on and to use the cable. Wi-Fi is most important so had no choice but to discard this app. Sad."
self direction,It's not working.,I thought this would be cool.  It does take up space in my memory. But it doesn't print.
self direction,Unexpected!,Never thought it would work so well!  Amazing!  And it's a free product!
security,No good at all....,Looks good does nothing...yahoo has a site safety warning on it!!
self direction,Great app,"I found a manual for my bread maker and needed to print it out. I thought for a few minutes, then knew I needed some app for me to print out.I downloaded it, then it found my Epson workforce 545, and my Canon . I used the Epson printer and was able to print it out.I am going to load this in all my tablets I have. This app is simply the easiest to use, I love it."
security,Could be good Kindle Fire print aid if it worked with GMAIL email,"Was very happy to add print capability to my Kindle Fire HD, but disappointed that it only worked with my AOL email account.  My more current GMAIL account kept rejecting the application as asecurity risk."
self direction,Better than Eprint,Really like the features that are offered.  Only used a couple of times so far and it is far better than e-print.  Looking forward to using it more often and exploring the many features it offers. Definitely would recommend it to my friends.
self direction,useless,This app didn't work. It wouldn't print anything. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I thought it was a waste of time.
stimulation,Five Stars,It works on my Fire Kindle which is a challenge in itself.
self direction,One Star,Creating docs no
stimulation,So far so good,I'm still trying different files to see what i can do as opposed to Microsoft Office I had on my PC. Working a file from a android style tablet has many challenges.
self direction,Don't download unless you want to pay $5 a month to use it,I thought I had found a decent word processing app for my kindle....wrong.  Right up until I wanted to print everything was great.  Easy to use and looked a lot like Microsoft word.  I go to print and of course I can't because I need to have a subscription for their premium service.  What a joke.
self direction,"Nice app, works ok for free.","Ok app for free. Works as expected for a free app. There are some problems, but all in all so far I have not had any major issues. Running on a Kindle Fire, with multiple different documents transferred over from the old one via Bluetooth. The app pickup those and read them fine. So for What I wanted it is working. I have copied and pasted a few things onto documents without issues. I have not up graded yet, but I may later if it continues to work this well. Only reason I have it 3 stars is because of the fact I had to sign into Facebook to continue using it and it continues to ask me to up grade. Some actions are just obnoxious."
self direction,Pointless to have,"If I could I wouldn't give it any stars. downloaded this app for creating a resume. It will not let me save it to my documents, therefore I am not allowed to attach it to anything. If I want to transfer it to where I need it I have to pay a fee. A monthly subscription. Not worth getting if you can't even attach your documents or send them."
self direction,Good free download,"This is a free app that gives your tablet, Kindle etc good basic word processing ability. I find it to be a good app to take notes when I am traveling. And creating simple documents. Once you have the free app you also have the option to get the premium package for a monthly fee. I haven't found that it necessary to get the premium package yet but am pleased that I have the option to upgrade. I would recommend this app."
self direction,Unuseable,Loved this app and thought it was perfect for use with my tablet until I tried to print a document!  Then there was a $4 charge per month just to be able to print!  Not exactly a free app.  So disappointed.Ã°??Â¢
universalism,Best for Fire,"The best office app for Fire tablets, including the best and easiest to use PDF reader.The word processor and spreadsheet work best for display and simple entry/editing due to the nature of tablet computing."
self direction,Doesn't let you share docs,"Sure it has a share button, but I'm a book editor, and I work for a publisher. I also freelance. I need to get both my publisher and my clients CLEAN, easy to open document attachments. So, I tapped the *send as attachment* button and ZOOOM! Away went a white screen that said, well, who knows what because it just whipped up off the top of my screen.So I thought, okay...I'll just send them a link.I thought I'd send it to myself first to see how easy this would be for my clients to use.So, I tap the appropriate button to send it to myself and get to preview before it sends. I figured I would click the link rather than waiting, and do you know what happens instead of sending a link to my document to my boss and my client?They are taken to THIS PAGE TO DOWNLOAD THE APP!!!This ANGERS ME TO NO END! I'm trying to use this as a PROFESSIONAL BUSINESS TOOL & THE COMPANY IS USING ME TO PASS THE WORD ABOUT THEIR PRODUCT?And the kicker is...the people I'm sending the document to use LAPTOPS or DESKTOPS and have no use for this!I didn't see my document attached, or a link to it, in the email, either. The ONLY THING there was a link to the landing page to download this app!I DID have some nice things to say about it - like, it's the only APP I found that lets me track changed (which my industry uses constantly), but what good is it if I can't get the doc back to my boss or client after it's completed? I don't get paid. In fact, I could get FIRED! And LOSE clients for sending them SPAM.THANKS A LOT MOBI!"
self direction,A  Winner!,This app is a beautiful thing.  Even I was able to use it first time out. (69 years old and no tech whiz.)  Thanks for creating it.
power,Awesome!,"I have this Kindle for 2 years now . And I really needed to find ways for it to be helpful in my career status. I really needed help. I'm use to having word on my computer. Without knowing which apps to choose, I was confused I couldn't understand a way to help me. Low and behold, I created an email with Outlook and my kindle became so familiar to me. Everything is coming together with this wonderful app. I so new to it. So I have an lot of learning to do with it. Thank you for developing this usuable app for the working world and home life. I will add more later."
self direction,not worth your time,"This app starts awesome I wanted a way to capture my thoughts while on the go, I started a new d o document and it was great. Until I went to add to it the next day, I had to download another app in order to even open the document, then it kept coming up with errors because the default font isn't available in the free app"
security,OK but the disabled features in the free version can be very annoying,"Specifically you cannot print a doc and more specifically the User Manual pdf is in a witness protection program - you can only read it on your device.  It's not available on the Internet.  In 2014? Really?  You can't download it from their web site? Sooo 20th Century.That said, the free version 7.5 DOES indeed edit M$Word docs despite all the negative reviews here.  Since I'm running it on a Galaxy 5 smartpnone not a tablet, I haven't tried an Excel or PPT file.  8-)"
power,It's OK,"I'm not real happy with the way the controls work.  Sometimes the background color goes right over the controls, and you have no alternative but to exit.  Also, I still don't know what the dropper is for.  It's kind of fun to use, and not too hard once you get going."
self direction,disappointing,"This app allows for a test drive which runs smoothly and I loved it in the run but once I downloaded it I was unable to even draw all I could do was upload images and it kept on trying to save which I clicked ""not save"" and it would open up to choosing a pic??? Very frustrating especially since I couldn't even get a line to show up....please fix for kindle fire,Thank you"
power,BORING!,It's so boring!  Hard to control! I absolutely hate it!  Looks easy but not! I Would NOT Recommend Getting it!!
self direction,Sketch Guru,Not at all what I thought. I wanted to use this to learn to draw. Not going to happen. I will be deleting this one.
power,trouble using,I was unable to sketch anything very well.  I didn't feel I had near good enough control of the wand.
self direction,Children friendly,I downloaded this for my 10 year old and he loves it and can easily navigate the app independently
self direction,It so good I love it,It is super good I thought at first it didn't work and I tried it it work and I only got on it cause my friend asked me to and I was surprised it actually worked this app is the best.
self direction,Good,Skype in action :-)looking good and very handy while using with my new kindlefire HD. Still improvements required for video chatting in 2g networks for other devices.
power,Horrible Update,"Skype, for Kindle hd, was okay before recent update.  After update, multi-tasking is non existent, there is no volume control and calls constantly drop.  I wish there was an option to go back to the previous update.  Please stop back tracking, Skype, and fix these issues."
self direction,would give zero stars if I could.,"The worst app I have. Every time, and I mean every time, I get an incoming call Skype crashes! And it wouldn't even surprise me if my Skype crashes during a call. If it crashes while turning on. If it is not reactive at all when I try to call someone. Like there isn't even a ring tone when I call someone do I sit there in awkward silence wondering if I pressed the call button and suddenly my friends voice is on the other side just.... sudden! Or if I am still seeing no reaction once I press the call button I press it twice and then it non stop calls my friend no matter how I try to hang up, I have to turn off my kindle to get it to stop calling!If it aren't for necessity, it would never come back on my kindle I hate this thing so much"
self direction,...,Disappointed. I'd like to know why it is saying I have 20 free remaining video messages left? I thought Skype to Skype video messages were a;ways free?
self direction,Kindle Fire HD 8.9- AWFUL,"I have never had problems with Skype until using this app. Random shut downs on mine and my husband's end (ipad 2), freezing, and blackout/muted moments. I was excited to be able to talk to my husband who is over seas but Skype makes it so frustraing and at times impossible to video or even simply to voice chat. I thought maybe it was the distance but have tried local with just as many problems. I wish there was a solid alternative."
self direction,I wish I could give it less than one star.,"I bought two Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" 32G tablets for my husband and I for Christmas presents.  He is a marine, I thought that for his deployment this would be great for entertainment and communication.  This app has worked correctly once.  Just one single time.  The speakers stopped putting out what he was saying, the screen freezes, calls are ""busy"" over and over again (even though we confirmed the other person is not making a call).  I'll be deleting this App and might try to re-download, but I don't have much faith.This is separate from the Skype review - but I'm incredibly disappointed with my Kindle over all.  It seems that most things don't work - except for things eligible for purchase off of Amazon.  I am an avid PC/Android user - and I hate to say it - but I wish I had just bought an IPAD."
self direction,please fix it!,"This app needs serious work. It should not only work for certain devices, it's not fair! I have the new kindle fire HDX 7&#34; and I very disappointed. The person I call can see me fine but I can't see her. The video and the audio are not in sync with each other so as I talk the action follows10 seconds  later. It's annoying. Please fix this app. I rather just have the Google play store apps"
power,please for the love of god don't use this app.,"I've had my kindle fire hd for around a year now and the skype app has always been terrible. It crashes a lot for no reason and the volume controls are ridiculous. With every update it gets worse and the most recent one is a train wreck. Constantly crashing and freezing, webcam function freezese and doesn't work. It's beyond frustrating."
self direction,skype connection,It was so hard to access nowadays to skype thru my kindle fire hd please make a necessary action for this. The reason why i bought this tablet because i saw their ads on tv that skype is accessible on this tablet thanks
self direction,Insufficient funds?,I'm trying to get a hold of my best friend in the middle east and I keep getting an insufficient funds message on kindle HDX. I thought Skype was free.
power,Skype/useless,"I got a kindle to take travelling with me, partly to use Skype to keep in touch with home. All worked brilliantly till an automatic up date, supposedly making Skype better for the tablet, downloaded it's self. I've paid to have a number on Skype and do use credit to make some calls and send texts, but I've found that being a paying customer means nothing to Skype, I am evidently worthless to them.  It was near impossible to contact anyone at Skype, it's really hard to get to the point that you can actually communicate with someone and when I finally did they weren't helpful at all.  So I got in touch with Amazon, they were great and gave me a way to overcome the problems I've been having. Albeit a temporary fix.The problems I've had have included, not being able to sign in, the control panel disappearing so I cannot sign in or out (once signed out automatically there was no way to sign back in), see what credit I have or access my profile. Losing all records of any texts that I have sent and paid for. The programme constantly crashes.Having got home from travelling I have again contacted Skype to try and resolve the problem.  Several emails have been exchanged, they have collected data from me about the problem and now have closed the case without having resolved the problem at all. I have lost money because of the problems I've had, directly from my Skype credit, I shall never see that again.  Skype is a disgrace, if anything goes wrong with the programme they are useless, it appears to be a waste of time contacting them, they don't understand their own product."

self direction,Update Ruined Skype,"Since Skype has been updated I've faced a bunch of problems. One problem is that the volume is high, it doesn't matter if I put the volume on zero I can still hear the person on the other line loudly. Another problem that I have is that as soon as you click on the app it signs in automatically. If someone was to click on my Skype they would be able to access my messages and contacts immediately.  I want my privacy. Another problem is that it continuously crashes for no apparent reason. One minutes it's working and the next it's sending you a message that says ""Skype is not responding would you like to close it"" if you say yes it closes and if you don't the message will continue to pop up. Before the update I also noticed that Skype would just hang up my calls and I thought it was my internet connection but after reading numerous reviews I realize that I'm not the only one with this problem. Skype needs to be fixed immediately. The company should fix all the glitches before putting it back in the Appstore."
self direction,Great App!,Works perfectly. You can chat see your other friends and family. Now I can chat with my sister and uncles. The kindle fire VS is great. I'm so glad. If you were having second thoughts about getting it. Then yes you should.definitely get it.
power,unbelievably bad update,"If you have an older version of Skype, keep it. The newer version/update is absolutely awful. No way to control the volume, and it constantly crashes. I've written to Amazon, but they continue to make it available in prominent position in their app store. DON'T DOWNLOAD IT!"
stimulation,Great App,"At first I had a little trouble getting use to it, but then--WOW! It's fast, and lets me send my whole message. I am technology challenged, so thank you for this."
self direction,Not acceptable for voice calls.on Kindle.,"I was looking for a complete communications app. This is OK for text, but totally unacceptable for voice on the Kindle Fire as the volume is too low to be usable. Initially, I thought the Kindle (Fire HD8, 7th gen) was defective, but found that the volume is fine on all other apps"
self direction,Useless,"I thought this would be great but no, it doesn't bring up all my contacts, just 2?? And when I tried to text one of these people it just didn't work.Not fit for purpose."
self direction,I love it,"I liked it, though it was kinda confusing for me at least. I thought it was really cool, and I think you guys should try it. and if you don't like it then that's just your opinion and this is mine so.....listen to me if you want but you don't have too.:)"
self direction,Won't load,So the new update came and I thought it was gonna be good but it will not load
security,It works!,"I was surprised but it does work.  I havent listed my contacts in it, but the sms works well .  Need to check thesecurity on it just to be sure, but so far so good.  I have a phone number. 'I'll keep you updated."
self direction,Three Stars,Not wht I thought
self direction,MPsizzle,This app is great thank you for creating it and helping me reach my friends.
self direction,awesome,I thought this app was a scam at first but it works it's mush better than a phone except it's not portable it works like a phone you can call and text and face time get it now.
universalism,App works pretty good,"Over all, the app works pretty good. Sometimes it has a problem understanding what you say. I'm using it on a Kindle Fire HDX."
self direction,easy to follow,"choosing a language - has a good mix; point and peck-scrambles placement of answers; no typing (misspelling) involved; only language immersion practiced with the right level of repetition without becoming ""annoying/frustrating"""
self direction,Good App,"I like the app. It was more lessons than I thought I would get with a free app. I am partial to Rosetta Stone having used it before but i do believe it is a good program. But of course they put hard sell on you via e-mail for the full version. But hey, isn't that part of the reason they're offering a free app?"
stimulation,I love the app on Rosetta stone,"I love the app on Rosetta stone, it challenges you. I'm of Hispanic decent so it's easy but a little challenging., without the pictures it would be harder. The app is great."
self direction,I overestimated this terribly.,"This app runs like crap on my kindle. I already use 'Duolingo' and 'Memrise' with 'Itranslate' to supplement my vocabulary, but I thought I'd give it a go because of its popularity. It wasn't worth it. It's big, and very slow. I spent more time looking at a black loading screen than I did actually learning. If you want an app that will teach you a language, I suggest the ones I mentioned above. They're similar in style, but each a bit different to cater to different learning styles, and both are WAAAAY better than Rosetta stone. Memrise in particular is pretty awesome, because it offers courses on tons of subjects, not just language. Don't waste your time with Rosetta. Es nicht sehr gut."
self direction,Wasn't what I thought!,"Wasn't what I thought! A lot of hidden charges. That's about it, other than who is really benefiting here not I."
universalism,I love it!,"It may be difficult starting out with a new language. I downloaded this to learn Korean a language I did not know at all and I feel like I'm getting the hang of it a little bit. But it is coming along. For a language I was familiar with, Spanish, it was a breeze but a lot easier to understand. Overall I love the app! I have no problems with it understanding what I am saying."
self direction,awesome,When I started Rosetta Stone I thought it was going to be like other experiences where it would take a long time. To my surprise I'm almost done with the first lesson and I just started today. Rosetta Stone is the fastest way to learn a language.
self direction,Yo quiedro habla en espanol....,Make sure you use the online offer...it will expire after 6 months. I thought I could save it until I was ready. Go all in or don't buy it.The at home section is easy to use so if you apply the time you will learn. Not sure how the application online would go - was nervous about that part.
self direction,My Spanish for dummies,So far I have not had as much opportunity as I thought I would to use the program it's getting three stars because what I've listen to so far is good.
stimulation,articulation plurals singles and gender proper pronunciation.,Great way to challenge you to know the difference between genders and single or plural! And proper pronunciation and enunciation and articulation.
self direction,"enjoy, but somewhat pricey","We have the desktop Rosetta, & added the Kindle & phone app recently. We paid $25 for three months' use of the app. I love practicing my French on my Kindle. I would have thought this would have been included in the price of the desktop version. It is pricey, but it's worth it at this point. I'll see later on if I'll want to continue paying for the app."
universalism,Five Stars,"Uplifting, positive and informative, true to human nature. Thanks TED"
self direction,Five Stars,Many brief thought provoking presentations.great app

power,Stellar way to practice!,"I love how it pushes me to learn,  but let's me control it. Couldn't be better!"
stimulation,Great for starting out a new language,I wanted to get some foundation before I went into college classes next semester which means I have no background at all in the language and still have found the lessons easy to follow and learn with enough challenge you really feel like you are picking something up.
stimulation,Great free app for learning a new language,First off it free so thats a big plus.  Two its a lot better than other language apps and you can challenge other friends which is a big motivator.
self direction,If You Want to Learn a Language Try....,You learn! It's easy and fun and you'll spend far more time on it than you planned or thought you would in individual sessions.
tradition,love this app!!!,"Awesome app!! Best online foreign language app ever and  best yet it's free!!! I have been using this app for a year and a half and I am already almost fluent. Though you cannot rely on this app alone to achieve fluency, it will provide an excellent foundation that you may use to launch you into other spanish media such as books, music, and movies. This app moved my life in a new direction, led to new friendships (multicultural), and more.  Ã‚Â¡Buena suerte!"
self direction,Love it!!!,It's so easy to use that I'm learning quicker than I thought I could.
self direction,It makes learning a language feel like a game,"I actually look forward to practicing, which something I never expected. I thought it would feel like a chore the whole time, but Duolingo mixes up the activities so that learning doesn't get stagnant or boring."
stimulation,Two Stars,"Not exactly educational, interesting novelty."
self direction,Difficult to access.,"Tried to access via the Tablet way. Perhaps my tablet - an earlier edition - is not sufficient to log on......Will try at a later date.In the interim, looks interesting, would really like to see the program in action."
self direction,Decent app for learning Spanish,"I love it. The app is free and I am learning how to pronounce  the words not just read and guess. To really learn the language, some practice every day is super important. I thought I would try this  instead of spending hundreds on other apps or courses out there."
stimulation,Five Stars,Absolutely wonderful! I am learning! I feel challenged! I am proud of my streak!
stimulation,Love it!,Easy to incorporate into day and fun to challenge friends.
power,Two Stars,was good except it seemed to take control and I did not like that feature
self direction,The best lanuage app out there,For a free app this language learner is awesome. My cousin told me about it when I asked him what he thought of that over priced one everyone has seen on TV but I will reframe from calling it by name. They also have an app but sadly Duolingo is much easier and friendlier to use. I've learned so much from this app already and cant wait to put some of it into practice. If you have ever wanted to learn a new language Duolingo is your best choice for apps.
self direction,Amazing app but a few languages should be added.,"Duolingo is an amazing app! At first I thought I was just wasting my time but now I look at it and a great USE of time. One thing I would add is the variety of languages. Maybe you should add Japanese, Korean, Chinese."
universalism,Nice,Easy to use and progress through the lessens. I need a little help understanding the different endings for pronouns and gender but in general this is really helpful.
self direction,I always wanted to learn another language but when my ...,"I always wanted to learn another language but when my French teacher said that I would never learn another language, I thought she might be right, until Duolingo. I'm only on level 10, but I'M ON LEVEL 10!!!. One day I hope that I can run into my French teacher and lecturer her in all the languages that I am learning!!! I should probably thank her for pushing me to prove her wrong!"
universalism,"A little lacking, but otherwise good.","I originally downloaded this app to help me brush up on my French, which is pretty rusty after 15 years of little to no use, and my Spanish, which is just a little rusty after a year of little to no use. I am somewhat pleased with this app. I don't like it as much as I like my French and Spanish classes, but as far as a language tutor, it's great. The only thing lacking in this app is that it doesn't explain the conjugations of verbs with respect to pronouns. For instance--and I'm going to use Spanish as an example here--it doesn't explain why the verb 'ser' gets conjugated to 'eres' when you say ""tu eres,"" or why it gets conjugated to 'somos' when you say, ""nosotros somos."" If it explained the process of conjugation for each language, that would make the app SO MUCH better and also help newbies have a fuller understanding of the language they are trying to learn. Anyone who doesn't know the first thing about other languages is going to think that this app is great, but if you are like me and you have had formal classes before, you will know that this app is seriously lacking. Formal classes give you the fundamental principles of the language to help you, and one of those fundamentals is learning conjugation so that you will not only understand what you're saying, but WHY you're saying it that way. I know this app isn't the same as a formal class, but if the developers are going to market it as an alternative to expensive formal classes, then they need to at least offer better teaching tools within the app."
self direction,Not for me...,"Not something IÃ¢??m really into. I thought theyÃ¢??d be more of what Food Network has, game shows , diners drive in and dives etc.It is a tutorial cooking channel."
self direction,Already deleted it,"The app just closes whenever I try to pic a chef. There's nowhere for me to log in to personalize my stuff. I thought it was a good recipe app but all I got was a box that says ""The kitchen has stopped"" whenever I try to do anything."
self direction,Ok app if you want to spend lots of time searching.,"This app is ok. I thought it would be fab but I have been a bit disappointed with it. I just want to be able to find good recipes easy to make. I don't feel picking a chef, and doing all that is necessary. It's a bit of a waste of time."
self direction,Have to pay for subscription,Why bother creating an app with pre-recorded contents that requires subscription. Youtube has a lot more pro cooking videos and they are free. Uninstalled!
self direction,license invalid error!,"Great app-Bad programmingOn a Galaxy Tab 2 7""The app generates an error message --- License Invalid, purchase app .Options on popup cancel or buy at google play.Does not recognise the Amazon licenseA worse programming error than I thought - THE WRONG POPUP FOR THE ERROR.Explaination: I typo my password creating the user on foodnetwork.com.

power,Good but laggy volume and pause wont work,The volume when i rec sounds choppy and i have parent controls on so i can only download this :(  also when i try to pause and end recording and watch video it doesn't pause in the vid. please fix both things please.
power,Its okay,It takes like a minute to load and every time I try to make a video on a game the controls go away so it would be nice if y'all four fix that.Thx
self direction,Avoid the CBS Sports app for now...(downloaded for superbowl 2016).,It was laggy. What I mean is that I ran it on my fire tv stick specifically to watch the superbowl and the pre-game stuff leading up to it. The audio was multiple seconds behind the video which made it difficult because entire sentences where spoke before I actually heard them.  I thought maybe if I restart that would clear it up. Sadly no. The app was bad enough I just went ahead and used my over the air antenna instead. I wanted this app to work well. But it did not. I cannot recommend it at this time as a result. I suggest steer clear of this application. It was made available for the superbowl and failed.
self direction,Two Stars,Was different than I thought it would be. Did not have any live games
self direction,"Great product, smooth transaction","Great product, smooth transaction"
self direction,WonÃ¢??t show games,"Unable to watch any games, thought it was something else."
power,"Stuttering commercials AND sometimes show, too.  Super-annoying","The show (The Good Fight) often stuttered (other shows did not so it wasn't a system-wide data transfer issue) and the commercials ALWAYS did.  Drove me nuts.  Their tech support could not solve the problem and higher-level support did not call back to help, as they said they would.  Plus, the Forward/Reverse/Play/Pause interface for this site with the Fire Stick is terrible.  I had a hard time controlling where I wanted to go, unlike any other service I've ever had.  WAY too complicated.  The whole experience was a giant headache.  Get it together, CBS."
self direction,great app,Just what I thought this app would . It gives me the scores and update of my favorite teams.  Thanks cbs.
self direction,That it doesnÃ¢??t have all the stopping and restarting during programming.,I thought getting it all signed up was confusing. IÃ¢??ve only had it three days. So far so good!!! We will see we got it mainly to follow Chicogo Cubs season. Tried others and discontinued because of all the stopping and starting.
self direction,Great TV,ItÃ¢??s great we get all the locals and cable channels we used to have at a fraction of the price. My husband gets his sports channels too. We have recording and cloud preferences too
self direction,Very disappointed that the live sports wasnÃ¢??t what we expected.,We tried fubo as our cable is no longer getting our favorite sports and tv shows. As football season is kicking off we thought this would be the answer. Very disappointed that the live sports wasnÃ¢??t what we expected.
self direction,Not what I wanted,The way it was advertised I thought I could stream out of market NFL but you cannot. Glad  only did the trial because it was not what I wanted at all.
tradition,Don't expect ease of Use,"We did not find this service at all easy to use and found it too difficult to navigate without the traditional remote.Also, the freezing of the video, randomly, throughout a show, was too annoying to ignore."
self direction,Works,Thought I could get football game not in my local lineup
self direction,fox sports,For my first try of this app I thought it was very good and I will use it more.

self direction,Live NFL football,thought I could watch live NFL football games great 
self direction,Worst app ever,"Worst app ever , why do I have to go find my phone or laptop to sign in every f***ing time I want to check in on the progress of a game ? I have 30 Mbps internet and still get stop and game action on my Fire tv."
self direction,One Star,Not what I thought it would be.
self direction,Very very glitchy,"App is incredibly glitchy. Watching live games is completely unreliable as it will constantly cut back to scenes that occurred about 10 seconds ago, and then jump right back to the live action. NBC really needs to update this app."
self direction,hope i dont get charged for this,tried to download the app but could not thought It would pick up off my wi fi but would never work just got to figure out how to cancel
self direction,but you have to get permission from your cable provider or codes or something stupid like that,"I thought I could watch a game from the day before, but you have to get permission from your cable provider or codes or something stupid like that.  Waste of time. If you want to watch 30 second clips of anything get this app. Why offer it if you can't watch anything?"
self direction,Why bother?,"Only works if you have cable or satellite TV.  There seems to be no way to pay for it independently.  If I had cable, I would not need this ..."
self direction,One Star,Didn't have the access I thought I did!

power,"Works great, just as advertised","Works great, just as advertised.  Installing APPS can be difficult, but likely the same for all such systems.  Video and audio quality is excellent.  FF or REW is a little slow and not easy to control."
self direction,like i thought I would,"I don't really watch this to much, like i thought I would."
self direction,This is false advertising... It would not ...,This is false advertising... It would not let me watch live events and only let you see clips of news broadcast of events that they told you ahead of time who won.  If i had a service subscriber i would not need this app..... Thats why i bought it to watch the Olympic's... thru netflix I thought.  I may ask for my credit card to be refunded for this usless app...
self direction,No free live sports,I thought it was going to give free live sports but it only let me view part of the game. Picture quality was great though.
self direction,Not perfect,"As reported previously, no audioNot a problem if you have a Bluetooth speakerHowever, as also reported, the video lags, creating image distortion and audio lag which is not a problem for short videos but would be hell if trying to view a movie or other lengthy videoOverall, mehIt did what I wanted"
self direction,Totally works,"Did a great job ,only setback was I thought the entire app was free and was a little surprised when I had to purchase the cleaner"
self direction,Great App,"Works well, really speeds up my kindle without creating any issues"
power,Good app but,This app does do what it says it will do. However I wish there was an option to buy the app to eliminate the adds and include options to better control when it runs.
security,Highly recommended,Good buy.......runs efficiently and restores confidence in safety of keeping my device clean from suspicious files
power,Process,Amazed at quickness of the process is to analyzed the status of the tablet. Pleased that when diagnosis is completed that I get a status report and can choose the next operation.?
security,It cleans garbage.,For the cost of is better than nothing. Prefer 360security but I guess it does not work on tablets.
security,Great App,Even paying the small price for the full version is worth every penny. Great protection for your Fire tablet. Yep it does make a difference in speed.
power,Worthless...waste of time to download,"After the app scanned my fire, it opened a screen to purchase the rest of the app, but even that didn't work.Does amazon have no interest in quality control on the apps from its store?"
power,Does not work.,"The two IP cameras are working well with MIPC App. I wanted something better. Since the tinyCam free app did not have the PTZ controls, I bought the tinyCam Pro. It does not work. It crashes after less than 1 minute saying it is unable to communicate with the camera. I have tried playing with all settings but no change. I made sure that the MIPC app was not running on the other phone, going so far as to turn off that phone, so there would be no interference.tinyCam PRO, in its current form (Dec 15, 2020) is a fundamentally unreliable product. It may have worked in some previous versions with some older ip cameras, but the current version does not work with current hardware. Don't waste your time or money."
security,Easy to use and good features for $3,"This turned my FireTV into a very quick and easy way for me to get a quick visual of mysecurity cameras. For the price it even has some features that could make it a dedicatedsecurity DVR if you have a NAS. I don't use those features, but they do show up. The ability to add a variety of cameras using everything from H264 to MPEG painlessly is worth $3."
power,Works great - easy to use,I had the FREE version and upgraded to be able to pan and tilt my cameras.  I like the zoom feature also.  I have not used all the available controls included but will investigate those soon.
security,works,I Love that i can see mysecurity cameras on my big screen via this app on my Amazon Fire TV
power,Nice for those who wish to monitor video from their Amazon Fire TV monitors.,"This allows me to monitor IP cameras around my home. It lacks some controls, but is decent at providing the needed service."
power,Great App - Review with improvement request,Really like this app. Using with two Foscam cameras.  Using app mostly with Kindle Fire hd.  I have had it lock up the tablet on a few occasions when the tablet sat idle for a while. Only solution was to force a power off. It would be good to have the controls recognize if the camera has been flipped and mirrored. Still give the app a 5 star rating.best
security,Great alternative to the pricey Blue Iris,"Great phone application for our Foscam cameras.  We have two Foscam cameras and used the embedded DDNS on both.  I changed the ports (from the default) on both cameras forsecurity and this application allows easy configuration on unusual port numbers.  The only problem is that moving the camera on the application sometimes results in placing it Patrol mode (where it continuously scans).  But, ""free"" is still a lot better than paying for Blue Iris."

universalism,Don't Try It! I Lost My Work!,"I'm unable to use it. I'm a writer and everything I type into is lost to it. I can read within the program but I can't copy & paste, attach, email, or send to anything else so I essentially have lost hours worth of work.I tried the free version and I'm not paying a year's subscription for something that doesn't work. I'm disabled. I live on SSI so I'm not made of money. It's false advertising to say it's free and then lock an individual's work within the program so that it's irretrievable without paying for a year's subscription.There is nothing user friendly about it. I've used many word processor programs and never had a problem understanding them. This one makes no sense at all. The only reason I keep on my Kindle is so don't lose my work completely."
self direction,"Good to use on a tablet, don't need it on my laptop","I was looking for office software that would function on a tablet, which I travel with more now than I do the laptop. The software is good and works well while creating or editing your document. The trouble is moving your document from your tablet to a cloud (OneDrive or Dropbox e.g.) so that you can share it with others and download it to your laptop or PC. The company offering the product (MobiSystems) doesn't make it plain upfront, but you need another app of theirs called File Commander to do this. After about an hour of effort, I stumbled upon it. Now you know upfront."

Using only the free version, thus far, I've been able to write up a fairly long article for publication. At one point I thought I had lost the entire thing - I had saved much earlier, but was very pleased and surprised when I pulled the app back up to find I was exactly where I had left off.A few more instructions would be appropriate such as setting up ""cloud"" and retrieving from the ozone.  Also, copy/paste and the ability to move words, sentences and paragraphs around would be appreciated.This is a somewhat large app, so be sure you've the available room for it. If you tend to write a lot of reports or articles, and you're short on room, I'd find something to send to the Netherworld and get this app.Since I've not used any of the other functions, I cannot accurately rate them.  I am basing this review solely on the word processing ability which is why I downloaded it in the first place."

self direction,"OfficeSuite Pro used to be my go to Kindle app, then came the &#34;update&#34;","Going back to 2012, there were file management functions in the pre-installed and the upgrade versions of OfficeSuite. It was nice. Then late in 2015 I had the new version notification for Pro. Wow, now I don't have file management anymore (without buying &#34;File Commander&#34;). Well my request for help was answered with questions about version and operating system but I thought that I gave very clear answers. I'm still waiting for a solution. By the way, the new interface is clutzy, definitely a worse version than I had. Incidentally the old interface is still to be found on Amazon's pre-installed version on my Kindle but after the &#34;update&#34;, that version won't open pdf files. Amazon won't deal with it because there are newer Kindles sold apparently without OfficeSuite. The new free version will read pdf files, but also no file management. There's an offer to upgrade to OfficeSuite Premium. What's that?"

So it felt like an invasive action; posing as ""free"" it was an opportunity to take time and energy to bug me saying: well if you really want this product you need to buy the master version. Why not be honest and just advertize the real product up front? Now, however, I am totally dis-inclined to buy any of the products, having gotten the bad taste of dishonesty in my mouth.

The functionality of this app is fine, while the user interface is quite complicate for young users with limited experience on office software.The big problem of this free version is that it keeps popping up reminders for upgrading to premium version, to the frequency of annoying. It also always want me to sign up for its own cloud account, which I regard as completely unnecessary and potentially risky. Moreover, it comes without font style as basic as Times New Roman. And if you'd like to have this font in option list, you will have to pay for it. Frankly I wouldn't mind to pay for some fancy font, but Times New Roman? Seriously?It's quite obvious to me that this so called ""free"" version put more effort in persuading users to pay than creating a smooth user experience by providing a solid service. I got rid of it in a few days."

I'm a bit bemused by the myopia of whoever is in charge of the rollout of carrots-for-customers at MobiSystems, Inc. Not even a 15-day trial version with Track Changes mode? Or Insert? Or Review? MobiSystems is - ostensibly - targeting OfficeSuite at professionals and semiprofessionnels, who prefer to check out the competence and minutiae of an editing suite before plonking down the money for the full-blown version. This penny-pinching isn't what I expected. Uninstalled without a second thought."

power,"Sketch Guru-A little challenging to actually ""sketch""","This would be a nice little app IF using a stylus or ""pen"" type. With a finger, it is more challenging to make it look like the photo that comes with the app. It has a nice set of brushes to choose from, but hard to control with the fingers. It also seems to randomly erase areas if you go over a certain part of the screen-I am not sure if it is the program or not. It only allows you to do it in portrait mode, not landscape. (The menu buttons are in portrait mode only-will not rotate if you turn your screen.) Instead of sketching, I just play with the different colors and brushes-it will allow circles, watercolor, spray, thick and thin, fur and so forth to draw with. It has a play button and will ""play"" each step you did. Really fun for children to watch their handiwork reappear again."
self direction,totally great app to express your creativity,"Sketch Guru is a great app for creating unique pics expressing ur own creativity. U can save ur pictures to ur photos file and then post as u would like.  Since it has so many drawing tools, u can create very different types of art from pencil drawings to neon spraypainted pics. All in all, it's great. Would love to see if a stylus could be used to increase precision on smaller details. Will try that next!"
self direction,Seems like a nice app...but freezes a LOT.,This seems like it would be a great app.  The controls and selection of tools are great and I was creating some awesome looking sketches.  The problem is this freezes a lot on my Kindle Fire HD.  So I deleted it and will not download again.
power,Spare time fun,"Great time-killer while waiting at Dr office, etc. Still trying to control the options but I love the creativity it allows."
self direction,Two poor design issues,"Nice app but with two issues that affect my use of it.First, the app, which lives in portrait mode, does not reorient itself when you rotate the kindle 180 degrees. This is just a case of lazy programming since every other app knows how to do this.  (This is important because some cases situate the camera to the left and others situate it to the right.)Second, on the HDX 7&#34;, the app's control buttons are practically on top of the kindle's home and back buttons, which makes the app unusable by me because  I am unable to tap on the app's buttons.In my rating, the orientation problem cost it a fraction of a star but the inability to access the control buttons was the thing that really brought the rating down. Still, the app shows a lot of promise so I hope the developer addresses these problems.Thank you."
self direction,I love it,Amazing! This helped me ALOT with my art work and it even made it better then I thought it would be
universalism,A decent little sketcher,"I'll admit it up front -- I'm a sucker for draw-and-paint programs on mobile devices. There's something deeply satisfying about noodling around on a touch screen, building up an image. You learn early on that you can't expect to make anything as detailed or realistic as you can with physical media, or even a PC-based drawing program hooked up to a drawing tablet. But that's just the nature of the beast. They're built for different purposes.Sketch Guru is the latest offering from Bejoy Mobile, a company that specializes in simple drawing programs for mobile devices. In some ways, this is simpler than most. There are no layers, for instance -- everything is created on a single plane. There is no flood-fill tool. There is only a color palette, a color-sampler tool, and a set of brushes.But what brushes they are! These are not your normal set of smooth-or-fuzzy lines, virtual mimics of physical media such as pencils, marker pens or brushes. They are computational brushes, brushes driven by algorithms that transcend mere imitation. The ""furry"" ones sense the presence of nearby lines, and generate cross-linkages to them. There is a brush that creates a regularly-spaced grid of concentric circles. There is a brush that draws a swath of crosshatching, like loosely-woven cloth. The result is that even simple doodles acquire a subtle complexity, effects usually associated with much more sophisticated media.There are three other features that boost this product from 4-star ""Like it"" to 5-star ""Love it"". The first is the ""Rainbow Color"" option, a feature used in many of Bejoy's products, which cycles the color through the spectrum as you draw. Lifting your finger from the touch-screen changes the color. This is more of a gimmick than a serious tool, but it's a heck of a lot of fun. And, with careful selection of the algorithmic ""brushes"", it can create some stunning effects.The second ""5-star"" feature is the ability to send a drawing directly into another program. I have been pairing Sketch Guru with Autodesk's SketchBook Mobile, a more sophisticated drawing program. There, I can add new layers and work up the raw sketches from Sketch Guru into something more complex. The export doesn't always work properly, but it's worth fussing with it.The third ""5-star"" feature is the price. This is a free app. As in, actually free, not ""freemium"", where you get the basic program free but then need to purchase add-on features. You can't get any better than that!"
self direction,excellent.,I have always been skeptical about tablet drawing apps. But I thought  I would give this one a try an  I'm so glad I did. Excellent app.
self direction,"Fun, easy-to-use drawing app","This drawing app is very simple yet a lot of fun. After choosing a canvas color, you can choose from a variety of brushes and colors to create your own image. Some brushes are more traditional, similar to what you would find in the Microsoft Paint application (such as opaque brushes of various thicknesses and a spray-can-like choice), whereas others are just fun, such as a brush that draws different size squares. Highly recommended."
self direction,Cool app!,"This app is great! I thought that it would be like all the others and have no brush patterns. But I was sooooo wrong. When I finished my first drawing, I was surprised that I had been drawing for about 30 minutes. It doesn't look just like it would with a pencil or paint brush, but it looks pretty good with just a finger. You get amazing designs to give your art a cool effect and texture. It's great for anyone that likes to draw and it's FREE. If you're considering it, I suggest that you get it. SERIOUSLY!"
power,Surprisingly good tool,"Less basic than you would think! Great app for drawing and speed painting... you can blend color surprising well with the brushes offered, and have some control over opacity.. or you can use the delightfully textured chunky brushes available. I LOVE the shadow brush, guys, very nice. You can pan around the canvas and zoom in to work on detail, and you can hide the toolbar. After just a few minutes I felt very comfortable with this program.No layer support and few customizable brushes, but it does what it set out to do. High marks."
self direction,Beautiful sketching app,I really like to watch my child interact with this app. She creates many unique peices. This app was very well thought out for many age groups on different creative levels. I'm sure this would even be awesome for adults.

self direction,layers? saved progress? where it at?,so I was working on a piece that was going to take me a while- I thought that if I saved the image it would save my place in work. so I backed out of the app to come back later. but when I came back it was a blank page. I'm upessti spaghetti. there also are no layers???
power,This is a great app!,"This is a wonderful drawing app.  It is the best art app I have seen so far... It offers many different tools and effects.  I have more control over the tools in this app, than I have had in other drawing apps."
power,Fun sketching program!,"Fairly intuitive to get started with, lots of controls over drawing tools, you can draw with stylus or finger, save work, send work to yourself via email to further manipulate on a computer. I am having fun with it!"
tradition,improvements for me! more waiting for others.,This app has changed the way i look at my art. It helps bring in new perspectives with the option of using a photo as a stencil or free handing it. It is a great way to send hand sketched photos to friends and family. You have many different brush stroke options my recommendation and favorite is ribbon and to fill spaces water color. I spent a very long time searching for a digital sketch app that fits my needs and by far this one won my heart instantly. When i first opened it i was thing to my self this looks childish and mediocre but is actually more advanced than it first looks. Trust me this wont sit there waiting to be deleted you Will constantly use it and create beautiful art. This app is also very high quality your final product looks great and the original photo also looks great. I highly recommended this app for people who want to get the creative juices flowing or a new take on traditional paper and pencil sketching.
self direction,It's pretty good,"I really like the app. It's very enjoyable and great for creating cartoonish pictures, but not so much very realistic pics. I find it fun to draw using my fingers with this app, but I wish I could use a stylus or something else to be more accurate with my lines, because nothing else but my fingers will make the lines show up :( (I use my Kindle Fire HD for this app). Also, the app has stopped working on more than one occasion, for no reason. It's not that I run many apps at the same time, because I don't. The most I've ever run at the same time is Silk and Pandora. I hardly have any apps at all, so it's not the memory. Why is it ""not responding""?"
power,great little drawing app,"This is a pretty cool little app, especially considering it's free. Easier to use with a stylus since it gives you better control."
power,Excellent,"Installed on my Kindle Fire HD, it's stable, easy, delivers as promised and free. Like its ""paint"" counterpart, this app is one of the best. Having searched for a drawing program to quickly serve a number of purposes on the run, this app fills every need without going overboard. Controls are direct, simple and effective. The ""animation"" feature is interesting but without real purpose. With the possible exception of maybe some additional features like ""shapes"", most any other criticism would be nit-picking. Bottom line... it's a ""keeper""."

self direction,very useful,I thought this app is very useful for editing and creating new photos. And very fun to play around with
universalism,outstanding,this game is perfect for everyone. My favorite pictures to draw are nature because of the very cool lines and pencils.
self direction,Pretty awesome for the price of free!,"I just downloaded this app, and so far it lives up to my expectations. I'm in college for an art related degree, so I'm pretty knowledgeable when it comes to digital painting programs. I was looking for a free painting app that I would be able to create decent quality digital sketches with. I haven't tried out many others, but I was happy to see this one offered a lot of the things I was looking for. Here's a list of pros and cons I've thought of after exploring the app for a few minutes.Pros: Better brush selection than I expected. Some of them seem a bit impractical for serious art, but for something creative and fun, its pretty cool!Ability to adjust brush width and opacity.Effective color selection. I haven't figured out if colors picked may be saved for easy reselection, but if so that would be a super bonus.Ability to undo stepsI haven't explored the eraser tool, but its good that its thereThe video playback is super cool, but I haven't figured out if the videos are able to be saved.I haven't explored what the photo editing feature does, but its cool to know its there.Ability to save. Note: images seem to save only as a PNG file.I didn't spend much time testing it, but it seemed to run pretty smooth with no lagging or choppy lines.If the eyedropper tool works like any other program with an eyedropper tool does, it should be to select colors from your image. I haven't tried it yet, but if that's what it does, bravo to the developers.Cons: Upon first opening the app, it looks like a kids doodling app.The ads are annoying, but to be expected with a free app.No layering features for the serious digital artistsIf there's no way to save the video playback, I think it would be something the developers should add in an update.Another note for the developers. Maybe add an option to save the file as a jpg.This is what I came up with on first impression. So far it seems pretty useful. For the price of free, its great, and I think its worth trying out."
self direction,Three Stars,Did not do what I thought it would do
self direction,"kind of enjoyable to use, but ads are obnoxious","The variety of brush styles is fun to play with. Drawing with my finger was more responsive than I'd expected (this was on a Google 7 tablet). The permissions seem reasonable enough (the network perms would be needed for any app that provides posting to Facebook or displays a stream of ads, as this one does).But those ads -- they're up at the top and fairly out of the way, but they are constantly scrolling and popping a new one up, and it gets REALLY distracting. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad in a fast action game, but when you're drawing, you want calm and a chance to reflect on what to do next -- an opportunity you just don't get with this app.And when you exit, it splashes a full-screen version of one of the ads, just as an extra little unpleasantness.Sad to say, I'll probably uninstall and hope that a less-pushy drawing app comes along."
self direction,Fun!,I think I have finally found a sketching app that is easy to use and fun to use.  I'm looking for a stylus with a narrower tip.  My fat fingers and my wide stylus prevents me from creating finer images.

self direction,False advertising,I am very unhappy with the events surrounding the purchase of the Kindle. I bought the Kindle specifically for my daughter to read books and Skype while she was on her five month trip. We promptly got our purchase but were unable to open the download of the Skype app. We phoned for technical support and the agent went through the download process with us. It did not work. The agent was aware that I had read a number of product reviews that the new Kindle Fire was capable of Skype. They thought there might be a licensing issue and that they would make my concern known and that someone would contact me with an answer on way or another with in a week or so.. That was December 19th and no one ever did. I could have returned the Kindle and gotten another tablet if I had known. I think that Kindle/Amazon should be dealing with this discrepency and communicating what the issues are rather than avoiding a customer. I am a new Amzon user (first purchase was a Kinndle) and I don't feel that the customer service reflects the amount of emails I am receiving promoting specials etc. Maybe the company should focus on keeping customers by responding to issues.

If left  On they can easily gain root access and steal your identity or Worse. When this operation  Started before Microsoft bought it this was a peer to peer application where no middle man can just access video and audio that is absolutely private. Now that Microsoft owns it they run it through their servers and keep your video and audio in possible perpetuity.

I had heard a lot about the Kindle Fire and decided to update my existing one.  I purchased mine at the shop in the airport, after having passed through the Customs.......only to find when I opened the packaging that there was no camera facility - hence not able to use Skype.  The shop assistant who sold it to me made no mention of it not having a camera, so it has been an expensive mistake on my part.Having said that, the Kindle Fire is easy to handle, small enough to fit into my handbag - it tends to be slightly heavy so  I do need to make sure i don't carry too many others things in it.  Downloading books is extremely simple and almost immediate!  Using the internet is simple, getting Apps takes time.  I do think the instruction booklet could be more comprehensive though, it's very brief.  I had to resort to the Amazon help section on it, to find out how to do some things.  Once I had mastered how to do these things, it's a delight to have."

Also, when someone calls me there is no ringing, no notification at all. When I open the app it just says missed call. And finally, the app will not let me send text messages.

Not seeing who is online, not able to set my own status (no matter how many times i try to change my status to active, it always switches back to ""invisible"" on its own, so my contacts do not see me online either), contacts list is a trash dump, no way to organize contacts into groups - the list is endless!

power,Bad port of a good service.,"The worst aspect of this app is that it continually fails to push messages from people. Often I will message someone only to suddenly have several messages sent to me hours before suddenly load. To the other people, it just appears I am ignoring them. Signing on to the desktop app at the same time will make the messages show up and be received immediately, but then what is the point of using the app if I have to use the desktop?The interface was already bad and they continue to make it worse with each update. Now contacts are separated into a long alphabetical directory rather than simply allowing you to see who is online at a glance. The desktop interface is fine, and I'm not sure why they feel the need to try and deviate from it.You cannot choose any status but online or invisible. Worse, you can't see if anyone else has their status set as away or busy. You simply see them as online, when in reality they may not want to be disturbed.The desktop program is fine. The mobile app however is handicapped in several ways. If you need a way to use Skype from your phone or tablet, this is unfortunately your best option. If you are just looking for a video/instant messaging app that doesn't need to be Skype, then choose something else."
self direction,Horribel,"At first this app was amazing! But then bad stuff starting happening, first, my messages weren't sending for a while. Then when they started sending, the app said I can update it. I was so excited to see what new stuff they did with Skype! Until after I updated it, when I tried logging in again, it said they didn't recognise my email\phone number\name! I tried more than once and it never worked. When I first got this app I thought it was amazingly designed, but now I feel like its the worst messaging app ever. I'm deleting this app right away."
self direction,Was a Good Program Before Microsoft..,"I believe that I've used Skype for at least the last 10-12 years, and I have to admit I thought it was a much better program before being purchased by Microsoft. The program used to work flawlessly, no dropped calls, no problems hearing one side or the other, etc. I can't rate Skype for computer to computer calling. For calling computer to landline from overseas, my calls are are almost routinely dropped or there's a clicking noise on the line; and usually one side or the other can't make out parts of the conversation. Unfortunately I haven't found another vendor who provides a comparable service that's any more reliable."
self direction,Doesn't work for me,"This will be my third Skype account.  So far none of them work properly.  My first attempt with Skype was about five years ago and it worked perfectly.  Since then, it is constantly degraded to the point where I get garbled sound and no video.  I thought by having it on my Kindle.  My problem would be resolved.  No such luck.  I think Skype just does not like me.  I know it is not my Internet connection because the next step up would be to full commercial satellite receiving.  It does work okay for instant message, though, but that's not why I bought it.  Yes, I even purchased an upgrade version for my computer and it still does not work.  Skype and me just don't agree.  I sure hope someone from Skype reads this review and offers me some help because their customer service is probably the worst in the industry"
power,Used to be great until most recent update.,"This was a terrific program and my chat of choice.  It had very intuitive chat, great voice chat and decent video chat.  Now it got a facelift in this last update and now you can't hit enter to send messages...it's now a button up in the chat area that the keyboard covers up.  You used to be able to change your status from online to away or invisible or offline....now you can't.  You're online as long it's running and have to completely shut down the kindle to turn it off.  Before this update I rated this at about a 5*....now that's no longer friendly to use at all it's down to 2*....and that's being generous.  Looks like this is now a PC only program again for its useability because that platform hasn't gotten the horrible facelift.  So much for talking to friends elsewhere in the house!"
self direction,Not Bad at All,"After I downloaded this app on my Amazon Tablet,I really enjoyed it. The app was way better than what I thought.

When I sign in with the Skype ID I use on my PC, and it worked fine. In fact, I really liked the camera function because it was better than the Kindle one.  Both the video & camera had nice zoom and brightness controls. BUT now with the new update, I don't even see the ""take a picture"" option any more and the video messaging doesn't have all those controls any more.  On the UPSIDE, the video when you are chatting with someone is a lot clearer and sharper.  Hope they add back the camera function."

It was a working program until they ""improved"" it.Don't bother. Pick a different messaging system."

tradition,unable to send photos... still,"It's been well over a year since I've been able to send photos via Skype on the kindle fire. Both of my nieces have kindle fires and they have the same issue. I can send them photos from other devices (traditional computers, iPad, iPhone, and my Microsoft Surface) and they can receive those photos. But one cannot send jpegs via Skype for Kindle. This update did not address that issue."
power,Crashing and volume issues,"The main issue I have with Skype is the fact that it crashes constantly. I could be video chatting with someone or simply rotating my kindle before Skype decides it's too much for it to handle that it will crash. After the update, I also noticed I wasn't able to hear the person I called, even after raising the volume all the way up. Took me a while to realize that you can raise the volume specifically for Skype calls that you can ONLY access just as you are calling the person before they answer (you do this by pressing the volume control on the side of the tablet).PLEASE FIX THIS. It is very annoying and highly inconvenient."
power,Nightmare Customer Service,"I was having trouble with skype, so I called their customer service number and long story short, the tech man was somehow able to remote control the computer I was trying to use skype on. He controlled my mouse and was able to click on my settings. When I told him to stop, he threatened me. It was a nightmarish experience and I will never have anything to do with Skype ever again."
self direction,"Works well for the most part, but...","For the most part, Skype works well on my Kindle Fire HD. Have tested it out in different locations and I've conceded at this point that my dropped calls at home are due to my questionable internet service provider. HOWEVER -- Skype ALWAYS crashes if I'm signed-in to Skype and (like most people) put the Kindle in sleep mode when not in use with it password enabled. When I receive a call and need to unlock my Kindle, Skype crashes and I receive an error message that simply reads ""Skype has stopped."" I wouldn't even be writing this review if it didn't happen EVERY SINGLE TIME.Another small complaint is that it takes far too long to sign in. I'm waiting in excess of 30 seconds during the sign-in process. It takes a fraction of that time on the mobile version and the PC version. It is in my personal opinion that the Kindle version needs MUCH improvement.I'd be interested to know if any others are experiencing the crashing problem or if it's just me."
self direction,very broken,I can not for the life of me get this app to work. I thought it was my tablet so I tried my husband's and it crashed on. His constantly and froze the device. Please fix this so I can talk to my family again. I really liked to be able to video call them. I can't anymore :/
power,Used to good but now worst than ever,"Every update make it more unstable, lit off black screen starting the video call, than not responding. Volume control only after conversation start, before that you can only adjust an other volume, look s like the warnings. This is the only app what adjust something else what they should. No Mic sensitivity setup, on phone no camera or selection. They made a good app to pain to use, so you look for an alternative. If Google hangout stars to work on kindle, this one is gone.One star because the last version was broken too, but at least that was worked."
self direction,wont update conversations,"Its pretty good at first. Until i noticed i never got updates on my conversations, i thought no one was talking but instead the app would not alert me about messages, or show them, it stopped showing messages all together. Making me miss important  information details, an  conversation  all together. I was unaware of its doing until i opened up SKYPE on the computer 115 missed messages. For some this is the only way to contact me so i deem this unacceptable for an app to do. Extremely dissatisfied"
power,Appalling to say least,"I cannot write how unbelievably awful the new update is but let's try shall we. It CONSTANTLY crashes not only the app its self but my whole freaking kindle! You can no longer control the volume when you have it on in the background, you could have it on nothing and still have the call blaring on full blast! When it has crashed and you restart the app it can still call, although for a video calling service you often end up with no video at all! Just freaking perfect and the best part is, there is no going back, you can no longer get an actual fully functional version of Skype. At the moment, you are better off with Oovoo!!"
self direction,disappointing,"Have used this app before with limited success on an Android phone. Got it again pre-installed on my Kindle but due to usage issues I don't go on often enough to remember my password. I attempted creating a new account as it would not send a ""forgot password"" email and the app refused to cooperate. No matter what or how many characters I used for a password it insisted it was always too short, it managed to change my user name to something completely off the wall (which was not a result of any text autocorrect), and sadly, was just an overall useless app at a moment when it was a personally important  to have. I will be researching other video chat/text apps that I'm certain will be less headache to use."
self direction,Skype pain.,Well I would have thought that they would have fixed Skype by now. Mine crashed and burned big time. I uninstalled and I reinstalled. I guess I'll have to see what happens but I'm not too confident considering all the reviews.

self direction,#ULTRA EXTRODANARY,"I love this app, it's the most amassing app for calls and video calls! You can get your friends and family to call you and see them if you chose.

And there's also a chat so you can talk to them by reading and typing. But even better, you can create group calls a chat to all of the people on that call! There is a certain area  where you can buy ""skype credits"" to call someone's phone but everything else should be free!"
self direction,COMPLETE GARBAGE,"COMPLETE GARBAGE! I had to uninstall it on my Kindle Fire HD 8 because the option for ""keep me signed in"" wasn't there even though the Skype chat agent says it's supposed to be on every platform and also because no form of sound or vibrate notifications were coming through for an incoming call. When I tried to reinstall it, it opened the first time as if it's going to successfully reinstall, but when it had downloaded and in the installing step, it stopped at around 90% and wouldn't go further. I thought it was because of a bad Wi-Fi signal, so I out it on the router directly and still didn't work. Cancelled the install attempt and tried to search for Skype again to download and experienced the whole it trying to open but closes after half a second."

Sometimes when I'm talking with someone on Skype and I go off the app to another one, it stops and disconnects my call. Yes, the appearance looks better, but technological wise, it sucks. Please get the bugs fix :/ I hate it. The camera on Skype is disoriented for my Kindle Fire. I thought maybe it was my device or internet connection, but I tried restarting it and everything, but the condition still is the same. It's bad for me that's why I'm leaving a review for those of you who haven't updated Skype yet to NOT UPDATE IT. Hopefully it gets better so I can change the star ratings :/"
power,"Not the greatest, but what else you gonna do.","It crashes for no reason, doesn't stay connected.  Text messages are not always delivered or only part is.  Status messages don't display reliably.  Other than that it's great."
self direction,AWESOME!,"I can text my friends (who I never get to see) and I can video call them too. I thought skype was only for computers but it turns out, it's on the Appstore. Get it it's free and works on kindle fire hd!"
power,Problem With the Volume,"I do not use this program anymore because there is a problem with the Volume control -- I contacted customer service about this and they worked me through this, but with every new update -- the problem comes back -- low volume and no way to adjust this on the Kindle Fire!"
self direction,my camera,Soo everything was working fine then after like 15 min. Of using it my camera stopped working. I thought it was the app so I un installed it but my camera on my kindle nor vine is letting me use my camera. It wad before I downloaded this. HELP
power,kindle fire compatibility issues?,"Please, for the love of the powers that be, do something about the compatibility issues with the kindle fire, any messages I send, no matter who they're to, or if they're online/offline the message will be in ""pending"" status for anywhere from an hour to several days, and logging in/out - rebooting my kindle doesn't work two stars for these reasons, other wise, would be five, long time Skype user"
self direction,no good app,It does not work for very  good.  It stops working right in the middle of talking with some one.  It needs to get better.  I like my kindle hd.  I thought it was going to do as well as theI pad
self direction,Kindle Fire HD,"I never thought I would admit it, but now that I have one and have played with it for a bit; yah! Another wonderful and fun toy. Thanks, best little all purpose pad out there!"
power,Skype is good!!!,This app is a really good app there's nothing wrong with this app you have control on your volume etc. If you get this app you will be very happy I promise this app will not let you down. I use skype all the time I like using it it's so much fun.
power,volume,Skype was great until the update on the kindle.. now I can't control the volume.I have no of talking my friends walking to the bus!! :(
self direction,Bugs all the time.,Freaking lag all the time and it cut off my video calls and I can't seem to call them back. So i have to shut it down and reopen but just to find out that it freaking bug again. I thought you guys were supposed to be the official trustworthy brand or something. You guys let me down.
self direction,New skype,"I thought it was me being useless but have read the reviews 're the new Skype and,thankfully it's not. I can't sync contacts, or even use the new Skype on my kindle fire,although it's useable on my phone."
self direction,Horrable,I doesn't let me get through the first step of creating an account
power,"Skype's ringer volume is to low to hear, even ...","Skype's ringer volume is to low to hear, even when you are connected to a blue tooth speaker.  And the voice volume controls have very little effect. Do not buy a fire phone if you intend to use Skype."
self direction,FIX THE UPDATE,The new update for skype made skype just break. The screen for it is just black I thought reinstalling would help but nope! Skype will not even download again. It just is going to be a file In my cloud in til this is fixed.
power,not sure,"some of my contacts have a white mystery mark on there status so I cant tell if there busy or not, not much a big deal but what does it meen?"
power,what a ridiculous situation,"Volume from the external speakers is far to low to be useful, and doesn't seem to be under the control of the kindle fire HD I hold in my hands.Very depressing, as I bought this device for my 80 grandmother in-law, with the idea they could get away from the older PC, and Skype anywhere in the house.Solved the issue by ""side loading"" Skype 3.2 from the Skype website. (Google search should show you how to do both.)This almost ended up in us returning this device for an iPad, which in my experience, works as advertised to right out of the box.If anyone asks me in the future, should I get an iPad or a kindle, thus experience will be part of what I tell them."
power,crash,The Skype app for Kindle Fire is awfully. No  volume control and always crashing.
self direction,DON'T BE FOOLED THIS APP IS NOT FREE!!!!!,"When I got this app I thought what a better way to talk to my friends, but this app is free to the download but you have to pay for credits to call or video chat. This app is a dumb app that is not free. I DON'T recommend this app at all."
self direction,Love it,"Skype is even better on Kindle then I thought, so keep up the good work, just keep up the good work."
power,Does not work,Skype came installed on my new Kindle Fire HD and it absolutely sucks. It freezes constantly and then causes the Kindle to restart. The volume is ridiculously low and there isn't a volume control for Skype specifically. I'd say this is completely unusable on the Kindle.  I'd give zero stars if I could.
self direction,Thought it would make me cool,"Jeez Louise. I thought this chiz was gonna be the breakthrough for me being a cool kid. But it turns out that I have no friends and Skype won't give me any. Then it got bad. I would pretend I had friends. But then I gained 500 pounds and started getting followed by local stray cats. Skype is ruining my life. Run, Carl, run as fast as you can before the people of Skype software S.a.r.I come after you and a much more unfortunate series of events haunts you."
self direction,Good,"good and fast connect ,but during voice call sometime there is voice distraction,and video is getting hanged.There is no friend search option and  video chat and Message simultaneous cannot be posible"
security,Good but too much crashing,The app has everything I really need but it lacks stability. The app crashes roughly five to six times a day. I wish it wouldn't crash so much if it didn't I would've  given it maybe q 5 star rating. I do hope that sometime soon you create group calls an  not misanthropy chats.
power,No Volume!,"I love Skype on my pc and phone but am extremely disappointed to learn that it doesn't work properly on the Kindle Fire HD. We just set it up so that my son can chat with my mom but the volume is far too faint to hear a word. There are no volume controls in the app itself, so the only control is from the device. I have the volume up all the way but still can't hear a thing.I read some of the more recent comments and reviews and it seems that everyone is having the same issue.Didn't anyone test this before the release?"
self direction,very nice!,This new kindle hd I recently bought is really nice! And this Skype app keeps me in thought with my immediate family in Florida all the way from NY! Thanks guys awesome job!!! :)
self direction,so fun,"I'm giving this 5 stars because I can now video chat with my daughter. with missing her so much, it's nice to sit and chat. I get to see her facial reactions to my stories. AND ITS FREE. great to keep up with friends and loved ones.not a hard app to use, either."
self direction,Wonderful App,"Whoever made this App gets a double thumbs up. Ive tried rather hard and you cant get any feed back from it, even full blast music wont get you feed back on the Kindle Fire HD. Rather easy to use, and has some good settings options that i not sure that exists in the pc version even thought it should. That bwing said, it doesnt have an its own volume control, so dont expect to watch or listen to anything while chatting with a friend."
power,Some things to note about the latest Skype version,"I have had a 32GB 8.9 HD kindle since it first came out in late 2012 & some earlier models. If you read through many of the reviews you should notice that most of the 5 star ones were written shortly after the release of the HD series in late 2012 & early 2013. On the other hand, the poor 1 & 2 star reviews were written since late 2013 & later.I would agree with this as it matches my own experience. The original Skype for the Kindle Fire HD series worked very well but an update issued sometime late last year changed all of this. There appears to be two main issues:1. SOUND VOLUME:Even if your volume is set all of the way up before launching Skype, conversations are barely audible. This may be because MS/Skype expect you to use ear buds which is a common way to use the app. If you in fact do this then you will find the audio level to be okay. HOWEVER, if you don't use ear buds then check the volume setting within Skype using the hardware volume switch and you will probably notice that the volume is way down around 25%. If you raise the volume to 100% using the hardware volume control then conversations can be heard okay just like the earlier version and it stays this way in subsequent sessions. They may have made the initial setting this way to prevent ear bud users from blowing out their ears.2. CRASHES:I don't know what to say about this except to confirm that I have had the same experience. Skype starts okay but invariably crashes (frozen screen, no sound, etc.) within 5 minutes and will then the Kindle will spontaneously reboot. This makes what is otherwise an excellent app next to useless.So, this problem has been around for over 6 months without being fixed. Amazon gets a failing grade from me on this issue as they should at least make the original version available for download from their app store for folks having this problem while they are sorting out the issues with the latest version."
power,"poor audio, credit card fraud from skype","The audio was horrible with the speakers or the headset.  The video was alright.  Controls, settings are minimal.  2 weeks after I started using skype on kindle fire hd, I had six unauthorized charges on my credit card from skype.  I have used skype on several computers for years, but never purchased anything.  The only way to connect my skype account with my credit card was amazon prime/kindle.  That's pretty sad.  Skype  is removed from my account."
self direction,Not really free,Thought this was a free app so my granddaughter could text me without her mom buying her a phone and realized it really isnÃ¢??t a free texting app.  Was looking for a free texting app for her kindle fire
self direction,Waste of le time,"It works-ish.  You can call and text, but you have to watch TONS of ads.  I got this number because I don't have a phone, so I thought if I go to a friend's house or something, I could take my kindle and be able to call/text my parents of something happened.  WRONG.  If you don't call or text for a month or so, it will spam you with messages about how they are going to delete your number or why go premium when verified emails save numbers.  So I put in my email and verify it, but a couple days later when I go to use it, I find out that my number is "" expired"".  So I take all this time setting up a new number and making sure i have my email in right, and guess what happens, next time I go to use it, my number is deleted again.  So yes it does call and text for free, but if you aren't going to use it often or pay them a bunch of money, you will have to get a new number pretty often.  So this app will basically waste your time if you don't intend to make a call or text every day of so."
self direction,This Is Perfect,This is perfect because when I first got my kindle I was very mad because i thought I could text my friend but I couldn't.Then I found this app and we text each other all the time.Ã°???
self direction,Not for Kids,"I got this app for my daughters kindle so that she could message her dad, her cousin, and me. Some random person texted my child! And I could not access the messages from the TextMe website.I wish that only people her in contacts can contact her but not sure that's possible. I don't feel this app is safe for children.I also feel that the app isn't user friendly. There are some issues with functionality and ease in adding/naming/deleting contacts.UPDATED March 2017: while our account was still active, TextMe issued OUR phone number to another person (I'm assuming a child). My husband and I have iPhones. When our daughter first received her TextMe number we input them into our Contacts and texted her several times over the course of a few months.Well this morning my husband texted our daughter to get up and get dressed but someone else responded: ""I don't know you! You're not my dad!"" At first my husband thought our daughter was joking around. It led to a series of texts. Our daughter denied getting or sending any texts. She showed us her app, we tried texting her, and nothing showed up. Instead someone else replied.I apologized to the other person and told them to notify their parents about this. His or her last text to me was them telling me that they were SCARED and to stop texting them.They should be scared! This is BAD! I immediately deleted my daughter's profile (which was still active) and uninstalled the app. This is not safe."
security,Really bad app,You had to give it info I was not wishing to give and I felt it would be asecurity risk to run this app.
self direction,Two Stars,Thought it would have been a wifi call
self direction,cool app it's better quality than most text apps,In my opinion this app deserves five stars but they could add something to make the app look cooler to attract more customersÃ°??Â I did have second thoughts about if I should get it but I decided I would try it out and I have been highly impressed I really recommend this app for you well I wish you all  the best byeÃ°???
self direction,Two Stars,Didn't work as my children thought it would.
self direction,Do not use,This app worked great for a year. Then I missed messages. No one could receive my messages. Now most cell carriers do not even see the numbers they give you as a real number. There is no way to complain or a forum to find answers. I lived in Kentucky when I got the app and got a New Jersey number. It offers free credits for watching ads. You do not get the credits most of the time. It caused problems between my wife to be and myself. She thought I was ignoring her. So if you use this app know that it rarely if ever works and don't try to communicate with the ones you love because it will end badly....  Thank you TextMe for putting a gap between me and the one I love. I would very much like to meet the developers of this app to show them exactly how much pain they caused me.
self direction,Legit,Soooooo Soooooo good I thought this might be a scam but it's not I definitely recommend this app
self direction,Doesn't work!,It says unable to connect to the internet when creating a account. Don't waste your time.
self direction,Ehhh.......Ã°???,Well fi r me it didn't really work out like it said it would and I'm new to texting and i thought this would be perfect but I guess not but if your good at upload ing every two minutes to a head.
universalism,Great app!!!!,This is a great app to use if you don't have a cell phone. It takes wifi witch is a little annoying when you leave UR house and can't chat with friends. You can set a signature witch is pretty cool. The only problem I have had with the app so far is that my device didn't have a microphone or a camera so the calling and video message features do not work. I have also received a message from another text me user that I DoD not know but this is not a reoccurring event so I am not to worried about it. This is a great app with tones of great features!!!
self direction,One Star,Not what I thought.
self direction,One Star,"I am dissapointed, I thought I could use my phone, but I got another number."
self direction,LOVE it,GREAT IT WORKS just fine for kindle fire ive used this app for a long time. I wish u cloud face time iphones thought
self direction,works well,I have this on my kindle and it works well.  It meets needs to text and it has a calling function too but I have not used that feature. The only improvement I would suggest is to allow users to create their own address book rather than creating from contacts via email and social media.
self direction,This did not work the way I thought it would ...,This did not work the way I thought it would it was very difficult for me to try and figure out.
power,Ads are a pain! Sound quality is not good at all!,Not to happy with the app. The sound quality is horrible and the ads on the actual message screen are a nightmare. I have this installed for my older kids so I just wish it was a bit easier and simpler. The ads influenced my 3 star rating otherwise I would have gave the app 4. Needs improvement!
self direction,"I don't have a phone, but it gave me a number!","The app worked better than I thought! When I opened the app it asked me to sign up, it asked various of question including your email ( just for verification ). Then I got credits ( what you use to call ) first few were free, but you can get more free credits by watching videos or offers and or you can buy credits. If your using it on your kindle ( I am ) you don't need credits cause I don't have a microphone to speak to people, but you can still call, it actually works to call other people on a number, but it will drop if you don't have a microphone on said device. It actually gives you a number!!"
self direction,Terrible,"Because you use a different phone number, my contacts thought I had gotten a different phone and started texting me from their phones which had picked up my Kindle number. What a mess!! Just a marketing ploy, wont be texting from Kindle again!"
self direction,umm .....?/,"Yea I never was able to ""register"". I grabbed the app yesterday and as of today the status is still at the ""register"" stage.....yes a day later. I wish I could say more positive things about the app, but as of right now.....its not looking to good for pinger and my satisfaction."
self direction,Great texting app,"Textme works beautifully on my Kindle Fire.  Works perfectly with the onboard keypad.  Notifications should, perhaps, be independent of volume setting.  I miss a few since I listen to soft music.  Nice replacement for textplus which seemed to get phased out."
power,revolutionary texting,Love this app it controls email texting and calling
self direction,great app,I really think this is a great app. The only thing I found wrong was you need internet and you can't make calls without credits. Otherwise I thought it was a great app.
stimulation,Great text app,"I previously used Text Plus, but it never notified me of texts. This app does.  I don't have a cell phone, so this works great :)  Very easy to use.  And for those of us with vision impairments, you can set font size to large.  My only complaint is it would be nice to make font even larger than maximum size now, because my vision is that bad :)Otherwise, it's great.  And you can reply to a text while in another app!!!Update:  With the update issued on July 4, 2017 - It took a bit to get the update to actually install.  Then the program simply wouldn't launch.  However, I think technology is against me today :)  So I uninstalled it, and reinstalled it.  And then was able to get into the app.  I must say, the large font is now larger :)  So THANK YOU TextMe developers :)  And I love the new design/interface.  The telephone numbers I text, or the names, are easier to see, as well.  So from this visually challenged person?  A HUGE thank you!!!!  Awesome update!"
self direction,"good, but....","This is an awesome app, except it said free calls. I have to buy credits to call people when I thought this would give me free calls. Anything otherwise is Awesome!"
self direction,Not what I thought,Not what I thought out was gong to be = deleted it
self direction,I'm impressed! Turns your Kindle into a workable phone!,"My phone recently broke and I can't afford a replacement. This app works excellent on my Kindle Fire. Here's the funny thing- everyone said it sounds better than my old phone! I've only had a few calls with bad reception out of several. I tried it on my older Kindle and the sound quality is not good. Be prepared for a lot of ads that show up as a small area above your text box, not a pop-up invasion! but you can pay $5. a month to remove them. It does calls, texts and video chat. The texts allow you to send and receive photos, links and videos. The only awkward thing I found is when you send a pic it gives the person receiving it a link to your Amazon photos instead of showing the photo in the text. You earn credits for doing actions like watching videos but I'm still trying to figure out what you need them for because I have yet to use any of them. I'm sure eventually I'll figure it out. I've been using it for about a week and a half and am very satisfied."
self direction,I thought I would be able to use my current ...,"I thought I would be able to use my current phone #, not be issued a new # for texting."
self direction,Not actual free texting,It didn't see it say anywhere that you have to buy credits to use the texting feature. I thought as long as there was wifi you could text for free..guess not.
self direction,Not true we,Thought it was free
security,No Question,"At a time when we, genuinely, needed it the most...there is no app, and frankly no other form of reality as we know it, that could have, WOULD have, come up any bigger...on the biggest stage, with the biggest stakes, TextMe helped immensely to keep my family (5 kids, 4 still with us, PLUS 1 as we VERY unexpectedly lost the greatest Mommy the world will ever know during premature birth)...Daddy has just overcome Stage IV Cancer (Mommy is the reason for this miracle, make no mistake), given a 10% chance...look, ""fate"" apparently never met my magical wife, my Dream Girl Erin, nor did it meet an app, or any other forum, that could keep a family engulfed in love since moment #1 UNIFIED.  Unified in a way that connects our children to safety,security, optimism...HOPE...in their hearts.  ""HOPE sees the invisible, feels the intangible, and achieves the impossible...""Not without this app, I can personally say without absolute certainty... TextMe, I hope you read this (forget everyone else) & you can hear me say THANK YOU, from the bottom of my heart"
security,Texts Get Blocked,"This app is inconsistent. Some of the time texts send, but others, they are blocked by TextMe because of ""Spammingsecurity"". It does this every time I have a conversation over text. To fix it you have to submit a request online and hope they answer it. Once they do, they'll just block your texts again next time you have a conversation. Not good."
universalism,Too intrusive,"This is an unfair review because I never got past the sign in.  I felt the sign in (up) was way too intrusive and then I had to sign up for another phone number.  This seemed a little too much just so I can text with my friends who own Apple products.  This all may be a misunderstanding of how the Fire works.  At this point, I'm ready to spend a little more and get an IPad mini."
self direction,DO NOT GET THIS APP,This app messed up my tablet for a long time finally got all my apps is ok for texting I think pinger needs to fix its  phone thing because I called my cell phone it would not let my hang up witch scared me because I thought it would keep calling my cell phone don't get this app I don't think texting is good on it at all now so.please don't download this app
self direction,Awesome texting app,It is awesome. My mom thought it would not work well but I am able to text lots of family and friends. You have to have 2 things. WiFi.CreditsThe credits help you call. Awesome texting app. No inappropriate stuff. No strangers can reach you the only random contact is text me. And you can delete that. BUY THE APP!!!!!!!!!Ã°???Ã°???Ã°???Ã°???Ã°???Ã°???Ã°???
self direction,Use to work great now very poor app,"It worked great when I first installed it about 3 weeks ago then the updates made some parts stop working and it does not always receive texts and can't always send them.I use to be able to see how much credit I had in stock but that feature has also disappeared now.How come updates make things a lot worse, I thought they were meant to make the app better !Not on this app !!"
security,Moresecurity...A Good Thing,"Having an extra step ofsecurity is comforting, especially with all the problems caused by less than honorable people."
self direction,Did not like it,"Installed it on my girl's Kindle. Maybe I misunderstood, but I thought it was a free app that I could use for my kids. After a couple of months, my kids couldn't use it anymore and I got a text from someone asking me who I was. Turns out that the phone # assigned to me from the TextMe app was given to another person for their new cell phone."
power,"Download once, appears in every acct u have",It shows up everywhere.  No control over limits.
self direction,It was like it was 1998 all I had MSN Messenger while ...,Installed it. Tried to use it. Turns out the person I wanted to text also has to have the app on their device. I thought it was just going to let me text message them and they'd receive it normally. Nope. Uninstalled it.It was like it was 1998 all I had MSN Messenger while my friends had AOL again. LOL.
self direction,works really well!,This app has been working really well for me the last texting app I had didn't allow kindles to text anymore so when I found it I thought irt was destiny!and now that I have it I can't stop texting
self direction,Five Stars,"Thought it was""free"", but found out that was only partially true."
power,Not Safe for minors!,To easy for minors to download and circumvent parent controls.  My child almost ran off with a older man she had been talking too.
self direction,Nope,"Says it is free, but the only way to really get it to work is to pay for it with a subscription.  I thought it would be a good thing for my daughter now that she is learning to stay home by herself occasionally. But no.  It really just sucked.  Hard to use. Not worth it at all!"
power,better than amazing!,"i think this app is the best texting app there is! it loads really quickly, and its easy to find out how to control it. you can have as many contacts as you want. the best thing is, its free! you may think a free texting app is going to be bad but its a really good app. its even better than amazing!"
self direction,Doesn't work.,Thought I could use this on my kindle fire. Isn't working.  :(
self direction,i thought it was good but it wasnt,originally i thought this app was great. free texting was awesome with limited calling. in the end i could never watch videos to get more credits and now it refuses to send any texts after only being used for 2 weeks. filling out the surveys and promotions to get credits doesnt work either. this app is garbage.
self direction,Not a safe app,"We were excited to add this app to my daughterÃ¢??s device as a communication tool, but shortly after we downloaded it, inappropriate ads began popping up. Then most recently, a man began texting her using my cell number so she thought it was me. We deleted the app immediately."
self direction,not impressed,"not clear how to use.  (I have texting proficiency).  Thought that it would piggy back off my existing phone number.  I didn't want a second number for people to have to keep up with.  Glad it was free, have already deleted from my kindle"
self direction,Gjfgjfkhgtfhjtfh,Thoughtful
self direction,DO NOT OUT THIS ON CHILDS DEVICE!!,"I put this on my daughters kindle to stay in touch with her during spring break. I thought the ads were annoying but didn't see anything bad. Today she received a  dirty and very disturbing  text and I believe was not an error, but robo text. I I highly advise against allowing children to have this app."
self direction,okay,"I couldn't even get past creating my account , I believe the good reviews are lies"
self direction,...Ã°??Â,"I loved it for a while but when you log out, you loose all your messages/conversations. Also, recently I couldn't text most of the people I want to because I can't receive their texts, I can send them but can't receive. I would also like to be able to see videos that people send me. I thought this would be great because I don't have a phone and its free but its making me angry...so an update or something would be niceÃ°???"
power,Able to Access Porn,We downloaded this app on our son's Kindle but we have Parental Controls on so he cannot access the web browser. Through this app he was able to click on an ad and then access You Tube. He watched pornography through this app. Do disappointing that this app didn't block it AND that the Kindle Fire parental controls didn't block it.
self direction,It's OK.,"It's OK, but the ads pop up underneath the texts, making it look like it WAS a text. I had to ask my friend if she was trying to advertise a hamburger  Ã°?Â? once because I thought that SHE was the one that sent it. It's also really slow, has a lot of ads, will erase people's # after a certain period of time, and all of the things like changing someone's picture, adding more people, etc. is so confusing. Also, you have to pay a fee if you want to constantly remove ads. Otherwise, it's OK."
security,TextMe rocks!!!,"I  wanted this app so that in transitioning between cell phones, or if my one and only cell was for some reason not functioning, lost, etc., I would have some sort of backup for communication. TextMe IS the answer. I have it on my Kindle Fire. It took me a while to get it all figured out, but with some time and patience, I eventually succeeded. It works great. The only down side is that to get it for free, you must use an assigned number. However you can both text AND make calls from your tablet! It gives me greatsecurity to know I have this backup in place."
self direction,really,At first this app was cool. I could call and text for free. But the credits suck. Do not get this app. I have a friend that is going to another school. I was very sad and when I saw this app I thought it was a good way to communicate with her. But it turns out that I was wrong. This app sucks do not get it. I am glad that it was FREE.
self direction,Boss,"This app is AMAZING! (And no, I'm a not making one of those fake reviews) I can text a lot of people at the same timePROSÃ‚Â·Text no matter what device then other person hasÃ‚Â·Isn't a limit on how long or much you TEXTÃ‚Â·You can call and video callÃ‚Â·You can add on stickersCONSÃ‚Â·One word, and yes, this is used in many texting app reviews: CREDITS(But how else are they gonna make money, I don't blame them)The reason I gave this app 4 stars instead of 5 is because one time it logged me out. I couldn't get back in with my account, so I had to make a new account, and I woke up and freaked out my friends because they thought a stalker was texting them. (You have to get a new number)P.S. You can still text without credits for a long time."
self direction,Kindle owner/user.,"My phone was stolen and I thought I was SOL. Thanks to this app, that's not the case. Plus it works I. Kindle!! Highly recommend this app!"
self direction,Nothing is Free,"I hope everyone now realizes that no matter what the claim, NOTHING is free.  That being said I thought I would try this anyway. Downloading time was about 30 seconds. When it wanted me to choose one of their phone numbers I already didn't like it but figured somehow that has something to do with how the app makes money.  Continuing on I entered the info it asked of me including my age which again I decided was for advertising purposes. I was sure I would be bombarded with ads since the app was ""free"".  I sent a text to my son's iPhone first since I was sure he was going to tell me all the reasons why I should've installed this app.  As soon as I sent the text more ads than I could have imagined flooded the page.  I had to search for the text response from my son which simply said ""where did this number come from, what did you do""? Haha!  I decided all this 'free"" wasn't worth it. I uninstalled the app right then.  I do want to text from my Kindle Fire so I'll keep looking for a compatable app where I can hopefully use my own phone number."
self direction,Percy Jackson Annabeth Chase Percabeth,When i downloaded the game i thought it wouldn't be to good but once i got it and started using it started growing on me and all my friends have phones and i cant get one and this makes up for it i can send pictures and video's and texts no problem and u just found out how to do everything and it is awesome so i definitely recommend it i have never got a better app im my life and you get better stuff than just emojis you get huge ones but you cant send regular emojis but other than that the game is the best game everPs sorry this is so long
power,Excellent appÃ°??Â,"The TextMe app is better than Messenger Kids. Messenger Kids was a bit too strict with passwords and parental controls. But when you use Textme, you can add phone numbers without having to put in passwords like Messenger Kids. TextMe is a great app.Ã°???Ã°???Ã°???"
self direction,Amazing,It's awesome!! You can text anybody even if they have a differnet device!!!! Plus you don't need WiFi!! If you are somewhere with no WiFi this app does not contain any! Especially if you don't have the regular messages app or you don't have an Apple and Samsung phone!! Thanks for creating this app now I can text my family and friend wherever I go!! Even if I do not have the same device cause I don't or have the same regular messages app!! Ã°???Ã¢?Âº
self direction,Good *enough*...,"I downloaded this while on a train when my phone was dying so I couldn't text. It worked well enough for what I needed it for. A few points I didn't like...* They didn't specify in the description that I'd get a separate phone number. I don't know how I thought it would work, but somehow I thought it would just work through the wi-fi connection on the Kindle itself. Wishful thinking maybe. Anyway, then from my dying phone, I had to text the number to the two people I wanted to text, since it wasn't entirely user-friendly to know how to start a new text to someone. It takes you straight to inviting your contacts...of which, of course, I had none. I know *now* how to do it, but at first, it was frustrating.* It doesn't alert you when you have a new message. Not easy, then, to be reading your book and know when you have a new message unless you keep checking. (And on the Kindle, unlike my phone that shows what programs I have open, I'm not finding as easy to do - swap between programs. Maybe that's a newbie issue for me.)I don't know if I'll continue to use it in the future; I might end up deleting it. But for that instance it worked well enough."
self direction,It just crashed when I opened it!,I read the reviews and I thought it would be a grate app... but it crashed every time I tried to open it!  I used my Kindle Fire HD to download this app but it crashed. As I've said.  It looks like a great app. And I wish it would've worked.  Still download it to see if you can open it. If your any luckier than I am!
self direction,Errrrrrr,This app won't let me get in with creating a new phone number and I want to use my old one.Ã°???
self direction,It mostlly works,"Its great that you can pick a number from an area code of your choosing but it lags because of incessant ads in your feed pop up ads that are starteling at times if you have a headset onYeah its ""free"" but at the cost of missed text unsent text and constantly hitting pop ups as you try to tap on a name.. But that capitalism."
self direction,What?,I thought it would let me sync my phone and tablet with the same number but it gave you a new one and made you make an account?! How sad! Ã°???
security,Scamming app,"Scammers are using this app. I listed a car for sale on Craigslist and I I have been greeting text scams from different numbers and when I call them back, I get the you have reached your friend on text me. And so forthText me needs to put somesecurity in its app or every legitamate consumer that uses it is in danger of scamming"
stimulation,"The best ""free"" text app I have come across to date!",Super easy to navigate even for a texting rookie like me. Highly recommend for those that may be social media/technically challenged....
self direction,Used to be awesome...  Not anymore,I've been using this app for almost 3 years now.It used to be great but since a few months my phone doesn't ring anymore when a call is coming in!All I get is the notification ring for a MISSED CALL!At first I thought it was my phone.  But I've tried it on 3 different ones since and have the same issue on all of them?!
power,InApickle,"This a great app for emergency situations where you do not have a phone for whatever reason. Also, buying the talking minutes are significantly cheaper than most cell phone plans and other text apps. Great service.The down side to this app has to be the advertisements and low volume control while talking."
tradition,Just Want I Needed and More!,I just started but enjoy it already. I work for a multicultural company where many languages are spoken. I only need/want  to learn the basics of about 5 languages because I would like to make communication easier for everyone especially when it comes to the training process. This program will definitely help me a ton. I also have friends that speak other languages so now I can surprise them.
tradition,Improved.,"It IS in fact, the best product on the market that I have encountered, but the price is quite high -- I found the free app ""Duolingo"" to give it a run for its money for the more commonly taught languages, and there is a lot that can be cobbled together from various sites and YouTube.I had purchased and worked with Rosetta Arabic ! about 10-12 years ago when investigating ""self-instructional"" language programs for students at my university. I found the pedagogy a bit lacking. This year, I took advantage of their ""back-to-school"" half-off sale  and find it much improved -- the on-line version, anyway. The first part of a lesson is an overview of the material, then it is broken down into focusses on discrete skill areas - listening, grammar, reading and writing. Every two weeks, you get a 45-min. session with a tutor via a form of Skype.I haven't investigated the games function yet, since I haven't gotten that far. Like all learning products, it requires self-discipline and motivation,but the pacing of the materials keeps you going.Some, but rather few, of the pictures and graphics are culturally appropriate. I think for verbs and everyday activities, they use the same photos for all the languages."
self direction,It's not free,I thought it was free.  Once I got in the app they wanted $199.  Total bs
universalism,Very effective,I have been able to speedily gain an accurate understanding of the language that I am currently studying through this app. It is very easy to work with an I have experienced little problems with the app. I'm am enjoying my learning experience.
universalism,Fun!,"My only complaint is the writing not being available. True, you can only try a small ""lesson"" free, but what seems to be one lesson is just a quarter of one! I tried the free demo to make sure I would enjoy it and loved it! In some ways it even felt like a game. I did pretty well, so decided to invest in a three month subscription. As soon as I started the second part of the first lesson, BAM! It felt more challenging so I knew I would have to try hard to keep up and pass. I felt like I was really going to be taught the language, even I did have to repeat lessons to understand things. But its fun and learning something like this that I always wanted to learn gives me confidence so I really don't mind! Still, I do wish the writing part was available. I think being able to do it would strengthen my skill and understanding with my new language."
tradition,not what I expected,I was looking for something to refresh my Spanish and this is not it.  It would be good for someone learning for the first time as it has good vocabulary re-enforcement but was to basic and repetitive for my needs. I needed a more traditional spanish class
self direction,great app,"I was impressed with how well the scenarios were thought out. The voice recognition is excellent supports proper pronunciation.  By. The review of the lesson, you are reading, speaking, and understanding the language.  It not just memorization, but an actual understanding of the language."
universalism,deep end,"They toss you in to it, but fairly quickly it gets easier and you find yourself understanding what you are doing as you go on."
universalism,Fun and easy!,The pictures and the repetition make this the easiest way to learn! Instant gratification and understanding! Love it!
self direction,plz fix the unlock - purchase,"I absolutely loved this free app. However, after the free 1/2 hour of level one, you need to make a purchase to unlock the rest of the program - which I was happy to do, but I couldn't  simply purchase the app for my kindle. Instead I was directed to Amazon to purchase the software for my pc. The free app was a terrible and misleading tease. You went to all the trouble of creating a great app, why not allow us to buy it?!!!"
self direction,It is wonderful. I am learning so much more then I ...,It is wonderful. I am learning so much more then I thought I would. My progress in Portugues is improving daily because I am able to use the Rosetta Stone.
self direction,Two Stars,"thought it would be fun, but..."
universalism,Linda,Easy to understand and follow. Gives a better understanding of the sound versus  the spelling of French. I rate this very high because I have tried other apps. Be ready to concentrate with sound and the visualization. It makes you pay attention.
universalism,Has potential to be beneficial,"I was very disappointed to learn that the games option is not available on the mobile app.  I think having at least a basic understanding of the Spanish language would be helpful. It felt like starting a movie in the middle and at first I became frustrated, but eventually I caught on. I got a great deal on a six month subscription. I think if I'd paid full price I would be seeking a refund, but I think I'll keep it. I can see the potential."
self direction,Rosetta stone,I thought it's a very interesting product and I hope to continue using it in the future
stimulation,very pleased,"This lesson challenged not only being able to pick the right picture based on visual clues, but also your ability to pronounce and read the language.  Definitely a worthwhile and fun exercise!"
self direction,Hola,Good to learn and speak a lagueage one thought impossible to learn.
self direction,It's cute but --------,"My purpose in downloading the App  was to gain access to one or both of 2 languages which I already own. I purchased both German & French, all 5 levels of each, several months ago directly from Rosetta Stone and wanted to transfer those to my  7th generation Kindle and if needed uninstall from one of my 2 computers. Even the original purchases from Rosetta Stone were not what I thought they were, Version 4 which I was told took advantage of wide screen laptops. Instead the DVDs were Version 5 which is another name for Version 3. I guess I'll just have to go back to using my Dell or Apple laptop computers and forget about using my Kindle when not at home."
stimulation,Excellent product,I love Rosetta Stone. I have used it in a classroom as an end of class supplement. It is a fun way to challenge yourself and enhance your world with more skills.
universalism,Makes Learning a New Language Easy,"Rosetta Stone really does make learning a new language easy and feels quite natural.The Kindle ap is excellent for learning the sounds, understanding the spoken and written word of a new language.The only real downside I've noted deals with keeping track of plurals, special rules, feminine versus .masculine or neuter and first person, second person, third person usages.  These are there and they are practiced but they are not clearly explained.  A great deal must be inferred.  But then, this is the natural way our babies learn their languages as well.  None the less, after the first few sections, I did pick up an inexpensive grammar book to answer and clarify some of these questions.By the way, Rosetta Stone is NOT free, only the mobile interface application is free.  But  I did not expect Rosetta Stone to be free.  It's a well designed, well presented study program.  I wouldn't expect this level of quality to be free."
self direction,Amazing,"I have been bilingual for seven years. I thought I knew everything, but this showed that I was wrong! I am still learning"
self direction,Seems great so far,I'm comparing this to another language learning app. Seems better to me.  More repetition and real life pictures of objects and actions
self direction,Rosetta Stone,Didn't know that there would be a cost to do anything with this app. They sure did not say so. Thought that we could try it to see if we wanted it.
self direction,Not what I expected.,"I chose Russian and I guess they assume you know anything about the Russian language. Which I did not. Spelling, Pronunciation... its all different. After the first lesson I was very confused. I thought for sure it would cover the basics of the language before going to words and phrases."
self direction,the  app Rosetta Stone,"At first I thought it would take me like a day or two for me to learn,but I am learning other languages in minutes. It's either that this app is a good teacher,or that I am a good student . Either way I am giving this app a four star"
stimulation,Rosetta Course Free,Love it!!! It really challenges you....like the fact you can redo....like to perfect before going on!!! Thank you for helping to bridge the gap without it costing a fortune!!!
self direction,Strange Learning Strategy,I thought rosetta stone was supposed to be the easy way to learn a language. I think I spent more time on the trial trying to figure out what the pictures meant and what it wanted from me on certain screens-directionless!...lmao...I guess it might work for others. Not sure if I'd buy into it.
self direction,love it,love itthis app really was a refreshed for me. kudos to those individuals responsible for creating this app.sincerelyJohnson _
self direction,Can't get it to work,"I was very excited to to have Rosetta on my kindle, because I have it on my lap top and thought it would be so convenient on my kindle, but I can't get it to work."
self direction,"I repeated 'Hola"" a dozen times (and I have been told I have a good accent) and each time was told Incorrect which made ...","First of all, they only give you ONE free lesson!  And the first lesson is the absolutely most basic.  I have studied Spanish in High School and thought myself a later beginner, so I would have to pay the big bucks to get to a challenging level.  Then, their voice recognition feature didn't work for repeating words for proper pronunciation.  I repeated 'Hola"" a dozen times (and I have been told I have a good accent) and each time was told Incorrect which made me feel like a chastised dummy!  Their teaching felt more like punishing instead!"
self direction,french with rosetta,great! easy to learn! never thought speaking French could be so easy!!!! so excited to go to France and use my french now!
universalism,easy to learn,app slowly eases you into learning one step at a time and before you know it you are learning and understanding another language. very awesome!
self direction,Common Sense Teaching,I appreciate learning a new language from action photos. I've always felt that associating a foreign language with your native language is an unnecessary step.
self direction,Annoying Register prompts,"Annoying Register prompts and $ call to action$ to buy$.  Never was able to get to anything that was a language training sample.  Made an account on line, but nothing to try, only to buy$ first."
self direction,Beginner level please,"Um, I felt like this app just started spewing out sentences, full Japanese spellings and all that without starting at the beginning.  I was hoping to start as I were in kindergarten like with what the letters A through Z are and all that.  More importantly, I thought the whole thing was free but I guess only one lesson is free, then they want you to buy lessons.  So, don't bother."
stimulation,Start your day,Love starting my day with a warm coffee and Rosetta Stone. It feels very interactive. The progression from Unit 1 to more advanced lessons really challenges me.
self direction,"It is a good app, but it is expensive to get the ...","It is a good app, but it is expensive to get the lessons that are needed. Mango languages is free, thought not quite as good."
self direction,Excellent.,I'm happy for choosing this software.
tradition,Nobody Does It Better,"I have tried many self-study Japanese language courses but I came back to Rosetta Stone because nobody does it better.  The online course works well in this app, with the exception that the writing lessons are not available through it, and being able to study Japanese on my Kindle Fire HD is very convenient.  If you're serious about language study but don't have the time or opportunity for a traditional language school, I highly recommend Rosetta Stone."
stimulation,Punctuation,"So far so good just on lesson 2.Already speak Spanish,learned in Madrid,Spain.just brushing UP my skills to adventure into the profession of Translation.Ask to soon to rate.I could have declined,too.lol.Very Helpful as well as accurate."
tradition,Pretty good way to learn a language for most people,"Rosetta Stone isn't my favorite way to learn a language, but it is a good one.I need more structure. I'd rather learn by traditional instruction than be learning as a child would learn a language."
self direction,I am really learning a lot from this course.,I never thought I woould detain another language. This xourse has shown me I am not too old to learn Swedish and it has been fun.
self direction,Bon unit et Bon chance,"I have travelled to France five times in the last six years , and although I have enjoyed the trips, I feel I would enjoy my upcoming trip more if I were more fluent in the language.  In the past, I have used Pimsler cd's and various textbooks, but I think Rosetta Stone will be more effective because of the interaction and pronunciation. Ask me in May for an update.  I was hesitant to pay the price, but so far, I think it is worth it."
self direction,useless!,i want to give this a zero rating but amazon wont let me.. i thought it would be a one time payment but it wasnt.. dont use this to learn japanese
self direction,woopie ohhh,First lesson and the complex twist and turns allows for retention. I am eager to continue. I will let you know more as I go deeper into the lessons. Who would have thought it would be so exciting to learn another language.
self direction,Outstanding!!!!!,"HANDS down the best software to not only learn, but truly master any languageYou desire.  Guaranteed satisfaction is what you will get with this product."
self direction,Good learning language tool,Easy and fast and challenging.  I am learning faster than I thought I would and because of this I highly recommend this program!
self direction,Four Stars,It was ok I thought it would be a little more.
self direction,The best I've found.,Very easy to follow and well thought out. As someone who has struggled with other language learning software I can say this one stands out!
self direction,Great for beginners!,Easy to use and easy to learn. Great for beginners and children. Makes learning seem easy and free flowing.  I really feel like I can learn and maybe not struggle as much as I had thought.
stimulation,Awesome tool to help my first year French student.,I am considering buying this program for my 9 th grader. This app is wonderful. It challenged him and built his confidence at the time...it's great.
self direction,Great companion,"This is a fantastic mobile companion to the Rosetta Stone full program. There is enough here that you can test it out to see if this learning system is something you'd enjoy and stick to. I will say that I wish the games were on here too, but you have to use the desktop version to access those. Their complexity and interaction with other players/learners makes that understandable, though."
power,Requires Online Subscription (expensive),"Doesn't just track progress, and show status (which, honestly, would've been enough). Instead, it's access to the full courses. BUT, it requires the online subscription version of the software, the disc version doesn't get you anywhere."
stimulation,Useful and not for the last passive learner,Great app and a true challenge
self direction,Great language learning app!,I like the approach to learning language that Rosetta Stone uses. I teaches you to speak and identify words with their objects or actions first rather than launching you into learning vocabulary and grammar from the start.
self direction,Looking forward to doing my lessons!,"These are words I thought would never come out of my mouth! This is a must have for anyone who wishes to learn another language, I am simply having the time of my life with this! I never knew learning could be this much fun until now. If all leaning was structured like this in school, I would have made the Dean's list everytime! Highly recommended! Try it, and get the word out...and no, I am not sponsored, I am just very happy. This tool is not just all fun and games though ( well....almost not all fun and games ), one must put forth the effort, however, each time you practice, the more comfortable you'll become and interested.The lessons are designed not to intimidate you, but for you to challenge yourself at your own pace, and if you know you didn't do well in a previous lesson, the programs are contructed to make  you want to do better and give it another try.My greatest challenge at the moment is; calming myself down and practicing the proper pronunciation of words to utilize the proper diphthong, however, if one keeps getting them wrong, no stress, take a minute ( or two ), breath, and give it another try, what's really cool is, Rosetta Stone makes it so much fun that even repitition doesn't feel like some arduous and frustrating task like some of the other learning ( parrot-like squaking; ""Polly wants a cracker!"" )  software out there. The price makes you want to scream but, once you give it a try ( I HIGHLY recommend the free trial before putting down your hard earned money ) and decide to buy, you'll know that you have made a wise investment if your intentions really are to learn a new language and speak it with confidence. Good luck!Gabriel"
self direction,Japanese!,"I love learning this way! I never would have guessed that I could actually learn Japanese this late in life but I am! I'm retaining what I've learned and can repeat it to my friends and understand when I hear it out loud from people on the street and in the market. I studied spanish for 6 of my schooling years but I never pick it up well enough for conversation. I'm not there yet with Japanese but I can tell I'm integrating Japanese into my daily thoughts and expressions more than I ever did with Spanish. I realized as I was teaching my granddaughter words in her world (also giving her the Japanese word), I am learning the same way she is learning to speak English.Great program!"
self direction,One Star,"After downloading it, signing up and choosing a language, it shuts down. I couldn't even use it!"
self direction,5 stars,This app is incredibly helpful! I'm glad I got it. At first I thought there was probably a catch but no!
universalism,Hola  hello,Very well put together program. I am understanding with the greatest of  ease. Thank Rosetta Stone Adios
self direction,Good Tool for Continuing Rosetta Stone Study While on the Road,"The Kindle Tablet instance of the Rosetta Stone Totale course is a good replication of the web-based tool. It allows full access to the various course and studio capabilities EXCEPT the Kindle Fire will not support student interaction in Speaking mode. Thus, a student can read and interact in writing or via menu selections with the course material, but can not speak with instructors or use the Totale voice recognition software to assess speaking progress. This can be an issue if the stiudent wishes to practice portions of the course that involve speaking."
self direction,Greedy. Not worth your time.,"I got this app on my kindle since DuoLingo the app I normally use, wasn't available and thought wow this app is amazing! I learned alot of French for the beginning of the first level and it said I had to purchase more and I was like ok I bet it's just like $5.00 and I'll just pay and learn French. BUT NOOOO. It was freaking 209$! Just for the first five levels! And there's 20! I was not about to learn French for 800$! I just decided to use DuoLingo on my phone because OH MY GAWD this app is greedy. It's a really good learner and I could learn French easily if it was free or ALOT less. If your not ready to pay $800 to learn a language, leave this app alone! It is not worth your time!"
self direction,TED MIA,"This is a tough one.  What to review: the series?; or the Ã¢??appÃ¢?Â?  The series is what it is: intriguing, thought-provoking (some say Ã¢??controversialÃ¢?ÂÃ¢??when did controversy become a pejoritive term?  IsnÃ¢??t the First Amendment a formal endorsement of controversy?).  But what about the app?  First of all: why an app?  Why is it not just a folder of videos to select from?  ....?  But it is an app.  As an app, it suxÃ¢??bronto.  It worked great when we downloaded it.  Look at all those videos!, in all those categories!  Next day: nada.

self direction,TED succumbed to its success,"It used to be something special, to sit down and watch some of the most fascinating lectures on many a subject. Today, it has become a forum for product placement and half-thought-out ideas, soft-science and anyone who *thinks* he/she can do as well as the great first adopters of this great idea.

power,It's easier to curse the darkness than light a candle.,"Do you know someone that seems to know something about everything? You know, someone always able to provide an interesting slant on the moral issues surrounding new technologies and the old problems they're solving. The first person to know about things beyond the cutting edge, who shares with you what Bill Gates, Stephen Hawking, or President Clinton think about issues facing the world. I can tell you something about that person: They know TED.TED is my daily moment of Zen; it's salt for the world, adding flavor to everything it touches; it's conference around the world discussing local issues that have, or will have, global influence; it represents the modern view of knowledge, that only by sharing and collaborating can we achieve the impossible, know the unknowable, where we can, as Aaron Sorkin wrote, look into the face of God.Lofty words.That is the TED spirit. Brilliant, talented, funny people that are experts, or often creators, in their field. You can watch Sergey Brin demonstrate Google Glass, Sir Ken Robinson telling you about how to save your child from schools (I'm a teacher, so no complaints), listen to Stephen Dubner prove working at McDonald's pays better than dealing drugs, or Mike Rowe sharing how important, and thankless, are Dirty Jobs. Musicians, artists, doctors, lawyers, politicians, authors, scientists... The list goes on and on. The topics cover, well, everything. I can't even begin to list the subjects that come readily to mind, just listing my favorites would take a page or two.Someone once said ignorance was bliss; today ignorance is criminal. Issues are facing the world that will affect humanity; some good, some bad, but all coming. Many of these issues require citizen involvement, which requires citizens to be familiar with the issues involved, which means, I suppose, if you want to be a good citizen of the world you must watch TED.I promise this: If you watch at least three episodes, they have a YouTube channel also, and you don't find yourself looking for more that interest you, then I will work hard to get a full refund for you (they're free).So what have you got to lose except some ignorance (remember, ignorance means you just don't know; if you've had the chance to learn something and you didn't, that's stupid)."

self direction,It will help you to learn to read Spanish. Listening and speaking requires more than this.,"Duolingo is a great program. I have been learning with it for just over two years now (I upgraded to the Pro version) and by studying at home, with just Duolingo, I am now able to read some Spanish novels, read some magazines and newspapers, and I have a general understanding of the language.But ... if you really want to converse with others, you will need more than this to do that. When I listen to Spanish TV or music or a movie, I""m lost. I have Spanish speaking friends and if they speak slowly, I will understand but in order to respond, it will take me too much time to think about how to properly frame the response. If I were asked to write down my response, I could do that more easily than speaking.My point is, this is an excellent program and I enjoy using it and feel accomplished. But, to truly learn the language, you will need interaction with others who are fluent in the language.Let this get you started and, if you find yourself enjoying it, get a tutor, take a Spanish class, or travel and do some immersion learning. As you're taking lessons, Duolingo will help along the way.Great things about DuoLingo -** It has an active discussion group, so if you're confused about an answer, just click and you'll likely see 100's of posts about that issue.** It has a dictionary so that you can find words that are not part of your lesson** As you learn words, it adds them to your personal word list and shows you when you last used that word so that you can practice vocabulary that you might have not used in a while.** You can read stories that are based on your reading level; it is not just grammar.** The Android version is very easy but I prefer to use it on my laptop or Kindle. Fortunately, Duolingo has platforms for all as well as iOS.** It lets you set your own pace and will remind you daily if you've met your goal for the day. You can change the time you spend per day whenever you like.** Duolingo has a podcast as well which is good to practice your listening skills. It may be too advanced, but it's still good to help you learn the flow and tone of the language.I deducted one star because many people will think this IS the answer, when in fact it is only a part of the answer. The program also has a bit of trouble with voice recognition but then, it might be that my Brooklyn accent does not translate well into proper Spanish."
universalism,BEST free app ever!,I have been using this app for the past few months and it really works! I find myself understanding parts of conversations in Spanish when I'm out in stores or flipping through Spanish television stations. It's very simple and fun. More like playing a game than a tedious language lesson. The best part is I'm actually learning! I can't believe this amazing tool is free! Now there is no reason not to be multi lingual!
self direction,fun way to learn a new language,"My 1st grader wanted to learn a new language, a friend told me about Duolingo, thought I'd give it a try. I started doing it to stay ahead of him so I could help him if he needed it. Now my 5th grader is doing it to. We are having funny using our new language skills together. Bottom line it can help at a by age.My only 2 critiques would be, a better reward system to keep kids interested. Maybe a reference area to explain a little about how the words are formed to have a better understanding.That being said it is a Free app, so it is great!"
self direction,Duolingo is an excellent language app,"Duolingo is an excellent language app! It covers listening, writing, reading and speaking. You complete excercises at your own pace.  It also  enables you to redo parts of already completed sections to refresh the vocabulary and grammar you have learnt. It is the best language course I have ever come across.It allows you to listen again to sections to be translated as many times as you want before translating. When you mouse over a word, the English is displayed so this helps you translate when you are stuck on a word you don't know. It also lets you learn  different languages at the same time on the one app just by switching the language at the push of a button! You are awarded ""lingots"" after completing each section which is an incentive to continue as you can buy different additional bonus sections with them. This is a really well thought out language course and to top it all it was a free app! well worth 5 stars!"
universalism,sooo easy!,"My love of  Italian music prompted my learning the language.  I'm so glad I found this program!  Now I find myself singing along and understanding a lot of it already after only a few lessons!  The program is really easy and fun at the same time, making understanding of the language just fall into place!  My son now uses it and I have it on every device I have! Love, love, love it!!!"
universalism,Great APP,"Duolingo is such a great app for language learning that exposes you to a variety of languages.However, while playing on Duolingo, it is VERY important to remember to also use materials to supplement your learning! Just using Duolingo and nothing else won't help you much with understanding grammar. In addition, I would also recommend you to use the web version as much as possible! The mobile version is slightly easier than the web one because writing out a sentence is just tapping words. :)Have fun!"
self direction,"this is the greatest app ever conceived. no, really tho.","this is an a amazing app and I'm so glad SOMEONE finally had the good thought that paying at least $500 to teach yourself a language is ridiculous. ive done Rosetta stone and this is not only comparable,  but better. it gives you ""lingots"" as prizes for doing perfect on quizzes, and then you can use those to buy stuff for your character,  or even bonus lessons I already speak Spanish,  I learner it inhigh school andill admit,  I'm really good at language. but you don't have to be to use this thing. I also like that it keeps track of your progress on a graph. it makes me want to study harder and harder each day so I get more XP than I did the day before. it truly is an amazing little tool. I work as a receptionist and I study with this app probably about 4 hours a day. I think to learn a language effectively,  you really have to do it everyday. right now, i'm teaching myself Portuguese. I plan to work my way through all the romance languages."
self direction,Great App,"I'm surrounded by bilingual, Spanish speaking people, and I thought it was time I made the effort to learn Spanish.  Simple, easy to use, app. My favorite part is, I can go back and repeat a lesson, for a refresher or if I think I've done badly. Pictures to help you learn, voice commands, and sentence structures. It's fun too Ã°???"
self direction,Not Working,Tried to log-in with my kindle 7. I thought it was a problem with my password but then I changed my password and I still can't log in. So it must be the app itself.
self direction,I'm addicted. Get this now!,"Duolingo rocks my socks. I'm learning German and picked up more in two weeks than I did from taking a whole 4 years of Spanish back in High School. The progression of learning is perfect to me, if I get lost I go back and review. I have this on my phone, PC and tablets so wherever I go I am constantly using this. I'm addicted! Oh, the real kicker, free! No adds, no gimmicks, no stopping your progression and make you buy more content, just free and well thought out and designed language learning!"
tradition,Convenient Language Study,Nice and convenient way to begin to study a foreign language or brush up on language of your heritage. I wouldn't claim it as a complete source of study but I would compare it to a cellphone camera. The best camera that you have is the one that you have at the time you need it.
self direction,effective and fun,"I tried to learn Spanish with Rosetta Stone years ago on my pc. I remember getting bored with it within a couple of weeks because it frustrated me. At first I thought that it made sense to learn a new language as a child does, with image and word association. After using it I realized that, as an adult, I wanted to know what the words I was learning meant, not just memorize what noise goes with each image.I don't mean to put Rosetta down, it's worked for a lot of people for a long time. But, Doulingo, in my opinion is much better. Aside from it not costing me anything, it also makes more sense to me to learn a language the way Doulingo teaches it. Instead of learning some words and very phrases over a 3-4 week period (as I did with Rosetta), I have actually learned many more words and longer phrases, and can put them together to say things that are relevant and useful!Also, the the presentation, rewarded skill points, and notifications really help keep me engaged. If feels like a game as much as an educational app. (I wish Spanish 1 & 2 in H.S. had been this fun). My 10 year old enjoys it too. We downloaded it for her ipad, friended each other, and now can track each other's progress and compete.The only issue I've had is occasional freezing on my Kindle Fire HDX 7&#34; and have to restart it. It seems to happen when I'm using a slower WiFi connection than my home network (like my mobile hotspot). Still a five star app in my book. I think I'll learn German after I'm finished with EspaÃƒ?Ã‚Â±ol. Ãƒ?Ã‚Â¡Gracias Duolingo, es muy bien!"
self direction,An excellent learning tool,"I would have given this a 5 but for the fact that sometimes words are introduced and not translated and the user has to guess what the translation is until later on.  I wonder how they thought you were supposed to know what that word means when it never was introduced with a translation before asking the user to translate it.  Anyway, this is a fun and entertaining way to learn words and phrases in another language."
universalism,very pleased,"Very good app. I had some knowledge of Spanish, which was helpful in understanding the structure of the Italian language as as Duo Lingo presented the lessons. We are taking a trip to Italy soon and this has been a great app to learn the basics.  You hear, write, and speak in each lesson. Highly recommended."
universalism,"Well, it is free","Downloaded this free app to brush up on Spanish (that I studied {badly} in college for two semesters).  The lessons are short and easy to digest, but lack the sort of foundation necessary to learn a new language.I understood verb conjugation before opening this app; had that not been the case, this method may have proved exasperating.  In word matching vocabulary drills, the word ""eat"" pairs as a correct response to all of the following: como (I eat), comes (you {familiar} eat); come (you {formal} eat; comemos (we eat); comeis (you plural {familiar} eat); and comen (you plural/they {formal}) eat.  A more helpful approach would have been to match ""I eat"" with ""como,"" ""we eat"" with ""comemos,"" etc.Showing, not telling is the process used by Duolingo.  Unfortunately, forms of speech are presented without the most basic explanation that is essential to understanding a new language."
stimulation,This is an AMAZING game,So cool pick any language you want to learn and learn the basics to it then food and sayings it is just great for helping with country transfers and  school learning even though I am not in the school that teaches languages or a country transfer it is so fun and everything is a challenge and I personally love challengesSo please check out this game
self direction,I would love if more photos were used,I'm enjoying the app. It's daily reminders keep me consistent. I appreciate being able to go over the previous lessons. I would love if more photos were used. I'm a visual learner and seeing a photo of the action that is occurring assists me with my retention. I.e. They are eating photo of a group of people eating. The children are eating photo of children etc.
stimulation,I've enjoy the application for the different learning levels,"So far, I've enjoy the application for the different learning levels. It's a nice plus to connect with other that can ""challenge"" you in pursuit of achieving more in desired language. Not sure if one likes that it does the constant reminders of practice time, but sure every good application has ways of modifying things."
universalism,Highly recommended,"I have numerous books an have taken classes in the States and Central America and I feel this is a fun and engaging way to study Spanish. The combination of writing, reading, and speaking is important to really understanding the language. My current instructor is a native of Guatemala and provides my classes via Skype. He noted the improvement in my pronunciation and confidence speaking after using this program. I occasionally disagree with some of the translations but reading the comments has taught me a lot. Great language program!"
universalism,Don't waste your money on something else.,"This is about the best imaginable app for what it does. I think it would be great if it had more languages (I.e. Mandarin, Aramaic, Arabic, Yiddish, Latin, Ancient Greek, Elfin, etc.) Using this helps a lot with reading, writing and understanding the chosen language. I am thoroughly satisfied with this app and look forward to any improvements. Thank you."
self direction,Duolingo a good way to learn a language.,This has been quite a surprise.  I thought maybe I could learn just a few words to help me when I travel but was happy to see that not only do I learn what can help me there but words that will help me converse with my gardner for example.  Although he speaks English he is more comfortable with Spanish and it gives me a chance to practice.  If you use the mic  you get feed back on how you sound when you speak and if you are pronouncing the words correctly.  You can't beat the price when companies that teach languages can charge hundreds of dollars.  I also like the convenience of having this on my Kindle so I can learn and practice whenever I want.  The only drawback that I can see is that they have a limited number of languages that you can learn at this time.
stimulation,Better than Rosetta Stone,"My favorite app. I regret buying rosetta stone... Rosetta stone does not allow you to use the app unless your paying extra every month. And their system is boring. In the other hand, Duolingo keeps you on your toes with daily challenges. And their owl is pretty cute."
universalism,Exciting,"This app is great, I am so excited to see if I can start understanding Spanish speaking people,and then be able to speak to them. I am 7 levels in and when we drive down the street, I can read the Spanish stores and know what it says, Exciting. The only thing I think would be better to know in the beginning is the numbers, alphabet, and how to pronounce them."
stimulation,Fun Learning,"This app makes it fun to learn a language.  It has short lessons that help you to understand conversational Italian (my language of choice, but several others are offered). The lessons are well organized and build upon one another.  The format allows the student to have success, which makes you want to continue the process.  Since the format is similar to a game, it challenges you to go to the next level.  I also like the review process that allows you to go back to previous lessons. I'm currently on Level 3 so I don't know how comprehensive the entire program will be, but it definitely appears it will give you a very good foundation in a new language.  The only criticism I have is that the native speaker is sometimes hard to understand and I have to listen to her several times to make sure of pronunciation.  However, that is becoming less of a problem as I become more accustomed to her voice."
universalism,Great design!,"I loved how this app built on previous lessons to teach grammar through use. I've been on the verge of true fluency in spanish for many years; reading and dreaming but never able to catch more than a few words in conversation or being able to speak. Duolingo was the perfect app for stitching everything together into a comprehensive whole. I've always struggled with grammar in spanish, and this app helped me develop a subconscious understanding. The only complaint I have is that there weren't formal grammatical sections. It would be nice to have lessons strictly on conjugation that I could practice."
self direction,Great Way to Learn New Languages,"I've actually not tried this out on my Kindle Fire yet, but I thought it would be a good idea to have it on there, just in case. I do have this app on my iphone though. I've found that it's a LOT easier and more motivating to use this app on mobile devices than it is to do it on the computer. Don't get me wrong, the website/computer version is good and well, but can be a little cumbersome. The app, if you've installed the right keyboards, which I don't think is very difficult (easy on the iphone, not sure about the Kindle yet. It was a Christmas present so I still am figuring it out), it changes automatically to the keyboard you need for each section of the lessons. I'm currently taking several languages, and it's nice to have the proper keyboard, a specified layout, and frankly, a whole lot less hassle.The downside is that the app takes longer to get the site updates. It took about a month for the app to acquire Russian for English speakers after the website launched it. If you don't mind that, then there isn't much of an issue, aside from actually learning the languages, which can be challenging enough, depending on the language and dedication you choose."
self direction,Using it 32 consecutive days & counting! Need prior knowledge! You will learn spelling and grammer! But doesn't explain/teach!,"Over 20 years ago, I lived in Italy for 4 years (not consecutive) and had several group lessons but despite the efforts of my various instructors, I just didn't have the patience to learn the grammar.  My knowledge of vocabulary was good enough for me to communicate and function but I never could get the hang of conjugating verbs, learning about the articles, and spelling words properly.  Later lived in Latin America for 4 years and that messed up my language skills big time!  So, now I speak both languages very poorly - just throwing out words to make a mishmash sentence.  A couple years ago I went back to Italy and they asked me if I could speak english because they couldn't tell if I spoke Spanish, Italian or some unknown language!  (Note: My native language is American English)So, I'm returning to Italy again for a 2 week vacation and I'm determined to be better this time and not embarrass myself.  So, I got Duolingo on Feb 20th and believe it or not, I'm truly addicted to the program!  I have a full time job and when I come home I'm tired and yet, every single day, I spend 1 hour to 2 hours working on these mini lessons from Duolingo!  Funny, they are kind of addictive.  They force you to learn the language by making you hear the language, speak the language, interpret the phrase back and forth between languages, to spell it properly, and put it in the correct order.  If you do it wrong more than 3x then, it kicks you out of the lesson and makes you start over, but the lesson is different the next time around.  Now, you would think one would get discouraged, I mean, I've had to redo some lessons about 6x, and yet, somehow, the way it is structured, it makes me want to keep at it and do it right!  I mean it is working on me, one of the most stubborn learners!So there are a multitude of topics at every level (beginning/intermediate/advanced) and within each topic they have 4-8 different minilessons in each topic.  It visually has a graph that shows you where you are at.  And, even when you think you are done with a topic (whew), every couple of days, that topic reopens and they make you practice it again so you don't forget!  Wow!  So, even with my background knowledge/vocabulary of Italian, I'm still at the very end of the beginners (Level 8; 335 words!) and I've been working hard for a month!  Oh, another downer is I was working on it for 12 days and suddenly it reset and told me I was back on day 1.  I thought it did that every 12 days but now it says I'm at 16 days. (IF ANYONE READS THIS FROM DUOLINGO; I WANT IT RESET TO FEB 20TH THAT I'VE DONE IT EVERY SINGLE DAY!).The downside is that if you have never ever studied a latin language this would be super hard for you.  I think if you already know a similar language like spanish and how it is structured, it will be easier for you.  However, if you are a person who has never studied a romance language and absolute beginner that only knows Ciao, etc..and hever had a lesson, then, you will have a hard time.  Also, if you are a miserable speller in your native language, learning to spell Italian will kill you because it is so difficult to get all of the vowels in the right place.  I have many times translated a very complicated sentence from english to Italian, only to get it counted wrong cuz I misspelled 1 letter!  But, it forces me to really think what I'm writing and how it all comes together to form a complete sentence.  Also, it really doesn't teach you the vocabulary or the grammar rules, at all.  I kept failing the lesson because I wasn't sure what some articles meant because they seem to mean different things at different times.  Yesterday, I finally broke down and got a grammar book so I can look up what all of the articles mean.  So, this program works for people who are already familiar.  I'm worried that when I get in the more immediate level, I might need to study before using this as it isn't really a good teacher - doesn't explain or introduce new concepts.  Good for people that really want to tighten up what they already know and go farther."
self direction,"Easier to use than Rosetta Stone, and free!","I am using this app to brush up on Spanish (learned 30 years ago) and German (picked up from my German family, but never studied formally).  I don't know how it would work for a language you were never exposed to before, but for brushing up purposes it is excellent.  You can easily test out of what you already know and focus on the areas that are weaker.  I also like that you are working on so many skills at once--from fairly passive translation (choosing from a list of English words), to straight translation in both directions, plus dictation and oral practice.  I mainly use it on my Kindle but also have it on my android phone.  Many thanks/muchas gracias/vielen Dank to the developers for keeping it free and ad-free!  Hoping they will add Russian to the list."
self direction,A great app for learning a new language,"This is a great app for learning a new language. It's entertaining and I've learned far more than I ever thought I would. I'm not very good with picking up new languages, so if this app was able to teach me then it can teach anyone."
universalism,Fun and challenging,"A girlfriend of mine and I are going to Europe later this summer, and I wanted to brush up on my French as she is fluent in German. It has been a great refresher course. I started out by trying to test out of some of the common phrases and found that I needed work on some of my tenses and grammar. The game utilizes both English and French (German, Italian or Spanish, depending on which language you choose to learn) words and sentences along with your device's built-in microphone to have you practice saying some phrases yourself. (This function can be turned off. If you're in a noisy, crowded place or don't want to be overheard.)The program, breaks down the learning of the language in much the same way as Rosetta Stone. That is to say that unlike your high school language teacher, you're not just learning active verbs or inactive verbs or pronouns in each lesson. You are learning phrases and how to build conversational structures.A couple of words of caution, however.The app assumes you have a basic understanding of the language you're learning. For example, I have a high school level knowledge of French, and this is been an excellent refresher course and brought back much of what I learned in school. However, when I switched over to try and learn a few German phrases so that I could be just as helpful on our trip, I found it more difficult and challenging to to engage with the program. That isn't to say, that someone could just try to pick up a language (for instance, I'm also working with the Italian section of the app. So when we go through Italy, I'll have some knowledge of the language.Second, the app won't let you advance to the next segment until you can complete the first without four or five errors per segment. Although it's not, strictly speaking, concerned with spelling as long as you're in the neighborhood, it will deduct points if you consistently spell something wrong or don't use the right accent over a letter.Overall though, I have really enjoyed using this and would recommend it to someone who wants to brush up on a language or learn key phrases in order to travel."
universalism,one may be better able to read the language but speaking or understanding ...,"I think that it would be difficult to learn a language the way Dualingo is presented.  Words are introduced  tasking the learner to translate the word......so must guess what the word is and find out meaning by failing.  At the end, one may be better able to read the language but speaking or understanding the spoken language not so.much."
universalism,Get this app!,"Was turned on to this by my younger sister and I am now addicted. I have taken Spanish for 12 years, and this app has helped me strengthen my ability in not only speaking the language, but understanding it spoken at a normal rate. It's a lot of fun, too! Whether you are looking to learn a language, or to just looking to do something in your spare time, I highly recommend this app!"
self direction,it's a pretty good app,"I wish my Kindle Fire had a microphone. I can't use the conversational parts of this app. Otherwise, it's a pretty good app. It might be better if at some point it took you through the alphabet and how accents and pronunciation works (for Spanish). It's an easy system and I've always thought knowing that was helpful."
self direction,Japanese,"I am trying to learn Japanese, and I thought this would help me. Sadly when I opened it I saw it wasn't there. But it was great for the languages it does have! Therefore I am giving it 5 stars. I sure hope Japanese will be included in the next update."
stimulation,fun n easy,i love this program! the way it teaches you language is fun and easy and a bit of a challenge. i mean you get to learn to read write (type) and speak a language all at once. and this was waaaay more affordable than rosetta stone and probably works the same way. DONT EVER TAKE THIS AWAY! i would be very upset because i love this program so much. one suggestion though: add more languages
self direction,me gusta,"Duolingo is fun.  I took Spanish way back in high school and thought it time to refresh.  Duolingo provides a great experience allowing you to hear, speak, read and write in the language of choice.  In addition it offers an opportunity to share the experience with others."
self direction,Great Tool,"Duolingo is the most motivating language course I've ever seen.  It feels like a game, and is designed to keep you moving forward.  It is also concise and surprisingly comprehensive.  Each part has a lesson to read at the beginning, and if you don't understand why you got an answer wrong, there are discussion boards for each and every question.  So far I have not had a question I could not get the answer to, and I am almost halfway through.  I especially like how it encourages me to go back and strengthen skills in constant review.  This ensures that what I learn will eventually get written in my long term memory, its just a matter of time and consistency.  Anybody who uses Duolingo frequently, consistently, and for a long period of time (at least a year) will learn a new language.  Go ahead and get the answers wrong as often as you need to.  The algorithms are designed to program the human brain and you will eventually find yourself getting answers right in spite of yourself, even if you don't quite understand the grammatical principles behind it all.  Duolingo is built on principles of positive reinforcement, making it easier to persevere.  I use it in conjunction with short stories written in the language I'm trying to learn, and movies also in the language with English subtitles.  In only a month, I am understanding so much morevthan I ever thought possible.  I can't believe its free.  Its better than programs I've paid good money for."
self direction,Great for Starting a New Language,"Duolingo is great for starting a new language - especially Spanish or French. Great variety of languages too. Once you finish the skills tree you have to keep up the language through independent study (books, movies, conversations)."
self direction,Easy and fun!,I love Duolingo! It's so easy and fun to use! Hardest part is choosing which language(s) to do.
stimulation,Fun to Practice!,I really like the way this app varies presentation and gives immediate feedback.  The daily challenge is a gteat way to keep motivated.  Only suggestion:  I wish there was a way to also look up a word - sometimes I want to compare the ending of a verb with different pronouns to see/hear/study (or to look and compare female versus male nouns. ). Otherwise great app.
self direction,Go Duolingo!,"This is an awesome app! I knew 45 words in Spanish in two weeks, so I totally thought I'd impress my Spanish teacher because school was starting soon. Sadly, I didn't make it into Spanish, but I'm continuing improving my Spanish with this app. I now know, according to Duolingo, 85 words. I'd recommend this app to all who need to know a language in a short amount of time."
stimulation,"A  fun,go to learning tool .","This is just fun, and of course a learning tool. Although I am a fair Spanish speaker, it never hurts to practice and challenge myself so I keep trying things that might improve my fluency. This will definitely go into my frequently used digital tool box.  It can be used any time , and anywhere, and i find myself using it at least once a day."
stimulation,Best app I have ever purchased!,This has been a huge improvement in my language learning! The quality is great and it is FREE! I prefer this over my Rosetta Stone software which was super de duper expensive. It is fun and there are challenges and I can even challenge my husband to a dual. Great App and I recommend it to everyone. I am learning Italian and the app is just fantastic.
stimulation,Learning with angles,"Nice system, impressively multilayered, with solid native speakers.  I like the reinforcing tasks, and the challenges in spelling and pronunciation.  As a multilingual fellow, I use it to polish my skills and cross-check all my languages. Only gap---have a book at your side to fill in gaps, and for technical points.Recommended!"
universalism,Great App,"Duolingo is a great way to gain an intermediate understanding of a language for free. However some basic knowledge of verb conjugation and grammar is required for most to fully understand the lessons, but this can be acquired for free online from places like youtube etc. Also Duolingo can be a useful supplementary app if you are learning a particular language at school. I started Duolingo when I started taking Spanish classes at school and noticed a big positive change in my understanding of the language. Unfortunately for now only a few European languages are offered. It would be nice to see other languages like Mandarin,Hindi,Arabic, and Swahili as well. Fix this and I will give Duolingo the full five stars this exemplary language learning program deserves."
stimulation,"Fun, easy and convenient.","This app is fun, even when you are dabbling in more than one language at a time. I have been playing with it for awhile and have figured out most of the hints, but it took awhile. It would be nice if there were more directions on all the help that it offers along the way. I recommend it to several friends and family, including the kids. We challenge each other with the points. And my husband is quite entertained with everyone's attempt at pronunciation."
stimulation,Learn Italian,"I totally enjoy this app.  It's fun and keeps you on your toes.  When you get something right, it's time to celebrate.  It challenges you to use your brain to think and transpose Italian to English and English to Italian.  That's the best way to learn, I think.  I plan on spending a lot of time with this app and feel that Duolingo will help me learn Italian."
self direction,Great app!,My sister in law is bilingual and so I thought I'd try to learn a little bit of her language. This app is amazing and has made me relearn what I've forgotten since high school. Maybe soon I can have a full conversation with her and her side of the family! Lol
self direction,Keeping the mind active,I am 72 yes old and learning French.  I never took French in school so it is a challenging subject to keep my mind active.  It really gives you a chance to learn all aspects  of the language at your speed.  You can go back and redue your steps so you don't forget what you thought you had learned.  Who knows I may go to France someday.
stimulation,Addictive language learning,"Admittedly, I am a language geek. But I have been coming back to this app over and over since getting a Kindle for Christmas to learn Italian, and my 11-year-old daughter has been enjoying learning French. It turns language acquisition into a game with new challenges and rewards at each level. Typical challenges include speaking into a microphone, filling in missing words, and typing in sentences that are dictated or written in the other language. It's a little frustrating to have to type accurately in the target language, though."
self direction,Excellent,"I use duolingo to teach English to Mexican kids.  I also introduced a friend, a retired Mexican pediatrician, to the program. He thought he could not learn English, but in just a few months he can carry on a conversation.  I use the Spanish course and it is perfect for my needs.  My friend is 75 years old, I am 68 years old, and my kids are 8, 10, and 11 years old, proof that the program works for all ages."
self direction,Great learning tool,This makes learning fun. The repetition and interaction between languages really helps. I like use of sentences that are practical and useful for everyday conversation. Thanks
stimulation,Das ist gut!,"I love love love this app! It is super fun, and challenges me on many levels. The app helps me translate English to German and vice versa. I also learn grammar and vocabulary in a fun way. The best part for me is using the microphone where I must put my German pronunciation to the test. There's no cheating here! Try this. You will love it. I've tried many different ways to learn German, but this one is the stickiest. Have fun!"
stimulation,Revolutionary. Has room to improve.,"Great app! This is an evolutionary way to learn new languages. It drives you with gaming features and makes your progress visible and shareable. Great for adult learners who are able to extract concepts from examples.I have been using this app to learn all languages  supported, and it has been a great  linguistic adventure. I wish it had more consistent paces across languages so I could compare and contrast the same unit in each language.Not 5 stars because of occasional content errors and synthesized pronunciation. Also, providing a lexicon and/or some other sorts of summarization of what had been covered would help me review."
self direction,Fun & Encouraging Language App,"In retirement, my husband & I are traveling more extensively, often to Europe. I studied Spanish & German in high school 50 years ago. I chose Duolingo to brush up on Spanish. After completing some of the early levels, I thought I could complete some of the early levels in Italian to prepare for an upcoming trip to Italy. Duolingo is fun & easy to use even for me. I am one who doesn't learn languages easily. I hope my 8 & 10 year old grandsons might have interest to learn alongside me."
stimulation,Best language tool,"I do have some experience in languages (Air Force language school, Rosetta Stone, text books etc.), and while no app can replace having multiple native speakers all day every day (the Air Force language school), this one is solid. My daughter challenged me to try it briefly, and I'm on a 815-day streak! (and downloaded it for my newer Kindle). It only takes a few min a day, it does good to encourage and challenge you, and while it's imperfect, I think it works to just oversimplify the grammar at first, then differentiate it as you learn. You can also choose from a large variety of languages (so I've tried some others for fun), as well as reverse it (i.e., learn English as a native speaker of the other language), which adds to your learning (since instructions are in your actual target language and some of the specific vocab is different."
self direction,Great App!,"Great, my problem is I can't access all of the features I've seen other people use. I thought it was because I have a tablet sort thing and the people who had the things I want were using phones, but my sister can't either and she's using a phone. So I don't know what's wrong."
self direction,Fun way to rediscover a language,"I speak Spanish pretty well.  The Spanish version is kind of fun but is not advanced enough to improve my Spanish.  I tried the French version because I learned French in school and it really got me back into speaking because it reminded me of things I already knew but forgot.  I thought Italian would be easy because it's similar to Spanish.  I at least learned that it is not as similar as I thought.  I don't know if I could really learn to speak Italian this way.  I believe to really learn a language, you need to speak it every day."
universalism,Makes learning Spanish easy,"I love the intuitive nature the program uses--it works the same way we learn language as children.  You build your vocabulary slowly, while teaching you how to communicate in the new language. All that, AND its free!"
self direction,Duolingo makes learning a new language enjoyable.,For me there is not better way to learn a new language than to have conversational interaction.  Duolingo makes that happen and in such an enjoyable way!  I truly feel that I am finely grasping the understanding of my new language and will be able to use it when traveling.  Thank you Duolingo.  You're the best!
self direction,Great app for learning.,I absolutely love using this app. I have been trying to really learn and retain Spanish and this app has helped me so much. It starts out with stuff I kinda already know then moves forward to all kinds of levels and subjects that I thought I wouldn't learn. I HIGHLY recommend for teaching children different languages. It is fun.
self direction,Highly recommended for beginners  to intermediate learners,"Love this program. I tried 3 others before finding Duolingo. It is easy to use, includes grammar, pronunciation, recreating the language in writing and verbal feedback. I've learned more in 2 weeks with this program than I did in 6 months at a formal school that cost a bundle. Love it."
self direction,Perfect for self paced learning,"This could complement class room learning, or used completely by itself.It is nice that, at least for me attempting to learn Spanish, that the accents are forgiven to my English keyboard. Also that when using the microphone it is somewhat forgiving to my improper English dialects.It seems to encourage natural learning in many ways. It is kinda hard to explain. The system seems to really utilize my strengths to encourage continual involvement. While simultaneously reiterated over my weaknesses until they become strengths. Using the 'workout' part of the app best shows this routine in action.It is particularly convenient that the learning includes hearing and reading as well as speaking and writing. This helps emphasize the understanding gained of the language. (At least, this is the case with Spanish for me.)Having a desire to give back for those whom made this resource available, especially without financial costs or advertisements, it was noticeable that it is not even possible to donate through the app. This is appropriate for being a true educational resource.After just a few days use it is without doubt they now have my support as I am to provide."
universalism,Easy. Fun. Highly recommended,"This is fun.  Repeating verbs, nouns, pronouns, articles in quick order, using multiple methods ( multiple choice, fill in the blank, translate, repeat)  has the user understanding quicker than had she just been reading vocabulary lists or conjugating verbs."
self direction,Just start,I've been using duo lingo for two weeks now about 20 minutes a day. I never thought I could learn a language after one very disappointing semester of college French but I'm very excited about the progress already. I think I might like to see Belize!Ã°??Â´
self direction,Very easy to use!,This is fun to use. I am learning quicker than I thought I would. I like how you hear the way a sentence should sound and then you get to repeat it back. If there's a of of back ground noise the microphone lesson will not work. It's a great app to learn spanish.
stimulation,Fun and effective!,This is a great way to challenge yourself and gain skills while feeling like you're doing a puzzle or something equally engaging. As addictive as a game without the waste of time because in the end you acquired knowledge.
universalism,Great way to learn a language,"It's fun and is great for learning a language that you have some understanding of. I took 2 years of Spanish in high school and I feel like I'm understanding it better with Duolingo!! My next language will be one I have no understanding of and we'll see how it compares!!All in all, an absolute steal of an app!!!!"
stimulation,A nice change in learning a new language.,"I do believe this is a wonderful way to learn a new language b aside from living abroad. It starts you off simple then gradually starts to challenge you more and more.I've always wanted to learn another language, and working in the tourist industry r renewed that want. Meeting thousands of people every year and having the ability to speak some of the other languages is a priceless skill and ability. Though this is no completely perfect I cannot wait to brave to speak with my friends from all over the world in their own language."
self direction,Pretty Awesome App.,"In the past I had used the Rosetta Stone free trial, so when I saw this App I thought it couldn't be as high quality as Rosetta Stone, especially not for free, and especially when Rosetta Stone had such a huge price tag on it.  I put this on my phone and I was pleasantly surprised. It's simple to use and the format is very similar to Rosetta Stone.  A neat feature is the audio portion that allows you to talk back and repeat what you have heard; I'm not saying that it is 100% accurate, but it can be pretty demanding if you keep messing up certain portions.  The app is quick and fun, I just like using it when I have down time, even when I'm waiting on someone/something, I can bring this app up and practice.The only thing I would caution is that I had a year of Spanish, many, many years ago, so I am able to pick up on on non-spoken hints of the program, such as male and female, even if it is not outright saying it.  The program is not going to make you fluent in Spanish, but it does help build a bit of a vocabulary and some rudimentary phrases/terms. There is also a need to put effort in on your part to make sure that you're understanding the rules that it is hinting at as it goes through and is teaching you."
self direction,so much fun,"My sister recommended this app to practice Spanish, and I'm so glad she did!  I didn't think I'd do well, but it seems I remember much more than I thought.  And I'm learning new ways to say things, also. I love that you can go back and review any exercise as many times as you want, to keep the information fresh."
self direction,So far....so good!,I MAY be traveling to France in 2018 so I thought I would give this a shot. So far I really like it. I also like the fact that you hear audibles as well as see the phrases/sentences you are trying to learn. Nice APP!
self direction,Not as good as Duolingo online version,"I loved Duolingo on line so thought I would use this for travel when I didn't have online access.  Not as good as I hoped.  Fortunately, most places I travelled in Europe there was WiFi and I was able to use the online version."
universalism,I'm impressed!,"I am already bilingual with Spanish, but I decided to try learning Portuguese.  Although it is similar to Spanish, it's an entirely different language and understanding one doesn't guarantee understanding the other. I'm still in the process of learning it, but I'm impressed with what I've learned so far.I've found the lessons to be thorough, and they involve learning what you hear and see written.  I haven't found rules of pronunciation but I'm beginning to make some inferences based on what I see when I hear it.I've also downloaded a Portuguese Bible and am using some flashcard apps to help.  But I'm finding that this app by itself is very adequate, and I'm enjoying using it very much."
universalism,Truly works!,"I really love this application. It's the first time that I feel like I'm truly understanding Spanish. I'm still a beginner, but it's helping my confidence in understanding the language and hopefully soon, speaking it. I recommend the app to anyone who is truly wanting to learn another language."
universalism,I like Duolingo. I'm using it to re-learn French,I like Duolingo. I'm using it to re-learn French. My only criticism is that the program makes me go back and redo lessons that I already successfully finished. At this rate I'll NEVER complete the program. My skill at understanding spoken and written French is much improved.
self direction,Satisfied - An Exciting Action Series,"My wife and I love this program. It is a series of top notch action stories and sub plots most of which take place in the coal mining area of eastern Kentucky.  As a matter of fact, after watching Justified it is very difficult to find anything else that satisfies us and holds our attention. Highly recommended!"
self direction,Learning made easy and fun!,"I took 4 years of Spanish in college and its really never able to truly speak it fluently. Since that experience, I thought that I was not able to learn languages. I am now learning to speak German and I am having so much fun with it but I have not put down my tablet for the past 3 days. It is very simple but it is also exciting and very fun. I cannot say enough positive things about this app for this experience I've had. The only thing I wish was different is that they offered more languages. I have always wanted to learn to speak Russian and Polish as that is what my family can speak.  the apps that are currently out there for those two languages are quite poor please add those two languages to this app and you will get many more people downloading it!"
stimulation,Fun and a great balance of easy  challenging!,"I downloaded this after trying several other, free ""learn a foreign language"" apps.The others were so frustrating, I mentioned the problem to friends, and - thank heavens - someone recommended Duolingo.I was skeptical at first, but once I got into Duolingo's lessons, I realized they really do work. They're exactly what I needed.I'd learned French in school, many years ago. I haven't spoken French in over 10 years, and only now and then recall it when I'm watching a French film with subtitles, or watching a Poirot mystery where it helps to know what he's muttering in French.Now, with a neighbor who speaks no English and our own planned move abroad, I need to refresh my French language skills. I'm starting from a point of recognizing a few words and phrases, but I couldn't say more than ""Parlez vous..."" (""Do you speak..."") or ""Je m'appelle..."" (""My name is/I call myself..."").So, I'm starting French again, not quite from scratch... but close enough.Duolingo is perfect for me. It's fun. It's light. It's free (though there may be ads on it, according to some reviewers), and I quickly learned: Pay attention during the easy lessons, because a challenge may be ahead. You'll need to remember those words and spellings.So far, the only reason I'd pay for the Plus version is because I want to support Duolingo. I love it that they provide these great lessons in basic French, free to everyone.I'm giving this an enthusiastic five stars. It's a light, fun course that feels more like play than serious study. But it still produces great results and learning."
universalism,awesome,"My husband and I do a Spanish lesson a night, and we've found ourselves actually understanding each other! And to my surprise, I can write it now too, and can actually understand what my sister is texting me! Not all the words yet, but I'm not done with all lessons yet either."
self direction,Fantastic!!!,"Very impressed with this app. The lessons are thoughtfully grouped and the different exercises cover reading, writing/spelling, and speaking. Awesome that there is a user community and discussion to help understand intricacies. Use it all the time! =)"
universalism,Great App to Learn Language,The app is fun enough that you will use it. It's easy to test out of sections that you know. The app also has tolerance for slight misspellings. This free app compares favorably with the first Rosetta Stone unit.
universalism,After hearing John Stossel talk about this app on his ...,"After hearing John Stossel talk about this app on his weekly TV show, I decided to buy it (free) from the Amazon App Store.  It is unbelievable.  I already speak some Spanish, but this app makes it so much easier to refine my understanding of it.  When you ""forget"" to study on a day, you get an e-mail reminder to do so."
self direction,Five Stars,Easy. It has some interaction which helps a lot
universalism,just get it,"This app is a great way to build vocabulary. You do need a basic understanding of language, masculine / feminine nouns and conjugation as these concepts are not actually explained."
stimulation,Excellent Application,"Fun, accurate and enjoyable.  Four university Spanish classes 16 years ago and I and my 3 kids are challenged and encouraged."
stimulation,Yes! Yes! Yes! YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Oh my gosh I am not joking this is an epic app! It works! It truly does. I'm learning Italian on it and have not even been doing it for a week and I probably know  over 30 words. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn a new language. I find no flaws!  How it works:This game works by giving you different challenges if words. Sometimes it will say the words and you have type it back in English. Sometimes you have to choose the right English words for the phrase it is giving you. Another thing I just love is the voice that tells you the words is nice and clear. Also don't get too many wrong or you fail that lesson. You have a certain amount of hearts and if you exceed the amount of tries you fail. You can try again of course.STILL LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!
stimulation,A fun way to learn a new language,My oldest daughter challenged me to learn French using DuoLingo and so far I am having fun and learning.
self direction,Great job,I read the reviews before downloading the app and my honest thought was that people were over exaggerating how effective it was. After using it for three weeks now I can say it is awesome. I took Spanish 101 and 102 in high school and 101 in college and still did not learn and RETAIN as much as I have using this app every day. The lessons are repetitive enough to where you can keep reviewing but the different approaches of the same question keeps it from becoming tedious and predictive. Spanish is my husband's native tongue and he is impressed on how much I have learned in such short time.  Highly recommend the app.
self direction,it really helps,Is helping me instantanly with dutch/german. A language that i thought would never thiught possible to be understood by my little brain. Fro. The beginning you learn a word in their dinaymics and aldo use repetition to help into my internalization. Is a great tool ro be free.
universalism,I love Duolingo!,"Duolingo is currently offered to students of Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Irish, Russian, Turkish, Polish, Hungarian and Romanian. I have worked with Duolingo's French program on and off for several years, so I can say from experience that it just keeps getting better and better. There are a few bugs, particularly in the recorded words, phrases and sentences, but there is also the capacity to give feedback when something does not sound right, or when the program is too rigid in its interpretation of ""the"" correct answer. There is a lively discussion group  among students, and this helps to resolve misunderstandings when they arise, as well as serve as another feedback mechanism for the developers. There are passages in the students' target language to work on translating, which range from Wikipedia entries to novels, and here crowd-sourcing really comes into play, as the finished products are being prepared for upload to the web. If working with a language you have not studied previously, I find it can be helpful to have an introductory text to the language to consult, but even that is not necessary, as there are valuable supplementary materials to be found online (e.g., at the about dot com sites for each language.)I have recently been working with the German and Italian programs, and I am enjoying them as much as I do the French. These programs can definitely become addictive, but in the best way possible, as the learner sees her/himself making progress in reading, writing and speaking the language, even one which may have been studied for years. And I haven't even mentioned the fact that this fascinating program is free! And that it moves seamlessly between the computer, smart phone and Kindle Fire!  I am waiting, along with many others, for the long-promised unveiling of the Chinese program."
self direction,Learn a Language!,"The recommendation for this program was true- a robust language learning program with both visual and audio support.  I have been recommending it to everyone I know, including a Spanish teacher who thought it was fantastic!"
universalism,I expected something totally different. I speak French and ...,"I expected something totally different.  I speak French and am trying to get some of it back, as I do not use it very often.  This is only showing me things that I already know.  My mistake for not understanding that this really is for beginners."
self direction,Gives me hope for my dreams!,"I've always loved listening to foreign languages but didn't have much of a passion for Spanish, but I am amazed by German! I've always thought it was simply elegant, but I go to a private Catholic high school so German isn't offered. So I tried out all kinds of different apps and had made no progress and just about gave up hope. Then I tried Duolingo and it is so fun and easy and I feel like I'm making significant progress! My dreams of exploring the forests of Germany and the Alps of Austria can come true and maybe I could even attend a ball in Vienna! So don't give up hope! Try Duolingo!"
self direction,Great free app,"I think this app is great for people who want to begin learning any language. Of course it isn't capable of answering questions about grammar and other linguistic difference. But.can be used to get a head start if planning to take classes! It is well worth your time and I never thought learning Spanish would be this easy.P.s the kindle app (HDX) seems a little different than the iPad app, hope they take care of soon"
universalism,Easy to use,"New to the app, but have found it very easy to use and a good basis for understanding the language.  Very pleased and will continue to learn."
self direction,n.n Complete loving of it!,"I really enjoy using Duolingo.. I have it on my kindle, my phone and I even occasionally use it on my computer.. n.n I wish they would add more languages then just the ones they have but oh well.. Little by little I am able to get a better comprehension of the languages (yes I am trying to learn several of them at once) and with Duolingo it is easier then sitting in a class.. n.n I encourage them to continue working with it, and maybe possibly adding some new languages soon? o.o Just a thought.. n.n"
self direction,Fun and Easy,I don't know any Spanish and thought it would be nice to learn especially with it growing in the United States.  I work in a public service field and find it more and more necissary to learn.  This app is easy and fun- doesn't rush you through the lessons.
self direction,Achieve  a dream.,I've wanted to study German for years; but I could never afford the materials. Duolingo has made it possible for me to pursue something that I never thought I could accomplish. If learning another language is your dream this is the app for you!
tradition,Hola!,"Wish I could have learned Spanish this way in high school. The game is easy to follow and makes learning and reading Spanish easier than the tradition ways that I had to use in school. Even though the program is easy to use, previous knowledge was/is helpful when using Duolingo."
tradition,English to Spanish has lots of material and starts simply,"Based on Duolingo's rating system, I am an advanced Spanish-language learner. I got this free app hoping to brush up on my very rusty Spanish skills. For this purpose, I have been very grateful for the option to test out of each of the first three levels, and then to test out of each individual subject after that. I haven't yet reached a section test that I can't pass, but I've been studying Spanish ever since elementary school. Taking the tests provides a decent review, but I'm not sure it will help my conversational Spanish much.I certainly hope that the sections I haven't reached will cover the subjunctive as well as the future and conditional tenses. I haven't seen anything in the vosotros form either, so this may not be the best way to learn the Spanish spoken in Spain.  The vocabulary is very text-book style. There don't seem to be any words specific to a certain region or even any colloquial phrases included. I haven't seen any cultural notes, either. Those are not necessary for an introduction to the language, I suppose.It looks to me like the lessons begin very simply and build very gradually, so it would be an excellent choice for a beginner. I'm not sure yet how far it will take you into the more advanced grammar.  It probably doesn't help with conversational Spanish, but a person-to-person setting is the best for that anyway.I'm glad I've had the chance to try this out. I think I'll get a taste for French or German next!"
self direction,"Good place to start, but more please.","I've only just started using this app, but find it pretty good thus far.Seems like it teaches you the way you would learn a language organically, through trial and error correction.  I know, through past language study, that Duolingo is, through that trial and error process, teaching you how to use formal/familiar, male/female, singular/plural, and the like, constructions.  But, it's very subtle if you didn't have a clue about theses sort of things.That leads me to one of it's shortcomings, at least for me, and the reason the app is a 4 and not a 5.  Namely, it doesn't provide a whisper of explanation of these sorts of things.  It would be a great help, for me anyway, if the little message that pops up when you make an error gave an explanation.  For example, you have (no pun intended) tu, usted, vosotros, and ustedes, which all mean you.  Now in English there's just &#34;you,&#34; no (in order) singular informal/formal or plural informal/formal versions of you, though generally we figure that out through context.  So a simple, &#34;you used tu (the familiar),when you should have used usted (the formal)&#34;  would be helpful in my being able to separate the two in my head.  And, go a step further and give me an easy place to find that tells me when I should use one over the other.In the vein of more explanations, please; How about explaining (in an initial page?) what xp points are and how they are used.  Or the meter that goes around the microphone; is more better?  I tried really butchering a phrase and pretty much got the same reaction. If more is better, then I could aim for that."
stimulation,Wonderful,"Great tool to increase your language studying, recommend to anyone who wants to challenge themselve."
stimulation,A fun and simple way to learn a language!,I was going to buy Rosetta stone but my kids Spanish teacher told me to try this site and I am very glad I did.  I can use it on my computer or my kindle and it is amazing!  I find myself learning with minimal effort.  I feel challenged and find myself getting very involved.  Fun and educational can't beat that!  I stink at spelling so that is a bit challenging but the app adapts which is awesome!!  Gracias duolingo!
self direction,Awesome duolingo,"I always thought French was difficult, with Duolingo I already know the basics ANSI's so easy to learn, interactive and fun., I strongly recommend Duolingo"
self direction,Clever,"This is a handy app; don't let the kiddie mascot fool you.  No conjugating verbs.  With more or less a learn-as-you-go pace, feels like a game to pass the time.  Good interaction and feedback; uses multimedia effectively.  For a gritty person, seems to have enough levels such that he/she could conceivably become fluent."
self direction,great app for learning basics.,"This app is great for learning the basics in different languages. It requires you to go back and review old lessons. you do have to look for explinations of the grammar rules, they are not forced on you. I love that it is completely free. you can buy things in the app but it is only with credits you get by learning with in the app and the things you buy only help you learn more. this is a well thought out app."
self direction,Awesome,It is awesome and you really really should download this awesome app!! When I first heard French I thought it sounded a little like a language I would come up with so then someone said to download duolingo and when I did it was awesome!!
universalism,great  free app!,"This app is great especially for those w/ some understanding of languages, conjugating, and articles.  My 11 & 10 yr old love the app but have some problems with the ideas of articles and verb conjugations.  These ideas are not expressly covered. I love the app though.  It is really great for conversational Spanish.  You use visual, auditory, physical learning."
stimulation,Nice teaching aid,"I am enjoying the challenges on Duolingo! They assist with learning the language you choose to learn, as well as, spelling of the language. Learning both spelling and sound of the language spoken helps learning the language more easier. Enjoy!"
self direction,Super easy and fast to learn,It was so helpful earning languages is so fun and easyÃ°???I never thought I could learn German so easily at age 11 they may not have every language but hey u can still learn a lot
universalism,"Easy, fun, friendly learning","I have chosen to learn spanish. I have friends who speak it and I see the written Spanish language around me every day, so this is helpful.  The lessons are broken down into small chapters, so you can determine your own speed.  If you lose all the hearts during the lesson, it means you need to repeat it.  You can even go back to lessons you mastered in the past to refresh your comprehension.  Also, if you need help in understanding a concept, you can read the notes and comments from other students and assistants (??) regarding that specific drill.  I also like to listen to the speaker and repeat the phrases even when the app does not require me to speak.  I also like to try to understand thephrases before peeking at the hints.  A nice interactive app which I downloaded for free which is very valuable.  I don't know if it eventually want me to pay to go farther in the future, but I will see how far I can go. I recommend this to beginners, those who want to get some basics on these languages offered, and old students who need a refresher.  Eventually, I will also check out the German lessons to see how much I have retained from high school 30 years ago."
stimulation,Pretty good app.  Worth having to start learning another language.,"Neat program, and if you have the time, can learn for hours.  It challenges you in various ways, which is good reinforcement.  Worth having, but wish it did not pester to play it each day."
self direction,Move over Rosetta stone!!,This is the best foreign language app available!  Very interactive and educational while remaining entertaining.  I like the fact that it was created to translate all languages on line for free while offering education to users simultaneously. Created by the same guy that created Wikipedia after he got bored with retirement. I'm glad he thought of doing this because this app is the best!! Way more productive than crushing candy or browsing social media sites.
stimulation,Not bad.  pretty fun.,Great app. I think you still need to know a couple words already to get thru the app more easily. But of you don't know any words to start it will just be more of a challenge but still fun.
power,By far the best language app I've ever used,"I've been using Duolingo to improve my French.Over the years I've used a variety of language apps, podcasts, websites, books, and other resources to learn, or try to learn, a new language. Usually French or Cantonese. Duolingo is comprehensive in that it incorporates speaking, listening, and writing a language. My French had improved drastically just in the short time I've been using the app.The app addresses things that may seem minor, such as, allowing you to easily change your keyboard setting from English to French and back, and using the microphone to provide feedback on whether you are pronouncing things correctly. While I've found the microphone isn't always accurate, it's pretty good and definitely better than just speaking to an empty room with no feedback at all.I was disappointed that the app has so few languages available but I suspect this is what has allowed them to do so well with what they do offer. It also lacks instruction for people brand new to a language. While I had the benefit of having had some past instruction in the language, other people might find understanding the difference in sentence structures and how gender influences words, etc.Overall though I am very happy with it!"
self direction,Shoring up flagging skills,"Around 15 years ago, I took French and Italian for a year or so - just enough to get some basics down. Lack of use will erode any skill and Duolingo has helped me regain lost ground. I can't speak to the app's effectiveness for learning a new language but I've been very pleased with it as a practice tool and for expanding my vocabulary.On the development end, I am blown away. Changes seem to be well thought out and the app gets better with every update."
self direction,Great App!,I love this app! I took two semesters of German a decade ago and so far I am remembering some of it. Nice to bring it back! Thanks for creating this app!
self direction,Amazingly effective,Amazing effective my daughter actually wanted to learn. This app is a game changer. What I thought was cool was the variety of languages you could learn. The only negative thing is you have to have WiFi to use this app. But I was so impressed with this app I give it five stars.
stimulation,Really fun and Effective,Easy to learn and helpful. Plus free! I use it as a mental exercise to keep my mind sharp. Learning a new language is a great way to stimulate brain and challenge yourself. App lets you know and sends you reminders to keep practising. It also gives you option to personalise your goals so you could realistic achievements for yourself. Definitely worth a try.
self direction,Great. app,I'm multilingual and have been using this app to stay sharp. It's well thought out. I don't know how it well it works from a beginner's standpoint since I've studied all the languages offered.
self direction,i tried mango,I tried mango and I thought it was the best language learner but then my teacher told me about duolingo  and how I could earn extra credit and I still didn't try it and later on I try it and it's it's the most effective spanish app I recommend this for anyone learning spanish it really drills the spanish in your head
self direction,"Outstanding tool... and fun, too!","This app gives you a great way to practice or review vocabulary and grammar in a variety of modes. I've been using it to review German, which I studied in college and haven't thought about in many years  and to try to learn Italian. For the latter, it's helpful to check out the Duolingo website and other reference materials to give you the grammar rules that you will practice. I guess this makes it sound dull, but I find myself firing it up at the end of a long day to unwind, just as others would with the more mindless games out there. This app is much better than the Duolingo app for the iPhone and is highly recommended over that.My only issue is that, very infrequently, the app hangs when it moves from one question to the next... but that is pretty minor.Well done!"
stimulation,Makes Learning Fun,"This is a great program, enough repetition to reinforce lessons but always adding a challenge.  Highly effective in increasing vocabulary."
self direction,"Great Beginners App, but Better Maintenance App","You've heard the saying, 'If you don't use it,  you lose it.' This is true for innumerable things, but never more so than in languages. This app helps me maintain my language proficiency, and if you know the process for language learning can jumpstart additional languages. I would recommend caution to those who have no experience whatsoever in languages though. Depending on the person's independent learning level this might not be the best introduction to languages.I would like to see more languages, including some that are more academic in nature; Classical Latin, Attic/ Classical Greek, Classical Hebrew or even modern Hebrew, and maybe some Arabic and/or Farsi."
universalism,fun and accessible way to learn a language,"My husband is French and speaks French  to our kids at home, so I am exposed to a lot of verbal French. Duolingo uses sight, sound and writing drills to give you a solid understanding of vocab, spelling and pronunciation. I feel like I might actually learn a certain level of French and be able to speak with my in-laws one day - for better or worse :)"
stimulation,Expand Your Horizons!,"Friends, who travel worldwide often, recommended Duolingo as a great communication preparation tool. I like being able to use this on my computer, phone, and tablet. For several years, I've wanted to learn a foreign language. Duolingo is helping me learn Spanish and sends reminders that I need to do daily lessons/practices. It teaches the basics and builds so that you move on from simple words to phrases and sentences. The forms you use are to listen/read and identify by speaking, typing, translating from Spanish to English and vice-versa. If there was a way to give it 4 and 1/2 stars, I would have. I didn't give it a 5 because punctuation and accents can't be used  a basic keyboard, so that's a challenge because it shows you are not correct when they're missing in what you type. At least it is not harsh about the errors. You can go back to review previous lessons, which is helpful if you've had  to skip a day or two."
self direction,A great platform to start a new language,"Choosing the right program for you is difficult enough, couple that with large sums of monetary investment and you got your self a high pressure situation.Duolingo is a program that recognizes your dilemma, and provides you a solution that does not sacrifice on quality. It offers a language learning program that competes with other for pay programs, and the best part is that it is free!Do not assume that because it is free it is lacking in quality. On the contrary, it is free because you will provide valuable work that will act as payment for allowing you access to this program. Your use of this program will help translate text of other languages. Not only are you learning a new language and expanding your world view, but you are also providing an invaluable service for the betterment of human culture.This is an application that needs to be in all devices.Give it a try, I'm sure you'll like it."
self direction,excellent teaching tool,I'm so glad I d/l this app. it's the easiest way to learn a language! I love it! I'm encouraged enough to give it serious thought. Duolingo has made this app fun and challenging at the same time.  Thank you very much.
tradition,Wow ! Great program!,"Love, love this app! My Spanish speaking skills are limited to say the least. (Been a long time since high school. And no, you can't ask how many years!) So when my son told me about Duolingo, I was skeptical. But it is great! I am beginning to understand not only words, but grammar as well. (Although I am still struggling with plurals and pronouns!)Duolingo uses auditory, visual, and traditional methods of learning a language. There is some memorization but the lessons are integrated with hearing the words/sentences spoken, and pictures. You build on one lesson to the next. and if you fail to grasp the concepts, then OOPS! you have to start over. While my Spanish instructor friends may frown upon this ""shortcut"" method, it is providing me with the rudimentary skills to perhaps pursue a higher level of learning EspaÃƒÂ±ola. I like that it is available for my phone, Kindle Fire or PC, so there's no excuse for not doing today's lesson. Now if I can just get those durn plurals and pronouns correct. Adios, mi amigos/amigas!"
self direction,Great for basics - keeps you motivated,"This is my 11th language to start from 0 (unless I count the years of Latin). The structure makes a lot of sense and the pattern repetition keeps the salient grammar points fresh. Clearly a lot of thought went into continuous use and how cognition and mnemonics work. Highly recommend it. Wish there were a Chinese and Japanese module, hard to keep those fresh without practice"
self direction,Amazing app,"I have such a low attention span for learning anything new that I never thought I'd get around to brushing up on my Italian or German. This app is great because it genuinely is very fun and rewarding, and you feel great about the progress you make. I've gone over some of my old lessons just to go for a perfect score :) . Would definitely recommend and I really hope they add Russian in future :)"
self direction,Beginner,"I like using it. I started using it on my iPhone and I thought my kindle screen would be better. They don't offer the same languages on each device so I just started over with Ukranian instead of Russian. I wish things were pronounced more but I just started so perhaps that will change. It's fun to use, I try to do the lessons more than once even if I ace it. I do not have the courage to say anything to anyone at this point but again, I'm just starting out. It's holding my interest and it's not dry like reading a workbook,or text book...and it's FREE can't beat it."
stimulation,great free app,This app has been very helpful in my adventure to learn a new language - Spanish. It is a fun and user-friendly way to learn the basics. It teaches reading and oral comprehension as well as evaluating your spoken word. I really enjoy this!
self direction,A Wonderful Surprise,"Stumbled upon this when looking for ways to learn a language online. Learning is set up like a game and you are rewarded for successful answers. This isn't the best method for everyone but I find that it is perfect for me. Much better than Rosetta Stone, the community here is friendly and answers questions and creates thought provoking discussions. You actually are learning the language, not just memorizing flashcards."
self direction,Dont Struggle - Learn,"Superior FREE app that really does help you learn a new language. Its really an app that is worth its weight in gold.The lessons are well thought out and you progress at a satisfying rate. It is never overbearing nor confusing. Its engaging and redundant in the right way. Retention is there!!!! I'm learning German, think Italian is around the corner. It makes even the hard languages fun to learn.This is for many other native speaking languages to learn English or some can learn French or other!What are you waiting for?  ""Du schaffst das"" or Sue Schaffen das ...German for you can do it"
tradition,excellent app!,I love this app and recommend it to people I know almost daily. I feel that making an effort to learn a foreign language is respectful to the multicultural world we live in.  Duolingo makes it 100 times easier not only to begin learning a new language but also to practice second languages you may already know. The fact that it is accessible to nearly everyone with a tablet or smartphone makes this by far the best app I've ever downloaded.
tradition,Best language learning app ever!  And not because it is free.,This works for me where more traditional methods don't.  Get this if you really want to learn a new language.
tradition,Fast and fun,"Duolingo is a great way to begin learning a new language. The native speaker is helpful with pronunciation, but I miss the grammar lesson of traditional language education. That said, the rapid pace is encouraging and the reviews help reenforce the lessons."
universalism,must have,Absolutely love this app. I haven't studied Spanish in almost a decade and this app has me understanding more of the conversations going on around me enough that while I may not respond in Spanish yet I expect to be able to soon.
self direction,frequent user of duolingo,"I am a frequent user of duolingo and would recommend it to anyone. I have been taking Spanish for seven years now and school and am studying abroad this semester in Spain. I wanted to use this app to brush up on my Spanish but it has done so much more than that. It feels to me like I am taking an online course in Spaexnish. It is extraordinarily in-depth with its explanations and provides different tips and advice for remembering rules and vocab. Whenever you get a question wrong you can go into discussion forums where people have posted questions about the answer and I have always found in-depth explanations from other users on why the answer is the way it is. I have found few mistakes on Duolingo and I know they are constantly working to make it better. They are gaining new languages all the time and I will always use Duolingo to practice and keep up with my Spanish, even when I am in Spain this semester. Thank you so much, Duolingo!This app also is easy and works well, thought I was confused at first how to do accents. It is actually easier than on the web though! You simply hold down a letter and then swipe up to choose your different options. Ã‚Â¡Perfecto!"
tradition,Easy & Fun,"I am using this app to learn Spanish, French, and German.  It has been very effective for learning both grammar and words.  The app makes learning a language more enjoyable than learning the traditional way.  If you use this app you will pick up speaking your chosen language in no time at all.  Highly recommend."
self direction,Very helpful!,"I use this every time we are planning a trip, even to places I know. It helps me fine new restaurants and attractions. My GPS is good once we are on the road but this is great when I am in the planning stages."
universalism,love this app!,"I have taken a few years of Spanish courses in high school and college, but I think this app has helped me more than any of them. The different methods for teaching the language (reading, listening, translating, dictating, etc), is what makes it so beneficial. I have always had a difficult time understanding spoken Spanish and this app is helping me overcome that problem."
self direction,This is for real.,Duo lingo is one of the most amazing language apps I have EVER tried! if you are even remotely considering this app GET IT. it took me minutes to learn a lot of words and phrases. Not tricking you I promise. This FREE thing helps me learn a language I never thought I could learn. Even if you screw up a little you still can figure out what you missed relatively easily. At a push of a few buttons you can try a new language. DO IT. P.S. I am a real person typing this
stimulation,Great learning tool!!!,I love this app!!!! What a great challenge and it makes it more of a game than actually learning  very clever tool for learning a new language!!!!!
self direction,wonderful languages,"I love Duolingo because when I wanted to learn French as a child, I thought it impossible. But now, I can freely explore duolingo and the French language, as well as many more languages. Thanks Duolingo! Or, Merci Duolingo!"
self direction,Bite-sized daily lessons mix variety and repetition,"I studied French in high school and college years ago, and I've picked up a bit of Spanish here and there, and by reading some of the Bible in Spanish. I decided to pick up some German with Duolingo because I have a nephew who studied that. Well, that started out so well I decided to brush up my French and see what I could do with Spanish. Probably not a good idea to work on three languages at once, but I'm enjoying it and making progress. I was so rusty on French my attempt to test out of the Basics failed (just barely), but it's nice to know the option is there if you don't want to review from the beginning. Repetition is an important part of learning any language, but it can get boring. This program solves the problem by mixing up the styles of questions. It starts out very easy - some of the questions are as easy as tapping the picture of the word given in your native language with the target language below it. On some questions, you can tap the given word and see its translation, so you don't have to guess even if it is a new word (but guessing can be fun and doesn't ""hurt"" much!). Pay attention to the little words that go with them, though! In English (which is hard to learn in other ways) we just have ""the"" for everything, but in French and Spanish you have variations to match the gender and number of the objects (German has three singular forms, one being neuter, I guess). How do you know if an object takes a masculine (le or el) or feminine (la)? Practice, practice, practice! Take your time and think and memorize, and write words and combinations down. And Duolingo does let you go back and review skill sets. The instant feedback is much more enjoyable than doing written homework, but the German is making me want to get a textbook and do some extra studying! Some questions let you translate phrases or sentences by selecting from a choice of words, others let you listen to spoken words, phrases, or sentences and then select the words you hear. More challenging questions require you to type in the translation or words from memory. It even has voice recognition so some questions require you to repeat things in the target language. If it doesn't recognize what you say, it doesn't count it against you (lots of things can go wrong with voice recognition, such as background noises). If you can't get away from the noise or otherwise can't or don't want to use your microphone, you can turn off that feature and it will only give you the other kinds of questions. I've noticed that it also gives some leeway for typographical errors, although sometimes it's still counted typos as wrong and other times I've just been wrong but it was counted as a typo. It generally gets it right and the two kinds of errors balance out. I've typed in a translation when the task was to type out what was spoken in the foreign language, and it gave me a do-over. But watch out, if you make a mistake in your own language, it will count that wrong, too! English speakers had better know how to properly use ""to,"" ""too,"" and ""two,"" for example. Or maybe using DuoLingo will help you with that, too! Daily e-mail reminders (which can be turned off) help you to stick to it.[ADDED LATER] Well, I'm up to Level 5 in all three languages, and I'm definitely feeling the pinch of trying to make it QuadLingo. As I fail lessons, though, previous skills re-open to show where I need to go back and practice more, which is a good thing. It's exciting to be learning these languages, and I'm thinking I might dig through my collection of language texts to add to and aid my DuoLingo studies, since I've gone and set myself a three-pronged challenge. I wish I'd thought of taking notes earlier (I just added that bit with this edit); I'm sure that would be enough to make studying one language a cinch with DuoLingo."
tradition,Easy and fun,"I have studied four languages in traditional class settings, and for practical use this app is much better."
stimulation,Fun and captivating way to learn Spanish,"Not sure what would happen if this was the only tool I was using, but combines very well with my live classes.  Progression is logical and steady, but with enough challenge to prevent boredom.  Highly recommended, especially for the price.  One of the few free apps that is consistently excellent."
self direction,An excellent way to learn a new language or review,"I have used this app on my Kindle Fire to learn French, and review Spanish and German.  I also use the Duo website which has more features.  The app works very well.  I suggest that the user change the language setting on any handheld device to receive an even greater benefit in the learning experience.  For example, when I study Spanish, I change the language setting for the Kindle to Spanish.  It gives the correct keyboard, and it gives the correct spelling complete with the accent mark in the proper place.  It also gives a list of words directly below the input box, at least the Kindle Fire does this.  While the purist may consider this to be a cheat, I prefer to think that it enhances the learning experience.While there is very limited opportunity for in-depth listening comprehension with this app, there are plenty of free podcasts available in all of the languages that are contained within the app.  Also, it is helpful to have a good dictionary, either hard copy or digital.The Duolongo app has helped me learn basic French faster than I thought possible.  It seems like it would help beginners and intermediate level learners of any age, but would also be a great review for the more advanced learner."
self direction,Great App- Free sans ads!  Sans- French for without!,"I had four years of college French- about 30 years ago, so I thought I would work my mind a bit and take a refresher.  This is a great tool as it is slowly coming back to me.  I am so thrilled that I am going to start Spanish next.  I highly recommend this for anyone needing a good language app."
stimulation,Great App For Different Languages,This is the best app for learning new languages. It very challenging but helps you learn the meanings and gives you helpful hints. You can challenge your friends and even try to get the height score you can. Overall this app is a great use of energy and time. Download Doulingo. It will make you happy like it made me :)
power,Good for finally starting on that on language,"I really love  this program. It lets me gradually work on different languages at a controlled pace. The selection has greatly expanded since the beginning, an  I suspect it will continue to do so.It should b  noted that this won't grant proficiency unto itself; it still takes effort to learn, and time spent reviewing, but Duolingo is great tool to make the process enjoyable."
stimulation,Really learning Italian,"I LOVE duolingo!  I am over 50 and it's more difficult to memorize things. But I am actually learning easily.  It's fun to be challenged in several ways. It quizzes you on reading, writing, and speaking."
self direction,Great app!!,My two children and I are all using this app right now as an extracurricular activity for homeschool. We love it!!  I actually retained more from high school then I thought I had!
self direction,Amazing,Duolingo is a great way to learn new languages.It is really easy to learn languages.I thought learning a new language would be a lot harder and Duolingo made it easy.Plus it is free.I absolutely recommend it.
stimulation,Must have if you truly want to learn a new language!,"This app puts learning languages in an entirely new perspective. When I was in high school learning French I hated it, but duolingo has made it fun and exciting. It brings out my competitive side. Trying to make it through an entire round of questioning without losing any hearts really challenges you in to thinking hard about how you answer. I have already recommended it to several friends."
self direction,Very good but you should know this,"Duolingo is very good refresher. True beginners should consider taking an instructor led course to better understand the use of the words (male/female uses of verbs, congugation, etc). Instructor led courses provide an enriched social  interaction with other students and timely corrections and explanations from the instructor."
self direction,good but not for intensive time constructed learners,I am learning French through school and thinking I could do with some extra practice. I hope to be passable at French in a few months and even thought it it's very structured and very accurate it is not intensive enough to become completely fluent.
self direction,Es ist okay,"I have been using this app for a few months now, and at first glance, I thought it was fantastic, but I think that was because I was fervidly learning the German language because of my strong desire to do so, it is also because prior to starting Duolingo, I developed a partial understanding of the language through a variety of sources, to be honest, I don't think Duolingo is a good way to learn a language.One of the reasons being is that it was easy to understand as far as my previously developed understanding of the language, but when I was trying to learn new things in the language, it was difficult for me to learn regardless of my desire to learn the language, because Duolingo doesn't do much to teach you new things, all it does is tell you the definition of unknown words, and you have to rely on yourself to remember them.Another thing is that Duolingo doesn't teach the grammar of the language at all, and I know this because I understand that there are certain grammar rules in German that are different in English, I don't know exactly what those rules are, but I know they exist, and when I translate a sentence from English to German where the grammar rules apply, it is usually an incorrect translation, and I have no idea how to learn from my mistakes in this app, the only help you can get on this app is comments from other users of the app, which is only helpful sometimes.I think the only things this app can be used for is to get background information on subsequent education of the language, or to practice what you already know in the language. If your goal is to learn a language, this app shouldn't be used as your main source."
self direction,have to know how to spell,"nedee an app for my ds and i to learn spanish. This is a great app--lots of repetition, but in a variety of ways so you don't get bored. Also has a part where you speak the words so it can check your pronunciation. So far, so good. Only problem is that, one part asks you to translate a spoken word or phrase and you have to type it out. Sure hope you remembered how to SPELL that spanish word you just learned, otherwise, you get it wrong. This means, my ds can't be far from me when using this app because he has to constantly ask me how to spell things. Just be advised that the user would probably need to be third grade or older to use this independently. Otherwise, we like it."
self direction,Best language app,"I have purchased a number of language software programs,  but this is the first one I have a really taken the time to use. Just wasn't motivated to be tied to the computer while learning or reviewing a language. This app is what I have needed all along. The ability to hear vocabulary words before choosing a final answer is great, though the pictures practically guide you to the correct answer.The lessons are short enough to fit into a tight schedule and at the same time, challenge you to remember previous lessons. I do like that the program reminds me about including accents and tildes, but I'm not sure how to add them. The good thing is the program doesn't take away points for not using accents and tildes. The bad part is I'm not sure I will remember which words require them."
stimulation,just fun,for some reason this app really is enjoyable. it has just the right amount of challenge to feel as if progress is being made coupled with a useful amount of review.
universalism,Better than my paid subscription to a language site,"Really does help you learn a language with practice. It quizzes you to verify your understanding. It mostly asks you to select an answer without actually teaching you first -- so you guess a lot in the beginning. But that is not a bad thing. The process is engaging and ultimately inspires you to teach yourself without a physical teacher present. There are User Discussions associated with lessons, but I found myself doing additional Internet searches on certain words and phrases. The extra research significantly enhanced my understanding and helped me remember better.Also, there's a lot of fun to be had here. It offers multiple ways to learn (listening, speaking, writing and translating) which all serve to help you remember your new language. Plus, there is the ""gaming"" element that allows you to achieve points called ""lingots"" that can be traded for special learning modules. I gave this app 4 stars instead of 5 because it sometimes gave me ""credit"" for speaking the correct words when I had actually flubbed up the language. But for the most part, it was spot on!I actually have a paid subscription to a language learning site, but I find myself returning most often to this app."
self direction,Good fun for free!,"I am attempting to learn Spanish.  I am 67 years old, so this may take a while.  I thought Duolingo would an easy way to learn another language, until they threw in some Spanish grammar. It is not just conversational Spanish, but real life language.  Even if there is a  disagree with translations, a drop down box allows a message can be sent to disagree with the translation.  Just the other day, my translation to a sentence was added as another way to translate the statement."
self direction,Love the Interaction,"I'm learning German for an upcoming trip. I've tried several methods: Duolingo, books, audio books, CDs, and websites. I have acquired significantly more vocabulary and comprehension through Duolingo than any of the other methods. The interaction truly helps to solidify the learning. I also love that it is not static - it wants you to go back and review weak words periodically."
self direction,Brushing up on my language skills,"I down loaded this app to brush up on my foreign language skills starting with French. I had 8 years of French, about 60 years ago. So I thought to skip the basics and start of with the phrases. However, I could not understand the teacher's French accent. Maybe because I learned French in Holland, even though I spent every summer for six years in southern Belgium and one summer in Paris. To make a long story short, I had to start with the basics to get used to the teacher's voice and accent. Now about the app. I am happy I downloaded it, and working rapidly through the lessons. It is a great program, but I am not sure if the microphone on my Kindle Fire HDX is working or not, when it asks for pronunciation of the phrases. I'll have to figure that out later. I will add to my review later on some more, after I finish all the lessons. I plan to brush up on German next, and will check out what other languages I can learn."
stimulation,Very user friendly fun way to learn a language,"I found this app in my search for a format to learn Portuguese when my daughter was serving a mission in Brazil.  It has been enjoyable to learn.  Hearing the pronunciation of words  and trying to translate is a challenge that helps me stay determined to progress.  It is helpful to know that there  are different  dialects in Brazil, and  having a resource (daughter) who is fluent in the  language is a bonus.  The most challenging part for me is speaking, since my tongue muscles are primed to English.  I have friends in Brazil who are fluent in English and I  Skype with them to practice.  I love this app!"
self direction,GET IT NOW !! :),Are you interested in learning a new language ? THEN GET THIS APP!! I've been during to learn one of my cultures which is Spanish . I also have been looking for apps that taught me but none of them worked ... then I checked out this app .I thought it wouldn't work because I didn't look it . So I tried it out and BOOM I loved it . If you are looking to learn a new language ... I would recommend this app !!!! :)
stimulation,Love it.,"I love Duolingo. I'm doing four languages at once which is ridiculous but I am still retaining the info and learning more. There are so many ways to challenge yourself. You can chat with others and repeat lessons (which it prompts you to do). Even after you've completed a lesson the bars that show completion will go gray and you can go back and redo them. Also, once you have completed a lesson when you go back to practice more new words will come up that weren't on the first lesson. I think after you complete the entire course you should get some recognition and a transition into something more but it does nothing. That was disappointing. Still, I rate it highly and they are constantly making improvements and adding new things to make it even more fun."
universalism,I recommend with a but,I gave it a 4 because I would like more explanation to my error....errors. But I do love the app. I find myself understanding a lot more when I hear it.
stimulation,I figured it would be nice to learn some basic Spanish,"I got this app to give me something constructive to do while I recover from surgery. I figured it would be nice to learn some basic Spanish. I may not be able to say anything particularly useful yet (I've only had the app a few days), but I am having fun. Duolingo doesn't follow the conventional method of teaching He, She, We, They and verb forms. It jumps right in, and you are expected to pick up on the different forms as you go. You may be asked at the start of a lesson to translate something you have never seen before, which some people may find irritating. I find it a fun challenge to try to infer the meaning from the context. I do admit to asking my two teenagers (who are taking Spanish I)  for clarification on a few things, but for the most part it isn't difficult."
universalism,fun way to learn,"I took Spanish in high school long ago. This game like format is fun and allows repeat practices easily, and good tests to help you evaluate your understanding. Come on!  What do you have to loose?FAST, FUN, FREE!!!"
self direction,seems promising,"I took quite a bit of Spanish in high school, but have forgotten most. I thought this was worth a try to refresh. I've not gotten very far, but it seems to have definite potential.  I like the variety of activities - I believe it enhances the learning experience and makes the lesson more memorable."
self direction,Really well thought out,This is app is awesome and super easy to use! The organizational system as well as the reward system were really well thought out. I just wish I could ask questions about specific words or ways to use words.
stimulation,Language Made Fun,"This is a fun, interactive way to learn a language and challenge yourself at the same time.  The owl and his rewards are addicting."
self direction,I finally learned Spanish!,"I love this app. I have wanted to learn Spanish for 30 years now. I took in in both High School and College, but never really learned to speak it. I have tried a couple of other programs over the years, but for whatever reason, I just didn't stick to it . With Duolingo, learning is fun and doesn't seem so tedius, or overwhelming as I have felt with past efforts. I have stuck with Duolingo for a year now, and I can converse fairly well when we vacation in Mexico and with Spanish speakers here in the States.  I do two learning sessions per day, each one taking me less than 10 minutes. So, if you commit to just a few minutes a day, eventually you will be able to speak a new language. I plan on trying French next. I never would have thought  that I would some day speak three languages, but it is now within my reach."
self direction,Learning German the easy way.,"The entire family, 5 years thru 43 years, love and use almost daily this well thought out app. Very easy, builds gradually. And fun."
self direction,... completed the sessions but the first five were very good. It's essentially repetitive learning with the ability to ...,"I haven't completed the sessions but the first five were very good. It's essentially repetitive learning with the ability to go back and refresh as often as you need to. Some things aren't explained but if you pay attention you can intuit what you need to know. That's actually not a bad thing. The app speaks phrases for you to interpret and it does it at the speed a native speaker would use. This is very useful to me because I've been in non English speaking countries and thought I was prepared only to discover that I was only prepared if spoken to very slowly. Finally it also checks your own pronunciation periodically, another feature I really like."
universalism,I love this.,this has totally helped me with my French class I'm understanding the words and they make it solo cute.I am totally recommending this to my friends Awesome App.
tradition,After only a few days i already feel more confident,"In my job I come into contact with people from all over the world. I have been using DuoLingo for a few days and already my conjugation of common Spanish verbs has improved. The app certainly takes a non traditional path to teaching you a language but for me it seems to be working. Certainly worth a look - I know many of you will have learning a new language on your list of new years resolutions. Don't let this year pass you by! Download this app now and if you work hard, you may not sustain fluency but you should be able to get by."
self direction,Not So Bad,I downloaded the app to keep up with my Spanish over the summer and it's really well developed and thought out. I never took Spanish I or Introductory Spanish so this is filling in the blanks I had been missing in Spanish II and III. I'm extremely grateful that this app doesn't needlessly repeat or baby its users. I don't feel stupid or irritated while learning at my own pace.
self direction,Great for reviewing and adding words you don't know to your vocabulary!,I'm in Spanish 2 at my school and thought it would be good for practice. I was surprised at how many basic words my teacher withheld from teaching me. I learned these words fairly quickly and found that I like this program better than the online program our school uses!
tradition,never knew learning a new language could be so easy,I love love love this app it gives me a chance to work on a different language as well as my traditional classes. It offers a large variety of languages and is easy to understand. My only complaint is that when gender matters you have no idea what gender it's supposed to be because it never tells you first.
universalism,Spanish,Very good went to understanding lil to knowing more.I find this is more Latin American not castillian. some similar but very helpful
universalism,Five Stars,Getting much better understanding to speak read and write the language.. Excellent app.
tradition,Not what I expected.,"I've tried to learn different languages in the past, both by taking traditional classes and on my own with the aid of books and tapes.  This app was vastly more effective than either of those approaches, and a lot more fun as well.  Plus, the price can't be beat!My only misgiving was that it was all practice, no theory.  I would have liked to know *why* a particular verb form or case was the right one, so that I could draw connections on my own."
stimulation,so helpful in many ways,I take French and I could learn anything so someone suggested this app to me ÃƒÂ°Ã‚?Ã‚?Ã‚? and I use this app so much it's so much fun but I wish you could challenge my friends ÃƒÂ°Ã‚?Ã‚?'
self direction,spanish for the hopeless,"I may actually retain some of this !!!!!  best app I have.  gracias, duolingo for creating repetitive, fun ways to get Spanish in my head"
tradition,Fun way to learn a new language!,"I have started learning Spanish using this app, which will be very useful in my nursing profession. I like how each new lesson builds on vocabulary and grammar from previous lessons, as a traditional classroom course would. I also started the French lessons, and although I took five years in high school, it has been a great refresher!Highly recommend for someone not looking for another mindless game!"
universalism,"Hola, yo ritac","Actually, I find that I am enjoying using this app. Used it four or five times and now I can say ""Hola"" like a native. The repetitive nature of the app and what is said ensures that you'll finally get the lessons and is a real foundation builder. This app may be the easiest way to learn Spanish."
self direction,Amazing,An awesome app. I truly appreciate the hard work that went into creating this app. You will not be disappointed.
self direction,Truly so so  No big deal,"They only teach you a small fraction if the words other lessons offer, and in the segments where it says something and you have to type what us said...it's muddled and impossible to understand"
self direction,Wow !,This is such an easy and thorough product to use!  I've learned more Spanish in 2 days than I thought I could in a month!
universalism,very good,"This app is great, especially since it was recently updated. The updates added a considerable number of languages, I wish there were more, but as it is, it's much more helpful than any other language course I have seen, if you use this app, and general internet, and or book research, I think you could do very well. If you speak english there are now 13 languages you can learn, they have courses for speakers of other languages, but I am not sure what they are.  The languages for English speakers are: (I believe from espania) Spanish, ( I belive Brazilian) Portuguese, Norwegian, Turkish, Danish, Swedish, Ukrainian, (Doitch) German, Dutch (from the Netherlands), Italian, French, Irish (commonly refured to by outsiders as Gaelic, the Celtic Language or old Irish (it is the second official language of Ireland, currently.)) And Esperanto (which is a constructed language for the purpose of globally understanding one another. It was designed to be easy to learn and is used in politics as well as being the official language of several places and the official second language in many places on earth.) This app is easy to use, has a nice interface, and, for me and many of my acquaintances, is very good for learning.  I would definitely recommend this."
universalism,better than hs spanish,I've picked up a better understanding of spanish in a few weeks playing with duolingo than in 2 years of high school Spanish.
self direction,What a brilliant idea!,"I'm actually learning Italian!  I love these lessons, and I love the interaction and the feedback.  What a brilliant idea!"
self direction,I love this app,I'm a new user and I'm using this app for only two days but it's really really cool. There's an awesome method which you'll learn grammar via examples and &#34;in-action&#34; without reading those boring grammar books and it's practices and some scores you give while studying make you remember everything it learns you. It's free and really ad free why don't you try it?
self direction,Like tricking kids to eat veggies!,I came upon this app accidentally. Grandchildren were curious about the Spanish language and wanted to be able to communicate with some visitors. This app is great for inquisitive minds. They can pace themselves and enjoy the interaction of the app. They love it and are learning while playing. I'm thrilled! They didn't know its good for them.
universalism,FREE. EFFECTIVE. INTERACTIVE. FRESH.,"first of all its free. forever. it is effective but you have to hold yourself accountable to praftice and read the discussion forums for the answers in each exercise. also say the words out loud as you practice. helps cover translafion, speaking,  and understanding with a variety of exercises. It has a cool layout and the design is easy on the eyes."
self direction,Nearly half done with the program *****,"Thought It'd try it out and maybe entertain the dream of learning another language. I am well on my way. I can now read in my new language and make simple conversation. I try never to miss a day.This app works. I'm going all the way to the end. Vielen Danke, Duo Lingo! Ich sprechen Deutsche sehr gut!"
self direction,only 1 change needed.,The only thing missing is voice interaction.
self direction,amazing way to learn!!,I am blown away by how much spanish I know in just a few days!  I never thought I would learn to conjugate verbs and the different tenses ect. It's really so easy to learn this way.
self direction,ok but lacking any theory,"I am visiting Italy this fall and thought I would try and learn a lttle  bit of the lanuage. The aps good for a free app. It loaded and works well on an original Kindle Fire. The lessons are basic with,  but no theory about usage is given until you make an error. Then you need to remember the error vs being taught the correct use from the beginning. Otherwise a good basic free introduction to a language. Also it sends yours a daily reminder to keep you interested."
self direction,Leaving out words,"Just downloaded this app.  Thought I would try the Irish learning section, the basics.  Was taught the words for man, woman, boy and girl.  Then I was asked to translate a four word sentence of which the only word I knew was man. The sentence was I am a man.  ????  Of course I was incorrect because I had not learned the words I, am and a.  Would not basic include these words?  Asking to translate what has not been taught?"
self direction,language revolution,"I have been using duolingo for almost a year now and I have seen amazing results! I have spent most of my time learning Irish. I traveled to Ireland this past summer and thanks to duolingo I was able to keep up a conversation with the native speakers and understand all of the signs without needing the English translation. It has also opened my mind to the world. I never thought I'd have an interest in Swedish, Turkish, or many other languages. I feel like I have received more than a free language education, I feel like it has broken barriers and brought the world to me."
power,"Intuitive, Easy to Use, Great Between Devices","This app is fantastic! I've been using it for weeks now to learn Spanish. The controls are intuitive and I find it easy to learn a second language. I use this app on my laptop, my Kindle Fire, and my Android phone, and the app is great for that. It always keeps up on my progress, and I've had no issues at all. It's a great way to learn another language, and the best part is that it's 100% free. However, the one tiny issue that I have with this app is that you need to have speakers. This is fine when you're working on it at home, but in public places; not so much. It plays a word/phrase in whatever language you're learning, and you are supposed to type that word/phrase out. It's a bit awkward when one is in a quiet place (think waiting room at the doctor's office). You have to turn the volume way down and hold it up to your ear, or just wear headphones. This isn't a major issue, and all in all, I think that Duolingo is a fantastic app for people of all ages to learn an important life skill of being bilingual."
self direction,I am learning Swedish and it's fun,"At first, I thought this was not going to work. It felt a bit obvious. I mean, the pictures answered the questions so what was I learning exactly? But perhaps because it was so easy, I stuck it out and have actually come to understand a lot of Swedish. I am watching ScandiNoir tv-series and recognizing words and sentence structure. Of course, I am nowhere close to not needing subtitles, but I have the basics in a very short amount of time.  Of course, it helps that I have learned two other languages already, so my mind knows how to think about structure, etc. but still, this is painless."
self direction,Really fun way to learn a new language,I am really enjoying exploring a new language with Duolingo. The game format and audio/ visual reinforcementvare very effectve. I highly recommend it.
stimulation,Excellent way to learn a different language!,It challenges you mentally also.  It's a great way to learn a new language.  I love  this app!  Thank you Duolingo!
self direction,Marvelous,"My favourite application, it does wonders in learning languages. I've always wanted to learn German, and this is the best tool out their. I've also picked up some Norwegian, never thought I would, but it's s so addictive, in a good way."
stimulation,What A Way to Learn!,I love this app. It uses various forms of reinforcement. I also appreciate the motivational emails that challenge/remind you to continue us!
self direction,this is so great!,"I never thought I could learn SO much from this app! It is amazing... I encourage you to get this app and use it, for many reasons: you learn a ton, it's fun, and it's easy to catch onto- get it!!!!!"
self direction,7sassysisters,I like this app however I think that you have to know a little spanish or language that you take before you start. I take spanish and I definitely thought that it was hard at the beginning.
stimulation,Amazing!!!,"I love this app!!!  It does a fantastic job of guiding one through a language!  If you love to learn, and you don't mind a challenge, get this free app!!  You will learn so much!!!"
self direction,Amazing Language Learning App!!!!,I love this app for several reasons! I am curentlly planning to move to France/ Paris and thought I could learn French. It is awesome because it engages you. All other language learning apps sucked! LOVE THIS. MUST TRY.
universalism,Not good for beginners,"I would not recommend this app for anyone who doesn't already have a basic understanding of the language they're trying to learn. It does not teach you grammar, conjugation, or sentence structure, it only teaches you vocabulary and expects you to already know the rest. I took French in both High school and college, so I have a basic understanding. If I didn't have that, this app would be useless. If you're just trying to review or keep things fresh in your mind this app will work for you."
universalism,Fantastic way to learn a language!,"Simple to use, fun, and after a couple of days I'm understanding French, a language that I have had little exposure to before!"
stimulation,I keep getting better every day.,"I can't think of a better way to teach yourself  a new language. The challenge of never missing a daily goal keeps my practice habit going everyday, and I find myself getting better and better at understanding the language. It's sometimes frustrating when my English translation is a slight variation of the ""right"" answer and the program says I'm wrong, but it is an amazing challenge to read, write, listen and speak in another language. And because of Duolingo, I am doing them all."
self direction,Anyone can learn a new language with Duolingo. Try it.,"I am actually learning French. Not memorizing it, learning. Thanks Duolingo. I never thought that I could."
universalism,Refresher,Very easy to comprehend and a great refresher for those who know some spanish but need vocabulary practice. I also like that I can slow the playback down because I have always had difficulty understanding because those who are fluent speak extremely fast.
self direction,Fun and easy,This app is easy to use and it keeps me on track. I never thought I would learn another language until I found this app. It makes learning another language fun.
stimulation,Great!!!,Love the app. Always challenges me. I have way too many lingots though. I think the immersion articles are difficult. Even the easy ones. I like the option to just practice everything you have learned. It does not rush you and you can take as long as you want so long as you keep what you have learned up to date. :)
self direction,Great app,"Great app, follows correct order to teach a language. Italian and Spanish languages are easy to learn. 100% satisfaction. Keep up the great work. Ã°??Â"
self direction,Extremely pleased!,"This app has been amazing. I never thought I would enjoy it so much or learn as quickly as I have. I am 59, and it's been years since I tried to learn a new language. When my daughter-in-law suggested that I give Duolingo a try, I must admit that I was skeptical.  However, I find the format and the content engaging - whether I choose a short practice session or a long one. I love the stats on how I am doing, and it really encourages me to hang in there. I have nothing negative to say about this app or my learning experience. I think this might be a first! Ã°???"
self direction,one of the best apps ever.,This app is easy to use and very intuitive. Has been a great way to work on Spanish I thought I had forgotten.
self direction,Made Learning a Language Feel Like a Game,Very helpful in learning a new language. I thought it was cool how it expected you to figure out each individual word from pictures as well as using them in sentences. It felt more like a game than learnging. I would definitely recommend this app to others.
self direction,"No Japanese, not ever language is available.","I downloaded this because it came up when I searched ""learn Japanese"". A friend of mine is able to use the mobile version of this to learn Japanese so I thought my kindle could do the same. Unfortunately there was no Japanese to be learned on this app. (at the time of reviewing this 8/16/2017) It's a good thing I didn't spend any money on this because I deleted it less than five minutes after getting it.I am willing to change my rating if the app company adds a description as to what languages can be learned so people know before downloading."
self direction,Absolutely fantastic,I thought that this app was amazing! As a Spanish student already I found this app to be most helpful and it made learning Portuguese really easy for me. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn a new language.
self direction,Awesome,"I got it for my 9 year old who has been begging me to teach her Spanish. So I thought why not get her this app and she can teach herself. It is easy,  fun and she loves it!"
self direction,Great app,Love love love it!! Great refresher for my very rusty Italian!! Fun and educational! Who would have thought the 2 could coexist.
self direction,Classes are needed earlier in the day,"Love it..... but need more classes, maybe some before 3pm?  ThatÃ¢??s a lot of wasted time lol hat classes could be going on!  Most moms canÃ¢??t start a class at that time as their kids are getting out of school. This part of the app wonÃ¢??t be as successful as it could be since the times are so late in the day. Seems poorly thought out out."

stimulation,what a gift!,"When I need inspiration, adventure, or something to make my regular meal production more enjoyble this us my go to app.  It is so much fun discovering recipes that get me moving.  Having some of my favorte Food Network chefs to draw from is a gift.  Like getting lots of new cookbooks to peruse."
stimulation,Great app from Food Network,"I really like this app so far.  I believe it could be even better if there was some way to display the ingredients beside the instructions.  I dislike having to scroll up and down to look at the amounts for ingredients as I try to follow the method.  I mainly use this app on my 8"" fire tablet, so this could be a challenge to achieve.  I love being able to include my own recipes and categorize them along with the recipes I save in my recipe box."
self direction,OK,Don't watch as much as we thought we would.
power,long time fan,I have been a food network fan since day one.  That may influence me a bit.  I was very happy to see this app.  I love having the ability to save recipes to my box on food network.  I like the way things are sorted. I am sure there will be some fine tuning to come but I am very happy with it now.
self direction,Always will find some better than average recipes would recommend it to joyful cooks.,There are a few chef/cooks that are better than average on this program with different style of cook.  I find things on this site where other sites don't always give me such satisfaction in choices of recipes.
self direction,Better Recipes,We all know how to cook but these chefs give us people more recipes with more ingredients to use. Some of these recipes I have made 2 or 3 times. Take a chance I'm sure u will love these recipes even more than u thought!
power,Great product. I would definitely recommend,Works great! Show up fast. I am very happy with it I talk on the phone a lot and volume controls get real loud which I like.
tradition,food network app,I think that this app is amazing!!!! I love that I can have a recipe box and save recipes. I also like that I can look for recipes by my favouritefood network chefs. I also like the way that there are sections to help find food fast..... this is way less expensive then most cookbooks and a good inexpensive way to find recipes that will suit you and your family. The card box is much neater and faster than traditional card boxes.
stimulation,VISUAL EFFECTIVENESS,"I agree about not having enough pictures to compare my own take on recipes, (I am a recipe addict), and love to cook.  I love to challenge my ability to plate pretty and go outside the box, it would help to have more VISUAL effects to compare to!"
self direction,"Good Idea, Bad App For Kindle.",I like the concept of this app and was very excited about being able to look up recipes.  But this app worked about two times and froze.  I have not been able to get it to work since.  I downloaded onto a Kindle Fire and maybe it just wasn't as compatible as the app designer thought it would be.
self direction,Joe,This app has a well thought out format to some of the best Chefs available today.
self direction,Food Is Banging.,It had everything it said it would have. I love the type if recipes it had on it even thought i haven't made any of them but I still love looking at it. JUST BECAUSE I LOVE FOOD.
self direction,A bit disappointing.,"I loved the tv channel, so thought I would like this. I have it for my kindle, but when I try to use it, it only works for a short time, and then says that it has closed."
self direction,Never lose a recipe again. Perfect for your sidekick in kitchen.,"Great to have this easy access in the kitchen. I never really thought about adding this kind of app, but now that I have it I love it! So quick and easy to search for your favourite recipes and I don't have to go back and fourth between pages trying to get parts of recipes to cook my dinners. So much easier than navigating a web page and loads much faster than your average internet pages. My bookmarks often get deleted by my family when someone tries to erase their internet history content, so bookmarking all my favourite recipes here ensures I don't lose them!"
self direction,As great as watching it live on TV.,"Just when I thought I missed a recipe, I am comforted in knowing I have this great app accessible to my needs!"
self direction,Food Network is my favorite...,This app is so easy to use. I began exploring the very minute I downloaded it. I have several recipes ready for me to try from my favorite chefs right at my finger tips...
self direction,Not what I thought it was,Not what I thought it was ....  could not access shows
self direction,"As usual, update ruined it!","This app is pretty, has a TON of recipes, and is fun to use in the kitchen. At least, it was. As per usual, their last update screwed it all up. My recipe box-which now includes Kohl' s sponsored recipes that I didn't even choose-is a complete disaster. You select a recipe,and it pulls up another one entirely-every time. I have to look in my recipe box, then search the whole app for the specific title to be able to open it. Ridiculously annoying. This didn't start until 'Kohl' s' started choosing recipes for me. In addition, it crashes constantly and you cannot make folders within your recipe box, though it appears that you can. I have uninstalled and reinstalled hoping that would help. No such luck. I really hope they fix this app, because it was one of my favorites."
self direction,Great,"Great site, can pull up just about everything, I am only disappointed that you took my favorite off and that is Paula Deen.  Shame on your over reaction."
self direction,great ap,This is a great app. I get tips from the stars and recipes I can use and the interaction within the app is awesome.
power,Love these folks and what they can cook,Great app that.  You  want to share with friends to influence trying of new things and maybe they will download themselves.
self direction,plentiful recipes,This is a great quick app for looking up recipes. Especially getting ideas you hadn't thought of.
tradition,A Review: Food Network In The Kitchen app,"A useful app for those who wants to navigate away from the traditional printed cookbooks or recipe books.The only reason why this received 3 stars is because, at the time of this review, the login for the recipe box is non-existent. Error about &#34;... improving the log in process...&#34;If I am not logged in to my recipe box, then I have to search the recipes again that I saved."
self direction,Food for Thought,If you like cooking and like exploring and tasting different cuisine.  This is the go to network. Learn from the best in their field and  elevate your repertoire of recipes to another level.
self direction,Too much work.,I didn't get access to any of the shows that I thought were automatically available. I can't use it. Too much work to get access. Going to cancel.
self direction,Learning curve,"At first I was really disappointed because I thought that all we were able to access was the previews. I hadn't realized you have to subscribe (and was disinclined to pay a subscription fee before I was able to try out the product) to unlock the videos. I finally clicked on the subscription box and discovered that you don't have to pay until the free subscription is up. Thus far, I have watched a couple of the classes and think they'll be very helpful (once I restock the pantry!). So far, so good."
self direction,Great idea but...,I love the thought of seeing recipes from my favs but the app never works. It always forces close. I'm disappointed that I actually paid for this. I want my money back.
self direction,Invalid License - Unusable - UPDATED,"I loved this when I bought it. It would have received five stars. Useful recipes, I liked the organization. However, after a couple times of exploring the app, it told me I had an invalid license because I didn't purchase the app. Obviously I did. I'm extremely disappointed. Not worth the two dollars as it stands right now.**Update:This app is NOT compatible with Android phones if bought it through Amazon. You have to buy it through the Play Store if you want it for your phone. Would have been helpful if Amazon restricted downloading like it does foe every other app."
universalism,great app,I have been using this for awhile.  The recipes are easy to follow and my husband loves the food.  Not only can you save recipes that you like but it has a place to edit the food to your own specifications.  I have found my signature dish maybe you will find yours .  At the very least you end up with some special dishes.
power,Great so far!,"We are trying out Food Network Kitchen during the pandemic, and it's very informative.I do wish it had two things:Profiles for each family memberAndA way to select diet preferences for classes and recipes.(We are dairy-free and gluten-free due to severe food allergies. We are new to the dietary exclusions--our young son was recently diagnosed with Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EOE) after years of uncontrollable and chronic vomiting,therefore we are new to knowing which foods are substitutes for the allergy-foods.)We love food classes. No more fast-food for us! Healthy as much as we can!"
self direction,great app,"I downloaded this because I thought it was the watch Food Network app but it wasn't, so I just checked it out and I love it! Ã°??Â"
self direction,Show,It wasnÃ¢??t the show I thought.
self direction,Only a Few Problems,This app has a lot great recipes. My only complaint is that it has deleted some recipients I saved and I had trouble creating an account.
self direction,Five Stars,Very helpful in choosing the right recipe to use.
self direction,Fun new culinary ideas!,Like it very much. It's a great inspiration for creating meals when I feel most uninspired to do so!
stimulation,A Culinary Adventure,I LOVE cooking along with my favorite chefs LIVE and having a wide variety of recipes at my fingertips. I highly recommend this culinary adventure.
self direction,An app you have to pay for,I keep seeing advertisers for this app so I thought I would check it out and it just another app that wants monthly fees
self direction,Heads-up about app name,I like the app (there is so much food to cook and so little time!) but had the hardest time in finding it on my tablet after downloading it. I thought the name would be &#34;Food Network&#34; or something like that.  I hunted all over the place to find the app so I could put it in my Learning folder.  After ages I found it named as &#34;In the Kitchen.&#34;  Just a heads-up for you all!
self direction,It's not what I thought,It's not what I thought
self direction,Food network review,I am very happy with this site! Easy to use and lots of usable ideas. The only detraction is that Emeral is not listed in with the chefs!
tradition,Makes it fun to cook again,"Overall this is a great app. I'm not one who enjoys to cook, I basically cook to provide sustenance for my family.  This app makes my life easier and cooking more enjoyable for me! It's nice to find recipes that fit into our keto/low carb lifestyle.  Recipes range from ""fancy and involved "" to ""quick, easy, simple "" . I love the ability to follow the recipe in a traditional manner,  have it ""read"" to me, and to be able to watch it being made. Bonus....my family has liked everything that we have tried so far.With that being said...I only have one complaint so far. If I have watched a recipe being made and it has ended, it won't allow me to click back on to the recipe from my list of recipes.  I have to go back to ""home"" and then back to my recipes for it to work.  Besides that,  I have to say that I love the app!"
stimulation,"Not back, since I got it free.","Got a free year w my fire stick and it's okay. I like the cooking bake offs, and challenges. Many seasons and shows for both catagories. I wouldn't pay for it tho, tbh."
self direction,Disappointing,I did not realize this as a monthly subscription. I thought it was an app to watch shows from the Food Network.
self direction,Good for cooks who have that time,Not what I thought. I deleted the app
self direction,Deleted as no Paula Deen.,"Shame on you Food Network. If for no other reason, because Paula made you people a lot of money she should have been here. Her personal life doesn't change her talent nor is it a reason for you, who should have stood by her in her hour of need, to eliminate her from this app.Not only that but the case was thrown out of court as the person who sued her is white, wasn't discriminated against and had no real proof. The entire lawsuit was bogus. IMHO, an attention seeking grab by the person who sued her.Everyone makes mistakes and has to live with the consequences and I'm not saying Paula handled the whole thing well but I think she was kind of in shock and just reacted. Remember, she was agoraphobic at one time and her emotional reaction is typical of that type of disorder.Again, shame. I'll not watch Food Network again, buy any of it's merchandise or have anything to do with any chef affiliated with them. Doing what's right should never be an issue."
self direction,giuyg8iug,Did not use thought was free app
self direction,No complaints whatsoever,"I love the diversity in the recipes, there's absolutely lots of somethings here for everyone. It's been a blessing since we have so many different types of eaters in my family. Being able to see the live classes during and after has been so awesome. It's great to get to see it live, but for the not so experienced cook like myself, it's good to see it in action with the ability to pause and catch up. This app has most definitely nurtured my relatively newfound love of cooking, and I couldn't be happier with it.On the technical side, it has worked great, no problems, and I have zero complaints."
self direction,Great Resource,Love all the new recipes I tried and all the ones I want to try. Love that I can save them to try later.  Have tried a few of the the tutorials and thought they were very informative. Enjoyed. This is a great app for every level of cook or want to be cook.
self direction,"It's a great app, the only complaint I would have is ...","It's a great app, the only complaint I would have is that the video's tend to freeze and start over again. I thought it was my wifi connection but everything else runs great on my kindle.Needless to say I do like the app, I can keep the recipes I like & have a shopping list."
stimulation,Judge challenge,Just watched the judge challenge and wa greatly disappointed as to why the judges win.  You need to incourage the contenstents as they have such a disadvantage competing with judges that already have history with the judges. LetÃ¢??s get honest and give up the good oh buy network nd give some of these new chefs the due they deserve.
self direction,Better than I thought...,"Better than I thought. I like the fact that it shows you pictures of the chef, then you click them to get their recipes. There is a lot of recipes, but not overwhelming."
self direction,I am a believer,"I have to admit,  in the beginning I thought the Food Network was a crazy idea. Now its one of my favorite channels. I will continue watching to keep up on the latest and the avant-guard in the culinary arts."
stimulation,"thought i would use it, but haven't yet",more of a novelty for me
self direction,"ONE Recipe box, finally","I love this app!  It's perfect to store all of my recipes in one place.  It's such a chore to go from one website, blog, online recipe file to find the recipe you want.  Sadly I came across some of my old 'saves' to find the recipe has been deleted or the blog is gone.  This app keeps those recipes in ONE place along with my collection of pins from Pinterest.com. No more worries of loosing the recipes.A great feature of this app is that you can access the recipes offline.  This helps when you are at the grocery store to pick up the ingredients you need and there is no wi-fi.The larger Pictures and Grid View are a nice improvement.  I like having pictures for my recipes and being able to add pictures is a bonus.The added tag feature makes it even easier to find specific recipes without having to scroll through the hundreds of recipes I've saved.  (I'm actually over a thousand now:))The ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 Stars is that I can't use this app on my desktop or laptop (and currently not my Blackberry.  The app is only for Android devices).  I'd like to be able to add/edit recipes from there as I've been saving them in my bookmarks lists.  I ultimately emailed the recipes links to my email account and clicked the links from my kindle. I do understand from the Chef Tap website that this along with a cloud feature are two of the things they are working on.  Good.  I'll give you the fifth star when it happens :)  It'll be nice to share one recipe file across devices.  I've been due for a phone upgrade for awhile but I'd put it off waiting for the latest to come out.  The latest features on the new phones are great but since using Chef Tap along with a few other great apps from the Amazon App store I decided to upgrade to an Android phone instead of upgrading my Blackberry (kinda a tough thing since I've had a Blackberry for 10 years at least.)To save the backup file to my desktop I had to go through Dropbox because the app said the file was too big to send via email. This isn't really difficult so I don't count it against them.  I now use Dropbox for other things like sending my personal videos, pictures and other downloads to my desktop when I need more room :)  If you don't have a Dropbox account or don't want one you can manually save by connecting your device to your computer and saving the file that way.  The Faq page on Chef Tap has details.I recently saw from their FAQ page a way to transfer files from .txt .  This is an awesome idea I haven't yet tried.  But I will because I want to add my grandmother's recipe file.  Those are actually in a REAL recipe box on REAL recipe cards.  But that will be a project for another day.The Chef Tap FAQ page and Facebook page have lots of answers to help as well as being user friendly.  A really nice change from an app creating team:) They plan on adding new features and keep you up to date in a newsletter and on their facebook page and blog.  Looking forward to having the shopping list feature.Like I said earlier it's a GREAT app!  I don't mind the ads and usually don't but will pay for the ad-free just because the app itself is worth the money."
self direction,Fast and easy way to save online recipes !!,"I have hundreds of cookbooks however Chef Tap is  a valuable app that  allows me to save recipes as they are shown from my web searches. I enjoy exploring advanced cooking techniques and being able to save recipes with the original formatting and illustrations allows me to save them. This is easy with the free app but I like the app so much that I have upgraded to the paid version to get the additional functionality. I use my Fire in the kitchen while I am cooking and follow the instructions for the technique and use the pictures to expertly ""plate ""the food as shown in the original recipe. I am currently exploring ""sous vide"" techniques with the Joule immersion circulator and there are an increasing number of recipes online for this method."
self direction,Really EnjoyÃ¢??Although All Ã¢??ClippedÃ¢?Â RECIPES MUST BE CHECKED FOR ACCURACY,"I really like this APP.  Very addictive.  A couple of weeks after I loaded the free version, I ordered the premium packageÃ¢??to be honest, I think they wore me down with all their requests to order the premium package.Admittedly, there were many times within the first 2 weeks that I almost deleted this APP.  I would get very frustrated because I found it difficult to use.  It seemed that I could never find the specific instructions I needed.  IÃ¢??m not very computer literate.  I would finally figure it out and see how simple the procedure was.  A couple of procedures I did not find for months, and then only by accident.  Made me crazy when I discovered how simple the procedures were; showed me how little basic computer knowledge I have.One other problem I find is that frequently Ingredients and/or Directions will be missing or mixed in under the wrong category (i.e., Ingredients mixed in with Directions, or vice versa).  RECIPES MUST BE CHECKED for missing Ingredients and Directions.Now, I love pulling up recipes to try.  And I find a new, to me, helpful APP procedure almost every day.  In fact, I have to watch myself.  For someone who is a lousy cook, I find that I am very addicted to the APP and can spend hours on the APP choosing recipesÃ¢??if I allow myself.I have gone on a special gut/tummy healing diet called Specific Carbohydrate Diet.  I had never heard of this diet before (also suppose to be helpful for autistic children).  So I was surprised when this APP pulled up so many great recipes and websites.I would consider this one of the best purchases I made this last year.  Certainly one of the most enjoyable and useful."
self direction,Excellent.........,"I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE this  app!  I don't have a Kindle, just a cheap run of the mill android tablet and this app works well on it.  It is simple to use (most of the time, some websites have weird configurations),  but most of the time it's great.  The only thing lacking imo is the ability to categorize the recipes,  such as  creating folders for breads,  desserts,  beverages etc.  Worth paying for with that option added. Maybe sometime soon?  Anyway,  great job guys.  My now favorite go to cookbook  app."
universalism,Down grading for changes to a paid subscription,"You can see my original review below this update.: what was once 4-5 star app has become a 2 star due to the change over to VERY expensive paid subscription if you want to have more than 100 recipes stored. Eleven to twelve dollars a year is ridiculous, I understand they need to make some money to be able to continue to improve and support this app but the cost is prohibitive to what this app does and I refuse to pay them their current fee just to store and import recipes from the internet. And I do not buy their excuse that there is no way they can afford to keep this app running without such a high cost. They do not need servers to store all our recipes, those get stored on our devices and do not cost them a dime. Yes they want to be able to fix bugs and make improvements but please do not insult my intelligence by saying they cannot afford to do it without having everyone shell out for their price. I have far more sophisticated apps on my devices that were free. Yes many of them are supported by larger companies but this program does not require as much tinkering at say a spreadsheet or WORD document writing apps. I might consider an annual fee that actually was fair(at least a 50% cut on their current fee would be smart.) but until that time I won't be upgrading and will just go back to how I used to do it with Pintrest.To sum up; in my opinion while this is a very nice app but it is not worth the price tag they set to upgrade to the ""pro"" version.Original 4 star review:I love this app it works very smoothly 80% of the time...I downloaded all my saved Pintrest recipes with very little corrections needed and adding new stuff is a snap. Where it loses a star is downloading from personal blogs like Blogger etc..I had to pretty much retype most of each recipe myself. Now some of this is probably due to the nature of my blog which has a lot of non recipe storytelling stuff mixed into my entries. But what bothered me was the random stuff this app did not load at all. I would rather it loaded my entire blog letting me delete what I did not want than for it to pick and choose what it wanted to collect."
self direction,You need this app if you like to cook,I love this app and the fast interaction to view and save recipes. The reviews and suggestions from other users is awesome and raises the usefulness to a high level above other apps. It is useful to surf for dinner ideas when you need a nudge to be creative.
self direction,I Love This App,"Chef Tap is amazing!  If you browse recipes on the internet, you must have Chef Tap.  I enjoy the app Zite and often want to keep recipes from there and it is as simple as pressing ""share"" option and choosing Chef Tap.  The recipe is entered into ChefTap complete with photo. I have chosen to have the upgraded version that has an annual fee. It is better than a cooking magazine subscription, because every recipe is one that I have chosen. Money well spent!  Every time I bring another recipe into Chef Tap, I say, ""I love this app!"""
self direction,excellent app!,"I have amassed quite a collection of recipes on my kindle fire.  The problem was I had them on several different apps, and a ton of bookmarks and saved blogs.  ChefTap enabled me to have all my recipes in one place.  they have thought of everything I might need, and for what they haven't thought of yet, they regularly update.  Awesome job!"
self direction,5 star app,"i think this is the best app on my kindle fire. Recipes are quick and easy to import, and changing or editing them is equally easy. only one weird thing has happened-- when i imported a recipe from a text file on my laptop, it didn't correctly import the fractions. it was easily corrected and only took a minute.I do wish there was cloud storage or a pc version,  though. If something were to go wonky with my fire, it would be tough to get all this info back.Update: There is now both cloud storage and a pc version making it very easy to import recipes on my laptop. Paste the URL and the recipe is added to my kindle. All the recipes also can be accessed through my computer. I did upgrade to the premium version, so this may not be the case with the free version."
power,love it use all the time,I love this app it is my only go to recipe app and was probably the fourth one I found being unhappy with all the others. its easy to share right from the web controls are spot on and just an all around great app so get it I am sure you wont be disappointed
self direction,great app.!,"Only used it minimally, just for importing from the web. love it for searching for a recipe, importing to cheftap, then using my kindle fire to follow the recipe in creating dinner. I can see loads of potential for growth."
self direction,very good app but,"When I saw that this app was free, I tried it. I was very impressed. Its a brilliant app. I got recipes from foodnetwork.com, bbc food etc. Its quiet easy to use and very user friend. Then one day a message said upgrade to Cheftap Pro. I thought no problem, it turned out the upgrade was for $11 and you pay it every year. Outrageous but true. Once of payment would be enough, bought from my amazon.com appstore. I find it very hard  to trust with personal data. At moment I prefer amazon.com for all my buying. Had enough."
self direction,chicken caccatorie,"I just downloaded this app & I'm already in love with all I've seen. Few of the recipes weren't what I wanted yet close. Either way I found 5 recipes for what I want to cook. Yet find there are still more to go thru! I'm ready now to get started with grocery list, recipes and find out my next action I feel I need to do Alot yet ok due to everything has to b in a certain place ! Enjoy like I am!"
power,Too bad they changed it,"The way the app functions is amazing but now upgrades are required if I want to add more recipes.  I don't want to put my recipes on your server.  I liked having what I want , where I want it and under my control.  I had that until this last change."
self direction,Great for Kindle Fire,"I'm 15 years old with a passion of cooking. When I found this app, I thought, ""I'll give it a shot,"" because I'm great at cooking but not great at remembering. And I absolutely love this app! It's so easy to save recipes. I love it and so do the stomachs of the people I feed (:"
self direction,Easy interface with great functionality,"This app is simple to use and has excellent functionality.  It's perfect for collecting all those fantastic-looking recipes you find online.  Just share the page to the app and it ""reads"" to find the ingredients and instructions then imports them to the app where your can access them offline.  There's a editing feature if the app misreads a recipe.  You can set up your own categories to organize your collection.  It's well-made and thoughtfully designed.  It has been working nearly flawlessly and I recommend it highly without reservation."
self direction,Two Stars,Not what I thought is was. :(
self direction,fabulous update!!!,"I usually get annoyed with changes, but this update is great!  I now will be using this to store all my recipes from the web.  I like the drop box backup--- this app is AMAZING!!! Thank you for such a well thought out app."
self direction,another lover,I just wanted to put my 5 stars in. I love love love this app! I am so glad I found it because I have recipes saved all over the Internet. Now I can put them all in one place so easily. Whoever thought of this app is genius.
self direction,"wanted to like this product, not for $15.99/year subscription fee","The customer service is horrible.  At first I thought the customer service was horrible, because I was not a paying customer.  So I decided to pay for a year to test out the product.  My youngest son wants to be a chef when he grows up, so I really wanted a great recipe tool.  So I paid my money, and reported the software bugs to the developer.  The programmer's bug fix completed trashed my database.  Images on my tablet were deleted, and all changes that I did to recipes on my tablet were erased.  I import recipes and then modify all of them to suit my family's needs.  Anyway, the programmer's response when I told him my database was trashed was to give me my money back (which I did not ask for), and to downgrade my account from a pro version (which I legitimately paid for) to a basic version (again, which I did not ask for).  Yes, once my database was trashed, I knew that I would never renew the subscription to this product.  But now I have to do it before I hit 100 recipes instead of having a year to find the right product.This product have too many bugs that can serious damage your database of recipes.  It is not worth the price, especially when the programmer wants you have to have a 20 year relationship with his product.  Over 10 years, that is $156.  Over 20 years, it is over $300 for a simple database to store recipes.  After you reach 100 recipes in the database, you have to pay a yearly subscription fee of $15.99/year.  That is $156.00 over 10 years and over $300 over 20 years.The only software that I re-buy each year is tax software.  Everything else I pay for with a one-time fee, and I will upgrade when I believe that I need to upgrade.  If I need to synch my database on a cloud, I will do it on my own cloud.  I don't need or want to pay a yearly fee for each type of data I may want to back up on a cloud.I believe that programmers should get paid for software they develop, which is why when there is a paid version and a free version of a product for a tablet, I usually buy the paid version.  Plus, I don't want my kids exposed to ads.  But subscription software?  The product has to be a the best of the best, no stone unturned, you can't live without, level of product.  This product does not fill those requirements."
power,Great recipe app. Now works on Kindle Fire too!,"I had this on my DroidX2 and it's awesome. It can import recipes from anywhere, including photos, and gives you full control to edit everything. You can even put your own photos on the recipes. Now works with Kindle Fire which is even better to use while cooking. Give it a try, you will love it. Best recipe app in the known universe."
security,Update may contain spyware,"CMsecurity shows Spybubble in updated version during the install from Amazon.May be false positive, but I do not have the expertise to be sure.  I immediately uninstalled this app. Dev needs to be notified.April 14, 2015"
self direction,boo,hard to use.  thier is no reciepts in this app you have to down load .  I thought this would give me recipts so that i would not have to down load.  I diffently would not recommed
self direction,could not get it to work for me,"so sorry but I thought this sucked, I was unable to use it and it was a waste of time and money for me"
self direction,the best!,I love this app!! I've had no problem uploading recipes or creating my own. This is a must for anyone who loves to collect recipes. I've tried so many other recipe apps and this is by far the best!!
self direction,The Worst,"This app seemed okay at first. It even gave me a free trial to see how I liked it. And initially, it did what I needed. Or so I thought. The Ã¢??free trialÃ¢?Â is actually only about five minutes long, which wasnÃ¢??t enough time to test the sound. (I am actually not clear whether you CAN test the sound in the trial, because thatÃ¢??s how quickly it went by.) So I foolishly paid the $9.99 for the full version. Did the sound work then? IÃ¢??ll never know! Because once I input the activation code, I could no longer get the screen to even mirror. Just the same error over and over again. So I gave up, removed the apps from my laptop and TV, and I would basically like to forget this ever happened. Do not waste your time or money on this."
self direction,Can anyone make this work?,At first I thought I was too stupid or too rushed to get this app to work but then I read the reviews and saw that most others could not get it to work either. I will delete this app.
power,"Better than Nothing, sometimes","This app is very glitchy and laggy when mirroring a computer on the same network, the mirror file feature works, but if you pause the video from your remote control you have to restart it from the computer you're using to mirror. I would have been better off spending the 10 dollars for the license key on a cable to just plug my computer into the tv."
power,Froze the Firestick,"Installed on Amazon Firestick with no problem.  However, my iPhone 6s would not connect to it.  The picture on my TV would only give the AirBeamTV logo and would not allow me to use my controller for the Firestick.  Each time I would have to remove the power cord and the Firestick itself to clear the screen and plug it back together to get back control of my Amazon prime video.  After 3 attempts I deleted the app and called it a waste of time."
self direction,Get this if you enjoy being frustrated and miserable,"If you're looking to seamlessly mirror content from other devices to your TV to follow along exercise/dance videos, learn a new skill, or enjoy general entertainment on the big screen...this product isn't for you.However, if you would like to be constantly dissatisfied or disappointed, you've come to the right place! Enjoy the frequent buffering and frame skipping of an inferior product that will never be mentioned in the same breath of a ChromeCast, Apple TV, or Firestick. But who values reliability and quality anyways? Being constant is dull. AirBeam TV keeps things FRESH by spontaneously throwing in wrenches into your streamed content. This app will take your favorite videos and movies, and mindlessly chop-and-screw it until it devolves into a hot/disheveled mess that once resembled your original content. But hey, everyone loves a good remix. Remixes are awesome and always better than the original!And if you enjoy horrible customer service, you can always count on AirBeam TV to not be there for you. If you had questions or comments about the product, but are repulsed by the thought of talking to a human being, AirBeam TV will gladly send you through an infinite loop of automated responses while deferring all blame to the user. It's not enough that I've restarted my computer and modem, closed all other extensions/applications, and checked the internet connection of my TV...I probably need to give up my left kidney and bladder too for my video content to be streamed without a hitch.AirBeam TV's connectivity strength and resolution may be inconsistent, but your disappointment with the product will remain constant over time!"
self direction,Meh!!!,ItÃ¢??s free and thatÃ¢??s about the only thing I can say but for me it didnÃ¢??t do what I thought it was going to do
self direction,Works fine.,It took longer to start streaming than we thought but we were able to watch our grandson play in his college football game.  Yea
power,Ads that got stuck made this very disruptive,"It shows ads that require a controller to close and unfortunately couldnÃ¢??t control it to close them, and had to restart my stream and the airplay"
self direction,Why bother!!!,It sucks. It makes you watch videos to get five mins of airplay. Not what I thought it was going to be.
self direction,Makes native AirPlay to FireTV doable!,"It does the thing! With this installed on my fire stick, I can use AirPlay to play the videos in my Files app. I have actually been using the VLC app since itÃ¢??s easier to find airplay on it but that app requires that you also select the cast option in order to stream the video and not just audio which is weird but I super donÃ¢??t care because IÃ¢??ve been trying so hard just to find something to get my videos from iPad to tv. Others have mentioned ads, and I canÃ¢??t say whether they disrupt content yet; IÃ¢??ve only seen them between actions (from playback to stopped, etc) and thereÃ¢??s an Ã¢??xÃ¢?Â button on all the ones IÃ¢??ve seen immediately so theyÃ¢??re easy to bypass. So for me, good enough!"
power,Does not work as a means of mirroring an iOS device to a FireStick,"March 3, 2020I was looking for an app that would allow me to display photos/home videos etc. from my iPhone & iPad to a non-smartTV via my Amazon FireStick.  This app supposedly does that using the Apple AirPlay protocol built in to the newest Apple mobile devices.  I downloaded the AirScreen app onto the FireStick from the Amazon website and installed it on the FireStick according to the instructions.  According to the pre-loaded tutorial video bundled with the app, I should then have been able to go to any iOS mobile device with AirPlay enabled and from the ControlCenter, scan for other Airplay compatible device connected to the same WiFi network (which the FireStick was) and select that device and begin mirroring.  Unfortunately the app was unable to detect either my iPhone or my iPad although both had AirPlay enabled and both were connected to the same WiFi network.I then called Amazon Tech Support and spent about an hour on the line with them while they logged in to remotely view my FireStick screen and operate it remotely.  The were unable to solve the issue so the called Apple Support, making it a 3-Way conference call.  The Apple support rep remotely logged on to my iPad and operated it remotely.  Again, no one was able to make the iPad connect with the FireStick.  Since I had already tried and had the same problem with an AirPLay enabled iPhone also, it seemed unlikely to me and to the Apple rep that both iOS devices were malfunctioning but rather that it was either the FireStick and/or the app itself that was the problem.  The Apple rep came to the same conclusion, so she departed from the conference call.The Amazon rep remained on the line and we did some further checks to determine if there were any other problems with the FireStick itself, which there were not.  Every other non-AirScreen related function of the FireStick appeared to be working normally so we all concluded that there must be a problem with the app itself.I had downloaded the free/demo version of the app, which claims to function fully without upgrading to the paid version, but with advertising pop-ups.  I was not going to pay to upgrade until i saw the app work as advertised, which had it done so, I would then have paid to upgrade to the ad-free version.  Accordingly I do not know if the upgraded version would have worked properly or not.In short, this app does not do what it claims to do and therefore should be considered useless for the purpose of mirroring an iOS device to a FireTV device."
self direction,Useless to me.,"Thought it was a method to view other movies, it is not nor does it show what can be done with it. A waste of time and money."
self direction,Works and works not!,"Just bought this app and at first, it seemed to work fine but then I began to Chrome Cast from my national (Danish) tv apps and it failed totally. I also tried to Airplay and for some things it works but not for all. So Netflix works, but that's on my Fire stick. Viaplay and HBO Nordic just did not show anything. In my book, if you write a function it has to work 100%.I have Chrome Casts at home. I bought the Firestick to have a better solution when traveling. Chrome Cast is not good at hotel wifi. I thought this was the solution...."
self direction,Only worked a couple of times,"I decided to use this app because the yoga app I'm using doesn't work on my fire stick but it works on my ipad, I was able to stream a couple of times for free although there was a serious lag the last couple of times. I thought that this was maybe because I needed to purchase the app. It kept trying to load advertisements but it wasn't able to do it on my fire stick so I signed up for the free trial and now it's not casting at all. It's just a blank screen on my TV.. cancelling the subscription. Doesn't work."
self direction,Not happy with airscreen,"I thought I would be able to cast like a chrome cast from my iPhone. It does screen mirroring however, when I try to cast a program from my phone it plays only audio not video. And it only plays audio for 10 seconds and shut down with an error."
universalism,Terrible laggy quality,Poor and unpredictable cast quality when I used it to cast from browser to fire tv.Annoying ads got me frustrated and I am usually quite understanding of ads.
self direction,Does Not Work,"I at first thought that this was malware, but after looking into it I believe it just is a horrible piece of software."
stimulation,Don't waste your time,"After my initial excitement that it was easy to use and install, I immediately deleted it when the popup ads disabled the screen cast."
self direction,I have no reasonable input,"I have no reasonable input.This product really does its thing well! It gets the job done and it makes good on its word.Maybe.Or, maybe not.My daughter downloaded this..I have had zero interactions with it,other than writing this review,which I felt compelled to write."
power,Thanks but no thanks,I was hoping it would do more than just display my laptop screen on the tv monitor.Was hoping the amazon remote control would be able to do basic things like PLAY/PAUSE etcBut itÃ¢??s just a pure mirror.
stimulation,"I love the App but not the Adds, Unable to purchase on fireTV","It works great, as a DLNA Receiver for my WDTV Media server, however, I am having some challenges, upgrading to pro version"
self direction,Too Many Hoops,"I tried to stream the Peacock App from my iPhone and iPad and kept getting a notice about my ad-blocker not working. I thought this was a free app and there's not enough on-screen directions to a) enable a trial period or b) access the app settings. It was very frustrating and I have no idea why there's a ""Thickness"" rating for this app, but it was pretty ""thick"" alright."
power,Better than most,It helpful because you can control the start and stop no problems all good so far
self direction,Amazing,"Thought it wouldn't work but it does,.just a bit of interference between tap hoping but I definitely recommend getting it I give it 5 out of 5 stars for sure"
power,Nice!,This is the only one I found that had a pause and side control.It works out pretty good when I am recording!10/10Ã°???
self direction,Don't bother with Amazon Tablet,"I have the Fire HD 10.  It does not work at all.  When you press the ""Play"" button, it says the recording is pause.  I fumble with it for 15 minutes and didn't make any progress and conclude that it just doesn't work. At first I thought buying the app when help but nope!  Don't bother."
power,not recommended,"This app is not recommended for videos longer than 1 minute... In my, safe, and honest oppinion, this app is horrible. Here are some of my reasons:*It doesn't let you edit your videos,*When you pause your videos, the controls button disapears after 5 seconds of your video being paused,*When you're recording you on-screen video, if it's longer than one minute, automatically pauses and ends your videos,*If you want screen recording with your face on it, you need the pro version, which costs money,*Sometimes it will save and show your video, but it'll erase all the footage and make it from a 15 minute video, into a 0 second video,Those are my reasons. Yet, just because I mention my opinion and a lot of people agree, doesn't mean you shouldn't download the app, or you shouldn't like the app. In all honesty, this is my own opinion, and you shouldn't depend on just one bad comment."
power,Horrible,It kept making the main thing that controlled it disappear so my vids got deleted
self direction,Honeatly it was great,Good app! I thought it was useful
self direction,It sounds ok but,"I read the reviews and thought ""Wow it seems like a nice app"" so I downloaded it and I can't get it to start recording on gacha life. Does the game have something to do with it?"
self direction,Are you kidding me..,I record videos for youtube and thought this was a good app but I does not even play back my videos it just say it's unable open the video or something. Sucks!!!
self direction,It's ok Ã°???,Ok it's so glitch it's good but whenever I want to watch my vid it always says video unavailable to watch the audio is crap. But I'm probably gonna figure it out.ps my reaction sometimesÃ°??Â Ã°??Â¡Ã°???
self direction,READ BEFORE BUYING,I thought this would be the perfect app after all the reviews. NOPE!! I filmed the same video over 3 times and every time it kept saying CANNOT PLAY VIDEO!!! THE GKOD REVIEWS ARE LYING THIS APP IS SO FAME. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME U WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. Ã°??Â¤
self direction,UGGÃ°???Ã°???,"I THOUGHT that I was going to be able to record some minecraft easily, but No. I have to set stuff up with my computer. IF YOU HAVE A KINDLE, I Don't recommend.  ------"
self direction,bad don't get it,I thought I could start my own youtube videos but I realise you need to hook it up to the computer and it takes up so much space and it made me Ã°???Ã°???Ã°???Ã°???Ã°???Ã°???
self direction,Not at all what I wanted,"I thought it would record what was happening on my screen but I could never tell whether I was recording of not. Than it kept lagging and freezing up my screen. I couldn't even view the recordings I managed to get. I was able to see 1, and there was no video of the screen."
self direction,Pretty good,I thought it was a good app
power,App not ready for widespread use,"This app is but ridden. Oh screen controls not working properly, videos canning be viewed even if you mange to record one, causing screen to lock up and apps to crash. Would give 0 stars if possible."
self direction,"Please, PLEASE, fix!","Ok, so I did all the things I needed to do, but when I looked at my video, it was so glichy!! It was like the content on the screen was stretched out.. I know the people who run this app probably are  of looking but if you fix this I will rate this a five and share with my friends.  Plus I'm 11 so kids my age are into exploring that kind of stuff so PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!!!"
self direction,It's okay for others....Ã°???,"I'm not saying it's a bad app,it's got lots of directions and is straight forward.BUT for the people that don't have a root,don't have a computer,or at least can't use it,don't waste your time and money on this app.I really love this app and thought it would work by all the good reviews,but it sucks for me.And I STILL used the root! Ã°???Ã°??Â¤Ã°???. I am really trying to find a screen recorder for kindle fire..For the people that are getting this,keep in mind that it NEEDS andR-O-O-T:root!!! Hope it works for you! Best of luck.Ã°???I have just 1 request... :  PLZ MAKE A DECENT SCREEN RECORDER FOR KINDLE FIRES!!!!(HD too!!)IF SO,PLZ MAKE IT POPULAR SO I AND EVERYONE ELSE CAN FIND IT TOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Hope for the best!  -TwistyCinnamon-"
self direction,Terrible,"I thought WOW!!! I downloaded it immediately, what a big let down. It would not even load. I would turn it on and it would shut off in 5 seconds. WOULD RECOMMEND TO PEOPLE WHO LIKE TO BE RIPPED OFF!!!"
self direction,Awesome,This is exactly what I was looking for.  I thought it was going to be a scam  but it works great on my kindle.
self direction,Don't get this app,"I thought by the rating that it must be good because it had a lot of people rating 5 stars. I downloaded it and tried doing a video and when I was done, it was all messed up and you couldn't see anything"
power,:(,The controller button disappears when I close the app...
self direction,Wow. Such amazement. Ã°???Ã°???Ã°??Â,"I legit just got this and I already love this screen recorder app Ã°???. This app definitely just is so amazing and wonderful for recording on YouTube and Minecraft Ã°???. First, I never thought I would ever record on my YouTube again, but now that I have this app, I can literally do everything Ã°??Â. I very much appreciate if u get this screen recorder app Hehe Ã°??Â"
self direction,Pretty Bad But Listen.,"OK so, being a youtuber is my dream and I thought this would help me, But I was wrong. It keeps dissapearing when I'm getting into one of my games. I don't highly recommend this app."
power,Cool,"I downloaded this app to record gameplay for my YouTube channel. It works great, and the controls are easy to use. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to start, or already has, a YouTube channel."
self direction,Great for non-stop gacha vids,It's great for reaction videos and stuff and it helps with gacha life
self direction,Decently AWESOME!!!!!!!!!,"I thought this was going to be crap compared to what I've seen before, but its DECENTLY AWESOME. Just pause as little as possible or the sound will stop working.Ã°???"
power,cool,chhgvfftgfyuucycjhgcjgcjgcnhgvfchgfngcngc it up for that to you too control
self direction,Um?!,I thought it said no root needed.. SURE THING THE VERY FIRST THING IT TOLD ME TO DO WAS PLUG INTO A COMPITER. So yea how about you don't lie to the people downloading? That would be great.
universalism,Pretty Good App PS.read the warning,This app is good but at first I did not know how to hook it up so heed my warning if you're not good at understanding and following directions do not get this app but other than that it has great recording so ya hope you like it
power,Meh?,"At first I was amazing! But then, it started lagging and the controls button started disappearing. Fix it. If you dont, zero stars."
self direction,A Few BAD Problems.,"At first it was pretty good, there was a control pad with pause and stop, you can change the opacity and a lot more but one thing was annoying. The notification would not go away even when I try to swipe it, it still doesn't go away. Anyways, pretty good. I wanted to make a recording of me creating a gacha life character and when I did it it worked, but when I opened the app to see my recording, it would not open. I tried all apps to open it. Still wouldn't work. Please, I uninstalled it 4 time and it won't do what I need it to do.Would Not Recommend. Please do not get."
self direction,kindle people read this,Ok I thought this would be a really cool app because it had AWSOME raitings but it keeps on crashing I recommend kindle people should not get this app.
self direction,Not Great,"My husband spent a couple of hours trying to get the channel to work right. At first, I thought it was our Internet signal, so I went back to Sling to see if the other shows worked; they worked fine -_- for some reason, it just wouldn't stream our game, and when it did stream it, the picture quality was terrible and it kept freezing. Awful."
power,"Stick, and cube not working well.","I bought a fire tv cube, because the 2 FirestickÃ¢??s I had purchased previously didnÃ¢??t work. Where I lived previously the Firestick never even flickered. IÃ¢??m ready to return all of my products and get cable. IÃ¢??ve rebooted computer, tv and Firestick and cube. I donÃ¢??t have any receipts, just the cube box, I bought the cube and one of the FirestickÃ¢??s at Bestbuy and the other stick I cannot recall. What do you think the problem is? Is there something I should be doing? Everyone in the house use cable, I like having control of what I watch, not what the cable company wants me to watch. Also I love live sports. Please help or give me my $130 ish back. Yours truly,  Pierre Langlois"
self direction,service not available...,"not sure but it said the service was not available in my area. maybe it was just the exact think I was looking for was not available.  I live in Wyoming and get ""local"" channels (Denver and Cheyenne) thru dish network.  I was looking for the Broncos game on this app because the dish network channel was really jerky.  Thought I would try the app... disappointed"
self direction,Came In Handy At The Right Time,"I thought that I would miss the Superbowl since we do not have a cable service provider, but luckily while browsing my Amazon Firestick, an ad ran at the top of the screen which let me know that I could stream the big game right from the CBS app! Too bad the game wasn't great, but at least being able to watch it and not miss out was."
power,sports stream,"Useless, did not know how to operate the dumb thing, Missed the entire Notre Dame game, very upsettting.  Why must you people make changes sometimes the status quo is okay, tecnology  is not for everyone.  Can we view the Notre Dame game on regular channels, if not it is time to change carriers."
self direction,Only local games,I thought Ã¢??All AccessÃ¢?Â would allow me to watch NFL games on CBS not in my area...nope. It knows where you are and will only feed the local game....so waste of time and money.
self direction,Thrilled to be able to watch,The Superbowl!  Thought we were going to have to miss it.  What a nice surprise (even though the game and ads sucked - who knew?)  Thanks CBS and Amazon!  Now if we can only get the big tennis matches...
self direction,Not the best for big events,"I tried to watch the super bowl using the app, and it kept cutting out. So I thought it might be my internet, but when I watched it using youtube tv there were no problems. So I blame the app."
self direction,Not bad for a free live TV app~,"Easier than i thought, clear picture, it did go offline one time.  Too bad the game was not worth all the effort to make sure i could watch itÃ¢?Â¹Ã¯Â¸Â  I will keep the app to watch other programs."
self direction,Great download for sports and tv movies,"I loved it but didn't want to be ""enrolled"" into a subscription and pay for it.  I thought if I downloaded the channel with my fire tv stick, it would have been for free.thanks anyway"
self direction,"ease of use, quality of broadcast image",I enjoyed the ability to watch the playoff football games while working on a project in my garage and without a cable connection. My only problem was the buffering of the program interrupted some game action. The other issue I had was the quality of the resolution was not great on my HDTV. I guess there were two more issues that bother me and that was not having the ability to rewind the program so I could replay some action or record the program.
self direction,Pretty Good,Buffering was annoying...thought it was my internet but none of the other streaming apps had issues.  Other than that it was good and I was able to catch the boring Super Bowl lol
self direction,Waste of my time,"From the title of the app, I thought I could Ã¢??stream and watch liveÃ¢?Â sports.  That is incorrect.  I could watch only replays of sports news.  In order to watch sports events, you have to have a cable or satellite subscription. I guess if I were in the road and wanted to watch a random game, that would be ok. However, I cut the cable so I could stream. This app is worthless to me."
self direction,Don't bother,"Pretty much useless. Thought I could watch CBS sports network on it, but couldn't. It's just clips of shows and other stuff that's meaningless."
self direction,Eh no thanks,"Didn't really care for the app. Video quality was great but I thought this was going to be more like the Fox sports app or ESPN and it's not at all. I thought that you could view various games appearing on CBS networks for college football, yeah not so much. Uninstalled and uninterested."
self direction,Did not subscribe,"I thought I might see the early rounds of the Masters using this app. But, in order to get that coverage, I had to subscribe to it. I did NOT. Not on my budget. So, I deleted the app from my Prime Fire TV viewing list."
self direction,Not what I was expecting,Thought it was Network TV --- not  Could not see Sunday football that was on CBS.
self direction,Need to have CBS subscription,I thought I would be able to use a TV provider sign in to be able to watch games like Fox sports but it required a CBS subscription. Three stars because it's not what I hoped but couldn't comment on the actual app itself
self direction,Set it up for my stare tv for football,DonÃ¢??t use it as much as I thought I would.
self direction,Not for me. Cancel/stop,"This is not what I wanted..please cancel trial. I thought I would see actual games going on today, but could not.. stop/ cancel."
self direction,It was OK,"I thought it was a little too expensive for something  you get free with an antenna, seemed to buffer a lot."
self direction,YOU know it,Not anything like I thought it would be.
self direction,never waste your money on a useless fire stick,"It did not work, I get nothing unless I have cable and I thought that was the entire point of fire stick, If I would have known that fire stick is useless I would never have spent 80.00 for nothingnot easy to use, not easy to set up nothing works."
self direction,CanÃ¢??t watch out if market games,I thought I would be able to watch games broadcast on cbs. I could only watch what was being shown in my market. Which I would get on regular broadcast tv anyway
self direction,not what you think,not what i thought
self direction,Useless,I thought I could stream the football game
self direction,Great Product,"Great purchase reasonable prices,smooth transaction,great deals"
power,4K works better than the original,I just bought the fire stick 4K. It was to replace the original fire stick I bought a few years ago and was on a special price sale. Really my remote control for the first one just fell in water and I couldn't use it so well and compared to the 4K the old one had its day.Still getting some pixelization and buffering but far less and there are all kinds of videos to help on YouTube to even do things that people don't know fire sticks do?With the half-price sale and the quality of the stream that I get now I'm happy I spent a few more dollars to get updated to 4K
self direction,Not for me,"Not what I thought it was, really not interested"
tradition,No New Content,"I expect to be able to watch content for events not available through traditional means.  as of Jan 2020, the content was the same as the CBS Sports Channel on Hulu."
self direction,CBS sports,"If you are a sports fan any kind, you will love this app. You just pout in your interest and it will keep you on all the action and scores for your team or your sport. I would say it is my most used APP.GO BRAVES and FALCONS!"
self direction,Not what we expected,We thought we would actually see a game not listen to pre taped people talking
self direction,ESPN? There's a new better sports connection for the fans now !,"There was a time that ESPN ruled all of sports news broadcasting . But their ego has got the better of them and it's just not fun to watch , listen, or read anything to do with ESPN so I sought out a reasonable alternative and after shopping around at a lot of of the halfhearted efforts when it comes to sports scores, and accurate sports recaps and information , CBS, of all apps,  if you can believe it or not, turned out to be the one that fits my needs. I plug in all of my favorite teams and get current scores and status reports on my phone which I love. It's like I get the info before my sports buddies and it actually looks like I know what I'm talking about!! LOL. But seriously I enjoy this application on my phone , on all my tablets, and on my desktop , and they are all linked up . My teams cover a vast myriad of sports from soccer to football to Olympic action to baseball, my first love, and by the way CBS has a lot of good stats to . Can't say it's a hat that will fit everyone but it certainly works for me and I suggest everyone give it a try . Unless you work for ESPN........."

self direction,Not a Fan,"Not what I wanted at all. I thought I was going to actually watch sports, not highlights & BS"
self direction,What good is it if i have to pay to watch what i want to watch.,I thought I could stream CBS local NFL games on Firestick but I guess not.... without paying a monthly fee.
self direction,No so exciting,Thought is more games to watch instead of highlights
self direction,"Just a bunch of studio stuff, no highlights of ...","Just a bunch of studio stuff, no highlights of action, just people talking about what happened.  Not worth my time."
self direction,Perfect for the person just looking for scores,No live action. Will be removing it from my APP selection
self direction,Not for streaming,"Not what I expected. Thought it was for streaming sports programs; if that's what you expect too, skip this. I think CBS wants us to pay for all access."
self direction,One Star,I am not paying for another station. I thought I could access it with my fire stick.
self direction,Not what was expected,"My husband downloaded this app because he thought it was connected to CBS's fantasy sports, it isn't.  It has the scores, etc. but it isn't what he thought it was.  I can't rate it as good or bad, as it wasn't what he expected."
self direction,Not that great,This APP wasn't really thought out before it was launched..very hard to find actual shows..mostly clips.
self direction,Two Stars,didn't do what I thought it would.
self direction,Very good at what it does,Very good app for folks interested in sports results.  Allows you to tailor searches to get immediately what you are looking for.  Very well thought out presentation.  A quality app.
self direction,Disappointed,I thought I would be able to watch Boise state games and games on CBS Spots. I canÃ¢??t so it was a waste of time for me
self direction,No football,Not what I thought it was I canÃ¢??t watch and football games
self direction,Works very nicely. Lots of information available,"Quick updates, fairly intuitive to use.  Works very nicely.  Lots of information available.  Makes my Kindle seem more powerful than I thought it was.  Highly recommend."
self direction,Not what I expected,"Based on the name of the app, I thought I would see actual games but it is only commentary."
self direction,College Football,"We thought we would be able to stream a college football game.  No live games, very dissappointing."
self direction,Dislike,Wasn't able to watch the Football game on Sunday..Thought this app was free.
self direction,misleading,thought they were streaming a sport program but they were not.

self direction,No good,Not what I thought it was. No real sports in it
tradition,Awesome Super Bowl Experience On FireTV,"Great app for watching Super Bowl 50. I was texting friends during the game, so I was aware that I was just a few seconds behind the live TV broadcast, which is actually amazing for a live feed with so many viewers, I had expected it would be worse. And for me, a few seconds was totally fine since we only texted gossip about the halftime show and not the actual plays... Amazing opportunity for me (who refuses to get cable TV or any traditional TV for that matter) to be able to watch Super Bowl from home instead of heading out to a crazy bar. I also loved that the advertisements were the same ones as on TV. Previous years' Super Bowl apps were slower and didn't have the real ads. Well done!"
self direction,Easy to Find your Favorite Sports Team,Love it.  Very easy to use and get the latest scores and even play by play action.  We have installed it on our phones and tablets.
self direction,Easy to operate through choices!,I liked the live tv. Also thought some of the highlight reels were great. Thanks.
self direction,CBS Sports great,I thought they were great. The fact that this came with Amazon Fire TV just claims my statement.
power,Scores and highlight features.,I can track the status (scores and highlights) of my favorite football teams

self direction,One Star,I still can't see anything...thought it was suppose to work anywhere....
self direction,No streaming live tv,Thought I could stream live tv using this app but it didn't seem possible once I opened it.
self direction,This app does not stream well and stop constantly. ...,"This app does not stream well and stop constantly. I have fiber 1G of speed and at first thought it could be related to the internet. But all the other apps were streaming live programs without a problem, so it must have been the CBS app that was not working properly."
self direction,A Great Sports App,"This is a great app for people who want a quick way to check the score of their favorite teams.  Simple, easy to read, interface.  No special signup (unless ESPN) is required.  Live game tracker so you can keep up with all of the action when you are on the go."
self direction,Needs improvement,"I downloaded this app in hopes I could use it to watch the Super Bowl in HD through the Fire TV Stick. I have Charter high speed internet clocking in at 60mbs, but this app had terrible lag. The video was terribly out of sync with audio. I thought it may just need reloading so I exited the app several times during the pregame show and even restarted the Fire TV Stick. Nothing seemed to work. We ended up watching the game on our TV using an antenna. Couldn't be more disappointed."
self direction,Super Bowl 50,"I don't have cable. I'm an old-school cord cutter (dropped cable back in 2007 - haven't even missed it and have saved thousands of dollars over the years not having it). So I heard you could ""Watch Super Bowl 50 LIVE with the CBS sports app"" ---- I thought ""yeah right"".... Low and behold, I downloaded it the morning of the game, and I'd say around 2pm ET I clicked ""watch now"" on the app and there it was.... pre-talk and commentary all the way up until the game, and then the game itself. No buffering/streaming issues and fantastic HD picture quality. I was pleasantly surprised."
self direction,Three Stars,Thought it would be in HD
self direction,My go-to app for up-to-date scores in almost any sports event!,"My favorite sports scores/news app on my iPhone!  Much better than anything from ESPN (go figure) or anything else I've tried. Very clean interface and well-thought out menus, including saving favorites and watching scoring updates for games in progress. For a free app, it has a minimum of ad banner noise. Highly recommended!"
self direction,Great work CBS,"I thought the production of the Super Bowl was very well planned out and executed with great care and professionalism. I liked that it pretty much looked like it moved right along. Even the half time show seemed to get in and out and still be memorable. Oh,  ad my wife's cousin setting an NFL record 61 yard punt return was icing on the cake."
self direction,I love CBS Sports,"CBS Sports is great - Best place to check on all the scores and follow ""live game action"" !"
self direction,Not useful for me,I could only get yesterday's comments on games by guys I never heard of. Thought I could get the KU game live. Not useful for me.
self direction,Lousy,I thought that I was going to get to watch the games.  I only get the scoreboard.  What a letdown!A sad fan
self direction,Second CBS App Fail,"I thought there would be live sports coverage, especially since I subscribe to CBS. This is the second CBS app fail on my fire TV (the first being the CBS app). Get it together CBS! I deleted it within five minutes."
self direction,Not what I expected,I downloaded that app because I thought we can watch live games but I guess we can't we that app.

Not only do I get to watch what I want but I don't have to spend an arm and a leg just to watch a few channels. It's easy and to install and get this app. I enjoy having all the control over my television, all you need is an internet connection and then you are good to go. And you also get 1080 p with it.

self direction,Sports Lovers Must-Have!,Me and my family really enjoy having CBS Sports and are so happy that we never have to miss out on any of the sports action anymore!
stimulation,Completely useless on FireTV devices,"This is two different apps depending on the device, so pay attention to the app description above to see if you'll be one of the 5 star or the 1 star folks. On phones and tablets it is a full featured app with live streaming and things like bracket challenges. On the Fire TV devices it's a horribly useless app where you can only stream seemingly random clips from different shows, but no live streaming. This makes one of the most useful use cases (streaming the live game that is being preempted by a game running late) for TV devices a no-go. It's not like this is a premium paid channel, so blocking from streaming while freely broadcasting makes literally no sense."
self direction,it's up and it's good!,"Hands down this is the best of the sports apps out there.  I would have thought Espn would have been best, but CBS takes home the trophy."
self direction,Horrible App,"The app sucks! Misleading, when I downloaded, I thought I would be able to watch something that was advertised. I thought I would be able to find it from the landing page, but couldn't find what was shown."
self direction,Not what I thought,It's not what I thought it would be. Just a bunch of commentary when I was looking for a certain  bball game
self direction,Not included,I downloaded it because I thought it was part of my xfinity package. Turns out there is a monthly fee. I uninstalled it
self direction,Waste of time and effort,I got this because where I live I do not have access to cable and satellite is too expensive.  I do however have high speed internet through a program with ATT.  it is their home phone with added internet.  This internet is only available to rural households that do not have access to cable.  I only get 50 gigs but it is enough for now.Anyway once app is installed you get about 5 minutes preview then you have to sign up....No problem I thought...Wrong.  When you sign up you have to sign in with your cable tv provider.  That is ridiculous.  If I had a cable tv provider I would have Fox and not need this app...  what the hell is the purpose
self direction,Good App,I liked being able to watch hockey games from the beginning and pausing the action when necessary. Very useful app. One thing I wish you could do is move forward or back by more time than the program allows. Have to hot the fast forward button to many times.
self direction,Could not find a Guide,There is not a Guide to inform you where to look for what you are wanting to watch.  We thought that our Seahawks game would be on this station as DirecTv has discontinued the Fox Network.  But could find the game.  Maybe an explanation of what is included in the subscription would be wise for other viewers.
self direction,deceptive at best,"I thought I had read all the small print, so last week I started watching the Cal/Stanford Big Game.  In the middle of the second quarter the transmission stopped and a message popped up that I was finished with my free view and would have to pay to see the rest of the game.  NOT HAPPY"
self direction,Bad Video,"I wanted to watch the Super Bowl in 4K by using this app on my new Samsung Q90 tv, but quickly switched back to my normal cable tv source.  The video was frequently stopping and we didn't want to miss any of the action.  I think their servers were probably overloaded that day.  I don't watch a lot of sports, so I haven't tried it since then."
self direction,Worked Great but I did not unsrstandhow it worked,"I thought I could see all the FOX programming and that I could only do if I had gone through my cable provider, which I have no interest in doing. Once I got that it worked great. The stream lost itself a couple of times but not so bad I could not enjoy the Super Bowl."
self direction,I an not a big enough sports fan to want to watch a game that is already over.,"We thought we could receive current games, games in progress, with the Fox Sports feature, but it appeared to us the feature was for games and news about games that occurred in the past. It appears ESPN was about the same thing and we were not interested in it either."
self direction,We had two televisions in two rooms to allow our Super Bowl party guests to spread out,Too long a delay between live action TV broadcast and that seen using the app.  We had two televisions in two rooms to allow our Super Bowl party guests to spread out. One TV was connected to FIOS and the other to internet app.  Everyone came to the live TV because the delay was unacceptable.
power,Disgusting network,The Fox Network couldn't control their hate speech in their Fox ads.  Someone else please buy the rights to the Superbowl so I can avoid these racists.
self direction,Way too many ads!,Great picture and streaming quality. Putting-up with the continuous banter was one thing but letting Fox slam as many ads on at half time was typical Fox. Almost as an afterthought there was a small amount of recap and commentary squeezed in. Shame.
self direction,poor image quality w lots of skips,"poor image quality w lots of skips, occasional slo-mo streaming. Thought poor image quality may be my wifi signal, but a Netflix flick immediately after streamed smoothly. Also hard to figure out how to get rid of CC, which was on by default and greatly annoying for being 10s ahead of the video, but eventually found the right button to shut off on the Amzn remote."
self direction,"Well that was useless, since we already have FoxSports1 throught Direct TV","We were trying to figure out a way to disconnect from Satelitte TV and thought this app would help through our Amazon Firestick.

self direction,Needs suspcription,"I thought it was free, you need a subscription."
power,Very Frustrating App,"The fast forward controls only allow you to skip forward about 6 seconds at a time.  It then takes about 4 seconds to load before you can fast forward again.  I watched a recorded game and had to restart.  It lost my place and I had to pickup from the beginning.  It took most of an hour to fast forward to the 1.5 hour mark.  I would give a lower rating, but the streaming quality is fine if you watch from beginning to end."
stimulation,"Couldn't watch without it, challenge to watch with it","I'm giving this app a 3 because without it I couldn't watch some replays on demand.  With that being said, watching is quite a challenge as the program continually freezes for short periods of time while watching.  It's by far the poorest quality app I use."

The quality when I was streaming to my phone was pretty good, although it had a slight problem with stalling out when my phone thought there might be a WiFi connection around.The website has tons of information, but is not super intuitive, unless what you want to watch is the main featured match. It took me some time to figure out where I was going when I wanted to watch the current live match, but didn't necessarily know who was playing in that live match. It would be helpful if they made a clear distinction between games you can watch after the fact (and there are a lot of them) vs games that are live.Subscribing (and then ending my subscription) was quick and easy."

self direction,This app made me hate using my FireTV Stick!,"Massively frustrating! The screenshot in the Amazon App Store should be a gif of turquoise circle spinning! This app consistently freezes after 30-60 seconds with every game I watch. After it freezes, I'll hit the back button, select the game I want to watch again, it will play for 30 seconds and BAM - spinning turquoise circle! Sometimes, if you wait for a minute or two, it will eventually start playing again for another 30 seconds, and then freezes again.In my experience, this is the WORST streaming app from any cable channel or broadcast network. I have such a negative attitude towards this app that it's bled over to my feelings about my FireTV Stick. Since the NBA season started this year, I've been using my FireTV Stick less and less and using my Roku more. Now, I almost never use my FireTV Stick. The only time try to use it when I try to watch the Mavericks play.  I noticed that I was using the Roku almost exclusively a while back, but I couldn't really figure out why. Outside of FSGO, I was using mostly the same apps on both devices. But the more I thought about it, the more I came to realize that it's because this app is making me associate a bad experience with using my FireTv."
self direction,Mobile Access is Cool,"Pro...Got me access to the game, and looked great on my phone.Con...action would stop for a few seconds, then continue. Happened throughout the game"
self direction,Lousy update!,"Both Fox sports go and Fox now both updated to a version that will not work right on a Kindle Fire (7th generation, so fairly new).  Takes you from the app to Fox website, which does not work well.  Keeps ""play"" arrow circle in the middle of the screen even minutes after you hit play. Also does not have all the options for forward and rewind.  When you go to ""having trouble?"" , it just says this is a beta version and they are working on bugs.  I thought beta testing was supposed to be completed before you forced that version on everyone.  Previous version was great for both apps - don't know why they have to 'fix' something that isn't broken.By the way, I was having the same problems on my laptop, so you can't blame it on Amazon!"
self direction,Access denied!,Through a contract dispute we lost Fox network and I thought we would be able to watch football games on this. After my free trial was over I was informed I didn't have access.

self direction,Stutters and freezes all the time,"I don't use this terribly often, but I've been using it to watch post-season baseball, and this app is terrible.  I thought maybe it was my wifi signal, but it doesn't have any trouble streaming NLDS games on TBS (or anything on Netflix, for that matter). I connected my fire tv via ethernet just to see, and it wasn't any better.  Please make this better, because right now, it's basically a worthless app.  It stutters and freezes so much that it's intolerable to watch anything on it."

self direction,FOX Sports GO app,"Let me start off by saying that I have very fast internet and my streaming device is Ethernet connected.  Now of course I downloaded this app to watch the Super Bowl this year, just like many other people did.  It started out working great but then after halftime it started to buffer and then eventually the stream was lost for quite some time.  Lucky for me I had other streams I could turn to in order to watch the game but I thought the FOX stream would have been the way to go."
self direction,Ease of finding what we are looking for,This was not what we thought. Did not go into it.
self direction,Frequent channel buffering and pixelated video,"I was pretty excited when I first tried Fubo TV.  They have a wide selection of channels including the local sports channels I no longer have with my limited cable lineup.  Unfortunately, during my free trial period I experienced a lot of problems with the video being pixelated.  I thought it was just one channel, so I switched to the Weather Channel.  It worked well for a while, but then began to do the same thing.  This issue occurred while at my vacation house.  When I got home I installed the app on my Amazon TV.  There were no pixelation issues but no matter what channel I watch, at some point the video freezes and buffers.  This some times only occurs for a few seconds and other times I have to close and re-open the app.  It's too bad this channel doesn't appear ready for Prime Time.  I was looking forward to consolidating my video on Fubo and getting rid of Hulu and Sling.  Looks like at the end of the month I'll be getting rid of Fubo."
self direction,One of the worst functioning Fire Tv Stick apps,"I'm doing a free 7 day trial of FuboTV on the Amazon Fire Stick I've had for about a year now. I've tried a lot of streaming apps but this one just won't stream without difficulties.  My WiFi router is a few feet away and Fast.com says I get about 35-40Mbps, and everything else I watch works fine, but I can't get Fubo to go more than a few minutes. When I Was watching Dr. Who live Saturday night it woudln't go more than a minute w/o freezing, stuttering, dropping to SD, having the sound go but the picture freeze. My wife thought maybe it was just b/c Dr. Who was live streaming, so tonight we tried DC Legends of Tomorrow from a few weeks ago. It worked much better than Dr. Who, but about halfway through the screen went black but the sound kept going. Then everything stopped. Then it jumped back a bit. Just awful. I'd blame it on the WiFi or Fire Stick but really over a year of so many other services I've never had any problems like this.One thing which did work for awhile was hitting the Options button and changing the resolution to 480p from Auto in the drop down box. It didn't look very good but at least it played after that.I'll be stopping Fubo after the free trial and going back to watching The CW shows for free on The CW app. It has commercials, but it works like it should.If you want live streaming but don't need The CW channel PS Vue seems to be the best service out there right now. Not cheap, but the best experience. Philo is cheap, but the app is lacking. It does work though, unlike FuboTV."
self direction,Getting Closer,"WHAT OTHERS HAVE MARKED THIS OFF FORContinuing to charge them after cancellation: I am continuing my subscription, so I cannot comment on this.Freezing: I watched the third place World Cup game and had no issues. I watched Leicester v. Man U and it only froze once when I took it to mobile and left the house. A few other PL games on NBC Sports have frozen for a minute or two. But overall, I do not get what others talk about when they say that it is so terrible. Even cable has its moments, sometimes much worse.Bad picture: Looks fine to me. Maybe the first ten seconds aren't great, but again, isn't that true with almost anything?Slow loading: Okay, here I have a hack. When I start fubo.tv from my Amazon Fire TV homepage, a loading circle comes up, often with the fubo background, but not always. It will rarely come out of this by itself. But I have noticed that if I press the back button, it immediately snaps out of it and doesn't take me back but instead takes me directly to fubo. Odd thing, but in the end, it's fine for me.You cannot rewind a live game, the way that you can on NBC Sports apps or Fox Soccer Match Pass, et al: Accurate. Goals may happen and you won't be able to see them if you are not there at the exact time or you didn't record it.MY MARKDOWNSPremier League: You think that you are getting NBC Sports, Bravo, USA (?)--every possible network you could in order to watch the Premier League (aside from the money-grubbing NBC Sports Gold). But you forget the obvious: NBC. It comes with your local Fox and CBS, but not ABC or NBC. I have found articles on fubo that say that with the TVEverywhere app, you can log-in to the NBCSports app with your fubo credentials and it will treat it like a cable subscription. This has not been the case for me. I am not clear why I was rejected, other than a message that said something like ""We're sorry, this provider does not have retransmission rights in your region"". From a fubo page, it appears that NBC in my market (Oklahoma City) is not carried (while others like Tulsa and tons of other markets are). I have confirmed this both on the NBC Sports site and on the app, where I have received the same message. So if I were 90 miles to the NW, then I would have this? This is not progress. The fubo article also says that I must have the TVEverywhere channel in my fubo subscription in order for this to work, yet when I search fubo packages for this channel, I find no such listing.Champions League: Heads up--I thought that I would be getting TBS & TNT, and the last I heard, the Champions League was moving to this family of stations in the coming year. But those are not actually included. I just overlooked it.How to make this better: NBC sucks. When it split its games across NBC, Bravo, USA, NBC Sports, it could act like it is helping the fan, but then when it puts some things on a platform like fubo and others, like NBC, not, then that's a big pain. It is either mistakenly not considering this or it is intentionally doing this for its own benefit to make things like this more cumbersome for the consumer, hoping that they buy something like fubo/sling and cable on top of it. I look forward to when NBC and others catch on to how they could make even more money by making life easier for the consumer rather than harder. After all, I hardly watch American football at all anymore. Everyone can turn you off.But what does that mean for fubo? I would like to see fubo make it easier to see NBC, or to at least have my questions answered. It knows that I want to see the Premier League. So list every game. When I click on it, tell me that it is on NBC Sports or Bravo, which I have, and take me there. If that particular game is on NBC Sports Gold, tell me that, and maybe NBC will pay for that ad. If it is actually on NBC itself, then give me a brief and clear instruction on how to watch NBC, and if I cannot, then please tell me why.I also don't find the guide that helpful. I prefer not to look at what is on TV currently because by the time you scroll through all your channels, if you want to go back up to the top and watch something that you saw up there, it takes so long just to get up there. I wind up perusing just the networks, where it lists them in rows of four, which allows me to scroll through to the channel that I want faster, if not the exact programming.WHAT IT GETS RIGHTI watch mostly BBC World News, HGTV, and sports-related channels. The Fubo network is pretty good--kind of like ESPN classic for soccer, but without actual game film. It also has Bein Sports, which has worked well the few times that I have watched it so far. The website is also pretty good.OVERALLIt does great with giving access to French and Spanish games via Bein Sports, which is nice. However, it offers access to only roughly 1/2 of Premier League games, due to some being on NBC itself and some being on NBC Sports Gold. And it does not offer Champions League games in English at all, although worldsoccertalk.com appears to say that I could watch Champions League and Europa League games in Spanish on Univision, which is on fubo. I don't have a problem with that if it will really happen. But what I want to see is an option where you can click on the sport and then the competition; it does have this, but if I am to judge by that, then that points out a few things: (1) No Serie A; (2) No Champions League or Europa League; (3) just 5/10 Premier League games on this particular weekend.As a stand-alone service judged compared to cable, I am pleased with this. It doesn't give you everything, but it does give you some international soccer extras and things like CBS Sports. Comparing to something like Sling, it appears that Sling wins on your regular cable networks, though they are comparable. But if you are really a big soccer fan, understand that you are basically comparing Bein Sports  $10 to TNT/TBS & ESPN, aka La Liga and Ligue 1 to the Champions League and whatever soccer ESPN offers. If you care a great deal about Mexican and South American games, then that will push up fubo in your eyes."
tradition,Best steaming TV I've had,"I'm stunned by all the negative reviews for this service. I've run the gauntlet of streaming TV services. PS Vue, directTV now (AT&T TV NOW) sling tv and hulu  live. By far Fubo is the best I've had for many reasons. The best thing I'll say for fubo is this is the one I've had the least buffering with and I mean by a long shot. All of the other services were at times completely unwatchable. I've only had fubo buffer on me a few times for like a few seconds and never more then once in a night of viewing. Plus it's got the best channel lineup of any. The picture quality is noticeably better then the others I've had as well. It is a little pricey but still much cheaper then traditional cable."
self direction,Fubo is Poor Service or No Service!,"Fubo was a mistake! Thought I would be able to watch the Super Bowl however it was only available in Spanish ( commercials were English), had to place a call to them 3 times then finally was on HOLD for nearly 25 minutes just for them to tell me the ""English"" version was not available to my area. This wasn't the first issue with them, I am disgusted with Fubo, save your money because Fubo IS NOT worth the fee they charge. I subscribed but as soon as my subscription comes due I will be cancelling. No Super Bowl for us.. READ the reviews available on google, Don't waste your money on Fubo"
self direction,Worse Ever,"We have used this service for the last 5 months.  The attraction was getting Redzone, that being said the quality of the broadcasts are poor at best.  We have a 1g Wifi plus the smart tv is connected via Ethernet.  The ability to navigate the home screen with Samsung remote is not intuitive at all.  It doesnÃ¢??t matter if you record or watch something live, the app seems to buffer excessively.  Watching the Super Bowl put us over the edge.  The picture was highly pixelated and images were indistinguishable.  As soon as our month is over, we are done.  Very disappointed. And it is not cheap.  We are going to do Apple TV."
power,Not quite ready for primetime,"I'm currently in the FuboTV seven day trial. Thus far, I've found a few bugs in the Fire TV app. (At least, if you're using the Fire TV Game Controller.) Pause, fast forward and reverse do not work. On the game controller, pressing the ""A"" button pauses Amazon, Sling, DirecTV Now and Playstation Vue playback. It does not, however, work with Fubo. Additionally, if you exit playback mid-program, there is no ""resume"" feature. Conversely, playback on a PC has no problems whatsoever. I just much prefer watching TV on an actual TV. (And yeah, I know, I can ""cast"" from my computer.)DVR recordings are limited to only 10. That's something I can live with because I'm only recording motorcycle racing on Bein Sports. That said, if I was using Fubo as my primary streaming service, that would be a deal breaker.As for image/video quality, there are no issues. It's on par with all of the other streaming services (aside from Amazon with their AMAZING UHD 4K playback.)I suspect FuboTV will fix their Fire TV app quickly, so I'll probably try them again in a few months. They are definitely on the right track, but the Fire TV app is certainly in its infancy."
power,Cable? Satellite? Why bother!,"We cancelled our very expensive satellite TV subscription. We bought antennas and Fire TV set up on both of our televisions. They canceled BEIN sports on most satellite providers, but FuboTV has 12 BEIN sports channels. My husband has more football (soccer) than he can watch. I get all of the channels that I ever want or need to watch. Don't wait to switch. The antennas are a cinch to hook up. The Fire TV is fool proof. I am very, very impressed with the set up. Our Alexa remote is a universal remote, controlling the TV and soundbar. FuboTV is inexpensive and has an amazing channel line up. Check it out!"
self direction,Good cable/satellite replacement,"I recently moved and have been unable to get suddenlink cable or directv or dish satellite services to provide service at my location (too many trees for satellite and the cable company is a joke, won't even provide a quote to extend service) so I began exploring cable alternatives.  FuboTv has a great selection of channels and it works on the devices I have.  The stream quality has been decent with the limited bandwidth I have (approx. 15mbps) and the picture quality is good most of the time.  I suspect this has more to do with my internet provider than it does the FuboTV service, I will try to update when my speeds get an upgrade in a month or so.  The cost isn't bad, but when compared to other services, it is probably about $10/month higher than it should be.  I WOULD recommend this to others as a good cable/satellite alternative."
self direction,"All Good, THEN NOTHING!","I thought things were going well, good reception, clear picture. Then it paused like it was uploading more content, then stopped completely! After rebooting the internet and the TV, the channel said the content was no longer available in my area and it quit broadcasting...... Indians vs Yankees game #1. I'm not sure what took place, but I will seriously consider cancelling any further subscription services."

Exactly the package that I need which Sling, PS Vue, You Tube TV, Hulu, Direct TV Now donÃ¢??t provide for this price.Here are my thoughts on the 2nd day IÃ¢??m using it. I have 200MB internet speed and a pretty good tech environment at home.Windows version is good.I mostly use, if not all the time Amazon Fire TV. Honestly, it looks like it is in beta version at most.Lots of buffering and pixelation. If youÃ¢??re based mostly on sports, this is the most important feature. On live games, it worked better streaming on Chromecast from my phone.Stream Quality is not 1080p and 60hz on most of the channelsNot easy to surf the channels. I have to go back to the list to choose another one, when it should be the option to see whatÃ¢??s on the other channels while IÃ¢??m on the current one.When I go back to the schedule, it defaults to Fox, the very first channel on the list and I have to scroll all way down if I want to go back to where I was previously watching.To make things worse, when I scroll up and down the list and I click the left side of Fire remote, it selects El Rey by default, no matter where I am. By now IÃ¢??m completely lost of where I want to go.Close Captioning are horrible. 1 - There is no way to personalize the fonts, background etc. Too big and cover good part of the screen. 2 Ã¢?? They have to be selected on each channel and they donÃ¢??t stay on when I change them.DVR is not available on Fire TVOn live sports tab, I clicked on Germany Ã¢?? Mexico game and something totally different showed upRW & FF donÃ¢??t work.So, it needs some workSince there is no remote with numbers and no numbers assigned to channels, should be some kind of grouping, same as you have for sports. Sorting by News, Movies etc, depending on whatÃ¢??s on now and the channel type.Internet version on chrome is way better.It should be an option to add favorite channels and to be able to sort them to our preferences. Scrolling up and down itÃ¢??s too much time consuming.IÃ¢??ll keep Fubo for couple of months until the next soccer season starts and hopefully things will change, especially streaming quality.If I want buffering and low resolution games, I can find plenty of websites that show them for free.IÃ¢??m rooting for you guys. I really, really like what you got going."
self direction,Disappointed,"We are very disappointed because we thought we could get all of the NY Giants games (we've lost Fox on Direct TV). It sounded like the game on Sunday 9/22 would be streamed, but it wasn't.  We also found it difficult to navigate the app, but that could be our lack of experience.  All in all, we ended up paying for a month's viewing that we won't use and have discontinued the service. In our opinion, it was a case of false or misleading advertising."
self direction,Fine if you don't have cable,"A long way to go before I cut my cable.  Very clutsy interface and not user friendly.  Had lots of pixilation and drop in picture quality.  Support is poor.  NO ABC so my wife hated it.  Some of the games I wanted to watch were not available but I could stream them on my iPad.  Cloud service is basic and problematic -- can't fast forward while recording in session, cant programs until they are scheduled.Thought I hated my cable until this!"
power,Good choice of channels but recording forward and back needs improvement,Fubo is almost the only choice if you want to include NFL Network in your channel lineup. But the DVR controls for forward and back don't show a screenshot of where you are in the program so it's pretty useless. Other live TV apps have a better interface. We also had some stalling and slow start up with this app. We are going with a competitor even though they have less channels.
power,Best streaming service for us,"We cut the cable; tried YouTube TV, Sling and then FuboTV; I had never heard of these guys;  Sling is owned by Dish, and they are who we dropped; service was OK; didn't like their channel guide and controls; YouTube TV had the worst controls; it took us awhile to get used to FuboTv ; they are a bit more expensive but so far we happy with the service; our ISP is Century Link and are not having many issues with buffering;"
security,Great picture. Stable. Live local TV and NFL red zone but no CNN?!?!,"I got Fubo specifically for NFL red zone and local live TV. Those were my must-haves. The interface and picture quality is good and the channel selection is OK, except no CNN!?!? Not happy about that. Very happy with the stability and picture quality, though. ItÃ¢??s at least equal to Verizon fios cable TV. Might be better."
self direction,"Adequate ability, good for sports","FUBU tv is just ok, it's very ambitious which is good, but it's layout is lacking a well thought out navigation.  Leaving you to search for specifics to watch. It replays commercials over and over, so annoying. The price really sets this as out of usable for less money I would choose Hulu live or YouTube TV."
self direction,Base price is $55.00 per month,"When I saw this searching for a method to watch the Woman's World Cup; I thought it was too good to be true.  The channel seemed to be free.  I downloaded it and was directed to the signup website and after entering my email there I was presented with billing options.  The lowest one was $55 per month.All I wanted was to watch a few World Cup matches; I would gladly pay $15 or maybe $20 to watch any or all the matches in this years World Cup.  I even would be ok with $3 or $4 per match I wanted to watch.  If I wanted to spent this kind of money I would just get cable again.I never completed the signup.  I do not care what else they offered, I wanted 1 thing and they where extremely overpriced for that."
self direction,"Not bad but, definitely needs some improvement.","So far this app has worked fairly well for me, had some buffering issues at the beginning but that was due to my slow internet service which eventually was fixed, the price is really fair for what is provided, I was paying before over $120,00 a month and I didn't have any sport channels other than just ESPN, that's why I dropped Direct TV. The only thing negative I can say for now is the ""Subtitles and Captioning"" that had recently been popping up on some channels, not sure thou if it is the TV networks but, that is annoying if you're watching a game, don't really have any options of function controls, so far I've having been able to figure out how to  get rid off the subtitled, in addition to it I also wish fubo TV will add on more sport channels, out of the 11 channels provided, 5 are about movies that no one cares about, I hope that fubo TV will improve it's service for more customers's satisfaction."
self direction,Content is good if you can get it working correctly,"Works ok. Had problems with pausing a video and having it start completely over and you can't fast forward. Also had problems with it recording shows that were labeled wrong. I clicked on the show that I recorded and it's a different show, under the show I thought it was', title. I like the channels it has though... when they work and don't show the loading circle."
self direction,Not as advertised,"The ad said I could watch the game. Yeah, it records the game and you get to watch it after ""the live event"". Then they want $45 a month? I don't think so Tim. I thought I could watch a live game. This app didn't even make 24 hours."
self direction,DON'T DO 7 DAY TRIAL VERY CONFUSING,DON'T DO 7 DAY TRIAL VERY CONFUSING doesn't Bring you to parts of the app where you cant get out of the trail until it shows up on your bank statement $64.00/monthly. And is somehow ties to ESPN. Even called tech support they had no answers??? Hours on the phone-still not resolved. More hours on the phone today. Major point; There is NO one place you can find everything you can find about ALL of your apps on Amazon five TV. SO if you get charged first get the bank transaction number. Then call Amazon and they say they will take it off.
self direction,Quite Pricey!,I thought I would try Fubo tv since I just cut the cord. I just wanted the Paramount Network channel. $54.99 per month is a bit pricey though. I think IÃ¢??ll be canceling prior to the end of the 7 day trial.
self direction,A little pricey...,"For the price, I thought I'd be able to watch ""on Demand"", but that's not the case.  You can record a few hours though.  Given the choice between this and Cable Tv, I'd take this."
self direction,Fubo has AT&t Sportsnet!,Fubotv is awesome. It has excellent sports package and regular TV combinations. It's the only service that has AT&t Sportsnet for rockets and Astros action.
security,Helps the anxiety of cutting the cord. Premium pricing but so far so good,We recently decided end our cable television service. Opted for Internet only from our provider and then play for this service. So far so good. You get a suitable amount of broadcast television. The sports packages is great.The stability has been very good so far
stimulation,It's fabulous!,"It's easy to get into. I'm ""technologically challenged,"" so I get frustrated easily, and this is a hell of a lot easier than youtubetv!"
self direction,FUBOTV,I have fubotv for over 2 years. I thought it was great!! Than they took local channels away. I only have NBC. No!! CBS or ABC.  Also CNN is removed no big loss!! The problem is CBS  carries all our local NFL games. ..so before you sign up make you search it out . I bought an hd. Antenna for 45 bucks I get now 56 channels all my locals  . I have an fire stick and watch Pluto tv tubi ..for news!!
self direction,Still couldn't watch the game,Thought I was gaining access to NBA playoffs (Rockets vs Lakers - game 1) but found out that I needed to make additional purchase.  Don't see much here that I will be using.
self direction,"Easy, Straight Forward way to Cut the Cord","I did a lot of research before making the switch, this stream package had all the channels we watch and a fraction of the DirecTV monthly cost. Wife is happy that every TV works the same, still exploring the functions but it's always available... even in bad storms which makes my dogs happy. Recommending to all my friends."
self direction,Very expensive,"With all of the streaming services, I thought hey let me try Fubo.  First this is 65 dollars a month, I can view sports some other way."
self direction,Thought it was included,I downloaded the app because I thought it was included with Prime. I did not want to pay an additional fee so I did not use it
power,Great for soccer.,Navigation and recording a bit difficult with Firestick. Need better controls for changing viewing.
power,Make sure it gets the games you want,"Couldn't get it to English in the control panel. Did not get the Patriots pre season games, which is whole reason why I signed up!"
self direction,DoesnÃ¢??t play all games available,IÃ¢??m a Titans fan living in Bengals country. I wanted to watch my Titans and thought this would be the way to do that but when I tried to find the game the only one I could watch was the one playing on local channels.
power,It works,"Very nice to have, could use better software and more control of display."
self direction,Cost,I didn't get to use it The cost was way to much . I thought it was free with prime.
self direction,Try fubo,"Such a deal, I was paying 40$ for YouTube TV...now i'm only paying a fraction of that..thanks to my Amazon stick"
self direction,So so,I thought it would have more of a selection of sports.
self direction,Uninstalled,"Sorry, I thought it was free like Pluto, so I did not pursue"
self direction,No Monday night football,I didn't get the program I thought they carried.
self direction,No fubo tv,Cant write a review.  I don't get fubo tv. I thought it was free. Apparently it's not.
self direction,"What the overview is , isn't what you can receive.","I mistakenly thought with fubo I could watch NBCSP and MSG. in AZ.  but apparently its for local markets (Philly, NY) I was hoping to watch the Flyers and Rangers, Islanders games. will probably just keep my Hulu."
self direction,Sports,I thought I would be able to watch out of market sports programs but can not.I think it is a good value and I will purchase it once I set all my TV's to use it.  It will save me almost $60/mo over what I pay for direct tv.
self direction,Good but,Thought this was for American football
self direction,Excellent to watch soccer games,The main reason why I got this app is to watch the EPL. The bonus it does have movie selection from family to action and tv shows which I haven't messed a lot with.
security,Did not stream,The app delayed on an episode of a show and then a message popped to say that the device was not compatible even though it allowed me to sign up online with asecurity code.
self direction,Pretty dissatisfied!,"I thought I would get more spanish channels with my latino subscription but Univision was the only good one, plus prices after free trial are just as high as cable"
self direction,Enjoying TV without all the wasted money!,Wish I could just go channel to channel but canÃ¢??t with Firestick. Miss movie channels. Still exploring all the features.
self direction,Everything we love fraction of the cost,All the channels we love for a fraction of the cost. Also included cloud dvr!
security,free trial did not work,when it did not work tyler 9475 tried to sell me virus protection.do not trust after this.
self direction,Never able to complete the registration,Registration website was broken.  Never able to complete the transaction.  Never received what we wanted.
self direction,One Star,"Not interested, thought it offered more."
self direction,Excellent,Fubo TV was everything I was looking for at a fraction of the cost.
self direction,Disappointed,Wasn't what I thought it would be.
self direction,WATCHING FOOTBALL,"THE APP IS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS, THAT I WHY i CANCELED."
self direction,Not worth the money,ItÃ¢??s slow and doesnÃ¢??t offer as many channels as I originally thought. IÃ¢??m cancelling after my free week trial. IÃ¢??ll jusr stick with Hulu to live stream
self direction,Not a trial,I thought I was signing up for a week trial and they charged me for 2 months.
self direction,Unstable,"Heavy delays and stoppages. Thought it was internet, but was channel specific on Fubo."
self direction,It's not free,I deleted the app. I thought it was free.
power,No parental controls,The price is great here t there are no parental controls for the premium channel
self direction,?,Thought it would be better than DIRECTV NOW. ItÃ¢??s a little better for sports but doesnÃ¢??t cover other networks that we like.
self direction,Channels,Not all the channels I thought
self direction,"So much better since the Jan 2017 update! Works great now, but would still like SAP audio capability.","I was using the FuboTV app on my FireTV stick, and it was working terribly...pausing often to buffer, lousy video quality, terrible user interface with non-intuitive controls and fast forward/back scrubbing that would only jump in 9 minute increments.  I was about to give up on the FuboTV service, but then they upgraded the application earlier this month (Jan 2017), and what an incredible difference it has made!  Since the upgrade, the video quality has been consistently good (both live viewing and recorded matches), and it has not had to pause to buffer video even once.  The user interface is much better now, with high-speed scrubbing when you hold down the fast forward/back button.  Good stuff!  Thank you to FuboTV for fixing this app!!!  Now I can cheer on Barca without technical distractions!  Just one remaining issue...I can't seem to turn on the SAP alternate audio...this would be helpful for the matches that are broadcast with Spanish commentary."
self direction,Another game/event with a charge $ attached!!,Disappointed -thought it was included in Amazon Prime...tired of paying for access :(
self direction,Doesnt work on phone.,Doesn't work on phone. I travel on the weekends. Thought i would be able to watch football on my phone.
self direction,Meh,Wasn't what i thought it was going to be
security,It's a great idea but it seems to need some work on ...,"It's a great idea but it seems to need some work on stability.  I couldn't watch some futbol matches that were on my list of channels.  Also the DVR option only lets you record one match at a time.  I feel for the price of the subscription, this should be increased.  Overall, I love the idea of the app, but I am not satisfied with the quality.  They may patch it to fix these issues I have with it one day."
self direction,Free trials are the new way to scam people.,Free trials are the new way to scam people. They purposely make it confusing and provide little record on your account actions whether you cancelled or not
self direction,Commercial,I thought there were to many commercials. They play three different ones 3 or 4 times in a row.
self direction,Free download but not free service,I thought it was free but its a pay for service
self direction,"If I could give this zero stars, I would.","My husband subscribed to watch Racing: motorcycle, F1, etc.  We are both very tech savvy, but he found this interface to be very difficult to navigate.  We called to cancel, and were charged for 2 months. We realized this error when we got an Ã¢??insufficient fundÃ¢?Â notice from our CC company while trying to pay a bill. FUBO snuck through a $60 charge and caused us to be short of our payment by $20. Massive chain reaction of bullshit has been following us ever since... and, weÃ¢??re on vacation trying to deal with all this. Not to mention the fact that all our money is in limbo, again, while on vacation.FUBO customer service is a joke. Everyone was 100% unhelpful. Took 3 reps to get a supervisor who reluctantly refunded one month.I highly recommend everyone avoids FUBO like the plague, and goes to watch live sporting events in a bar, like an adult."
self direction,PLEASE if you think you canceled read this,"I won't post my entire experience however there is a detailed review on both trustpilot and the BBB.  The most important thing from my experience to be careful about:1,  Don't let them put you in a loop towards the end of your trial .  I canceled after 1 hour and still was put into that loop where you will get replies to emails where the goal may be to run out the clock on the 7 days.2.  VERY IMPORTANT - They will tell you that you have to cancel through the app, and that was easy enough to do. but thank god I didn't hit yes , i confirm I want to cancel, and look away from the screen as it went back to their home page.  A statement that really blended in with everything else and was only on for a second or two said that my cancellation was not successful.  This is where I knew it was a scam.  It should have given me an error when I hit that confirm button and not let me cancel or I should have gotten and email generated by the system stating that my cancellation was not successful and to please contact customer service.  Of course neither thing happened.  I can only imagine how many people have hit that button and looked away, went to a different tab quickly, or just didn't notice the hard to notice or because it was so fast thought it said that their cancellation was, instead was not, successful.If you are reading this before signing up with these people, unlike me, Don't!  Run and don't look back.And if you know you canceled through the app within the 7 days and still got billed, you are not crazy rather you were scammed.If you do cancel through customer service ask for a confirmation email and if you don't have one within 15 minutes call back.  I received my almost immediately.Hope this helps someone either get the money they were scammed back or prevents someone getting taken in the first place."
tradition,Pointless - The content is available elsewhere. Sometimes for free.,"It seems Fubo has missed the point of the  cord-cutting ""targeted streaming content service"" trend. Or, at least, they want you to think it's cord cutting. Unlike NFL, NBA and MLB apps that offer the user the ability to focus on just the content they are after (baseball, hockey, US football), Fubo delivers packages of fairly low bandwidth sports streams that force you to channel surf in order to find the content you're looking for. (Let's face it, there are hundreds, if not thousands of football matches going on around the world all year long),The truth is, when you're forced to buy bundled packages that resemble what you are already paying for with traditional ""cable tv"", you've just exchanged one cord for another. For most people, internet and standard cabe tv use the same physical wire to the house. Using Fubo to stream the same channels means you are actually using a SLOWER (lower bandwidth & quality) stream to watch the same channels in lower quality. PLUS you are paying for the additional data/bandwidth usage that goes against your monthly allotment...- And before Fubo says ""but you can watch on computer or mobile device""; most cable providers already offer mobile apps or web access to live channels. Most major networks already offer mobile/web access to streaming content if you can prove you have a traditional cable tv contract. (NBC/ABC/FOX/SKY etc..) - So (MAYBE) Fubo has missed the point on cord cutting and targeted streaming, (MAYBE) Fubo knows but wants people to think it's a cable/cord killer service, or (MAYBE) Fubo is an initiative sponsored by a major cable company to rope former customers into a service that, at it's core, is exactly what people are trying to get away from or already paying for.NOTE to Fubo: The point of targeted steaming apps is to allow customers to pay for ONLY the channels they use. HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, Mhz, MLB,, Netflix, Amazon Prime all do this very well.. So if Fubo REALLY want to impress customers, they will figure out a way to corral all of the network relationships they've made into apps or options within their app that allow customers to purchase focused content like EPL, Europa League, Bundesliga League, specific team matches or cup competitions without the need to channel surf and slog through irrelevant content to find the content they're seeking. Otherwise, there's really no point. The content is available elsewhere. Sometimes for free."
power,3 Month Long  Redundant Running Commercials Spoil the FuboTV Experience,Have had FuboTV for 6mos and I have no issues other than a few hiccups on streaming occasional. What they need to fix is their commercial programming. I have contacted them about having to watch & listen to the Dr. Dre Beats headphone commercial at every commercial break since January. The song being played is very annoying and having to hear it every 5 - 10 min is noxious at best. Their tech support weiner replied back quickly but said they have no control over the commercial programming I call B.S. as I checked multiple channels and that obnoxious commercial is being run on all of them. The next new commercial just arrived from Chili's. I won't buy Beat headphones and I won't go to Chili's just because you drive your message at me every 10min.
stimulation,"Good content, just not for me...","After trialing FuboTV for a week I chose to cancel.  The sports content was very good (for international sports), and the content of movies and tv programs was pretty good.  My main complaints were: 1. while I could save or record movies soon to be aired on individual networks, I did not see a way to save those that were on demand, meaning that each time I wanted to watch an on demand movie I would need to do a new search through all movies.  Being able to save movies to a favorites list would have been a very good option.  2. TV programs I liked could be saved, or recorded.  There was then a list created of all of the programs I was following, which was great.  What wasnÃ¢??t great was that the list only displayed 20 shows or recordings, which means that after I spent my time going through everything offered on Fubo and saving or recording the content I was interested in, the majority of it was saved, but not searchable as only 20 items were kept in the list.  Very frustrating! Again, good content, but the delivery of that content and the difficulty in identifying something to watch was why I cancelled.Customer service: canceling within the trial period was a challenge, but eventually the monthly charge I incurred as a result of not being able to easily cancel was fully refunded, and I thank Fubo for that.  Unfortunately, it took way too much time, effort, aggravation, and unfortunate negative reviews to make that happen.  After getting the runaround for several days I was finally contacted by a woman who took care of the problem in a matter of seconds.  Had it been a strait forward process from the beginning, and if Fubo cleans up the customer service issues I experienced it would be a very good service for a lot of people, just not for me."
self direction,"If your tv/laptop are over 6 months old, don't order this!","I got fubo specifically to watch the World Series.  But after creating an account, profile, et al, I was finally able to find the game in the list of programs.  But when I click on it, the screen goes black and it gives me this message:""This Match is available in 4k.  But it looks like this device doesn't support 4k resolution.  Visit fubo.tv/4k for a list of supported devices and browsers.""OK, it's *available* in 4k, but can I watch it in whatever k my tv has?  Apparently not!  And not my laptop either!  My laptop is barely a year old and my tv is maybe a couple years old, and yet their technology is not enough to show fubo's ONLY way to show the game??  It feels insulting to tell me to go to their website to see what devices it works on.  Like I'm going to buy a new TV and laptop just to be able to watch this unreliable channel!  Instead of fubo finding a way to play on my device, they tell me to find a device that will play fubo.  Ridiculous."
self direction,Can be misleading to cancel; keep an eye on credit card charges,"I cancelled (or at least thought i did) my Fubo TV service and noticed that months later i'm still being charged.  Researching the internet this appears to be a problem with Fubo.  Once you click the cancel button on your account page, a survey page pops up and then you have to click 'confirm cancellation' or your service will not be cancelled.  I'm positive I performed this step the first time I cancelled because I had to go back into my account a week later to confirm exactly when our service would be discontinued.  Unfortunately, I don't have confirmation from FUBO that I cancelled.  I've cancelled again and this time taken a screenshot verifying when my service will end.  I still have not recieved an email from FUBO confirming my cancellation."
self direction,NO FAST FORWARDING ON YOUR RECORDINGS...STUPID!!!!!,Thought when I recorded event I could FF stuff I didn't want to watch. You CANNOT FF - so what's the point of recording??I will definitely CANCEL after my free trial period.  I don't want to watch all the French Open tennis matches I recorded. If I still had Cable-TV I would FF to the specific matches I want to see.Really stupid to have DVR recording option offered to customers when they have NO CONROL with their recordings!!!
self direction,Fubo stands for Financially Unstable Burglar Operation,"I had Fubo for maybe 6 or 7 months. It was buggy, the stream would get choppy or freeze regularly, and I didnÃ¢??t have ESPN. Oh well, I thought. $45 a month is still worth it. That is, until receiving an additional $26 charge for no apparent reason that they refused to refund me. That is stealing so I cancelled my subscription and itÃ¢??s doubtful that I will ever have any business with them ever again."
self direction,FuboTV is awful!,"We were looking for a way to watch some sports games and came across FuboTV so we thought we'd give the free trial a shot. This service is horrible. It stops working constantly, like every two minutes. We missed most big plays of the game we were watching. When it comes back it's blurry and pixely and will work correctly for a couple of minutes and then goes out again. After the free trial it's $25/month for the first month and then $40 after that but this service is not worth that price."
self direction,"Not worth it, deceptive",Signed up for the 7 day trial and cancelled after the 1st day. Something happened with the browser on my phone while cancelling. I thought it went through and they charged me two more times. Not worth it at all
universalism,No heads up and no appreciation!!!,I didn't get any heads up about the change in channels and charges until today when changes take place... I will be cancelling my service that wasn't all the great to begin with!!!! We don't get any appreciation!!!
self direction,It was way too expensive,Didn't get it way too much money my cable is cheaper and has more channels I thought it was free filled me
self direction,fubo tv,i thought it was free
self direction,Too many poorly-timed commercials,"This app is virtually useless. Primary detractions:1. Playback is unreliable in quality and seamlessness.  This is not a problem I have with other apps. Every 20 seconds or-so I get a yellow 'buffering' loop that takes 20 more seconds to return to streaming (now at substantially decreased quality). My internet speed is fine--and, oddly enough, provided by NBC's parent company.2. Commercials cut into programming. I got the app to watch the 2018 Olympics and it cuts into live competition to show ads. It might be tolerable (but shouldn't happen at all) if it was a rare fluke; but it isn't. It happens every couple minutes; absolutely ruining the watching experience.3. The commercial-to-program ratio is something like 2:1. I am spending twice as much time watching commercials as I am programming.I can only surmise that NBC really doesn't want one to actually use this to enjoy their programming."
power,"If you're getting errors read this!  Poorly deployed app, but they have the monopoly...","If you're getting an error when opening the app, or loading content, you can't have any ad blockers active.  Bypass your PIHole, remove ad blockers from computer, whatever. That fixes the problem.As for the app, it sucks. The ads are as every 1-star review describes, constant, unrelenting, and repetitive. Hockey games aren't so bad, but the Olympics were terrible.  Needing a subscription is expected, but a cable account is ridiculous. Just give a non-cable cutter friend or family a few bucks and use their account. The app is slow and sluggish. Just have to deal with that.  I would say use every means necessary to circumvent the traditional ""Pay us to watch, watch our advertising, and we'll black out what we want"" mentality of the networks. There are lots of options out there. The sooner everyone ditches the status quo and hits their pocketbooks, the sooner they'll revamp the pay structure to get customers back.Cancel Netflix."
power,Crappy stream quality on the firestick under the new app design.,"It did work great before NBCSN decided they wanted to push this gold sub package and new app version. Ever since I cant stream the content clearly using the firestick, constantly buffering and out of focus. Same content streams flawless on my pc and apple tv legacy (3rd gen). So its the app on the firestick that is the issue. I hope it gets fixed. Really disappointing app right now, makes streaming racing in my office or game room a non-starter. Its not my bandwidth with a 500 MB UL/DL connection and flawless 4k from Disney, Amazon Prime video, and Netflix. The video issues are all with the app that has been updated and pushed to the firestick. The firestick does many things well, but this app is not one of them. I dont know how much control they have over it but if I could roll back to the original version of the app I would.Just fix it."
security,Monopoly pricing. Mediocre product,"Purchased a Ã¢??sport passÃ¢?? for a competition only screened in the US by NBC SportsGold. With no alternative way of watching my choice was either purchase the pack or not watch the games. Pricing is outrageous for what is screened for free in every other country of the world. The live stream in the six nations rugby I was watching is good (as it comes from the U.K.) but abruptly stops at half time to be replaced by strange wind like noises around the empty stadium. To watch events like the the rugby World Cup in the US you have the choice as a consumer to not watch, or pay monopoly pricing.The APP is best started 10-15 minutes prior to kick off as thesecurity features are apt to have changed requiring swift log-ins on an actual computer (not a phone) to reauthorise what you have already paid for. This is consistent with the monopoly pricing - they donÃ¢??t want you sharing log-in details. But it also means itÃ¢??s tough to watch across multiple devices even when you have paid for the privilege."
self direction,TERRIBLE OLYMPIC COVERAGE 2018,"tthis has been the worst coverage of the Olympics ever!  I've been watching for 62 years and I should know.  I started taping the program about 25 years ago, and it used to be action packed.  It was all about the athletes and there sport and accomplishments.  Now they spend more time on themselves (the so called news readers)  I can't even call them journalists.  the show nothing but commercials (6-7) when they break.  And the segments that they do on each other is a joke.  How many times do I have to endure Johnny Weir and Tara discussing their frigging wardrobe.  I'm sorry but this is still a program that is ; or at least it used to be; seen by families with kids.  Don't you think they have some questions about Johnny wearing his lipstick nd rouge...not to mention the hair obsession.  You never know what your going to get when you tune to a NBS (SC) station.  I have yet to see one thing that is complete.  AND WHERE ARE THE MEDAL CEREMONIES????  Where is Bob Costas when you need him, and Mary.  The little skating lessons given by Scott Hamilton and Tahinan is just plain stupid.  If they continue this way I won't be watching again.  How sad!"
self direction,So far it's useless,"If you still have the NBC Gold app, keep it for awhile. For two weeks I've tried to watch a subscription *I paid for* and it wasn't available. I opened the ""old"" Gold app and there it was. And the old app remembered my so I didn't have to log in everytime. This one keeps making me authenticate. And as for authentication, how's this flow: scan a barcode, be taken to a website to enter a code, and what's that get you? A login screen. Why not just give me the login screen to begin with. And btw, that's not to say the Gold app was gold, it had plenty of issues, but I wanted to think they'd put some thought into a ""new"" app before asking customers to switch.Update: Edit to one star, this just gets worse and worse and they don't care."
self direction,Of Course You Need a Cable Subscription!,"No, I'm not being sarcastic.  Lots of people are confused because this app has NBC in the name, so please allow me to clarify.  The NBC Sports app is the streaming app for the NBC-owned cable sports channels like NBCSN, Golf Channel, etc.  It's no different than other apps for cable sports channels like ESPN.  Generally speaking, the only ""free"" sports you will find on network TV anymore are NFL games.  In my area (St. Paul), the local MLB, NBA, and NHL teams are all broadcast on regional sports networks (RSNs), which are only available through a cable TV package.  Every now and then you might find a Sunday matinee on network TV for the Wild (NBC) or T-Wolves (ABC), but 99% of the time it's on cable.  So yes, you need to have a subscription to stream it.The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because the frame rate is only 30 fps.  Sports are generally broadcast in 60 fps for better picture quality during fast action.  ESPN and Fox Sports both offer 60 fps, but NBC Sports is still only 30 fps.  What gives, NBC?  It's 2019!  Get your act together!"
power,"Spoiler headings should be eliminated altogether like ""Zlatan puts United ahead","Needs work. You can't fast forward or rewind streams using. When you try to fast forward, the app isn't recognizing the the button pressess on the remote. The app just starts blinking. Often it doesn't recognize the remote control at all. I use mostly for EPL replays, one, the location of highlights means you have to avert your eyes for spoilers. The titles are often spoilers. Replays should be a the top. Spoiler headings should be eliminated altogether like ""Zlatan puts United ahead."" Just title it ""X v. Y highlights""  The exact same thing plagued the app during the olympics. Not that i care about olympics as this is about the app when it isn't Olympic mode. Sometimes a soccer game will resume where you left off sometimes it doesn't. There is no discernible pattern.A huge problem is often EPL soccer matches are not added to the app in a timely fashion. The game can end and it can be a day or two before it's available. Forcing you to illegal means to get the game shortly after it ends. Worse you can often log on on the phone and see that the game is actually listed for streaming.Note: I have the app on Roku too and it has the exact same issue as the layout is almost identical.Understand this:1. The app is requires you have a cable subscription. It is NOT a substitute cable service. It's not free.2. This is for the NBC Sports Channel (a cable teir sports channel) NOT broadcast NBC channel (the basic channel)"
power,Terrible functionality. I would rather watch a less than legal stream,"This app is terrible. I cannot find any way to turn on closed captioning. The playback controls are basically worthless. While watching the NHL West Final, I paused the game and intended to fast forward during the commercial break to catch up. Turns out it is impossible to rewind or fast forward. Ended up missing two goals when we went back to the live game."
stimulation,Not very impressed.,"Had a challenge downloading to the IPAD. When I was on the phone with support they walked me thru the process. (Thank you!) I asked about compatibility with TIVO and was told ""sure...no problem"" I was later informed by TIVO, nope and probably not going to happen. I was watching the President's Cup Golf Match. With about 2 hours remaining in the event and the match all tied...They ended the broadcast. WHAT IS THE POINT. I had to wait 12 hours after the event to watch it on NBC Network.  One last comment, if this is live streaming...why so many commercials? I honestly think there were fewer on the network airing."
self direction,NBC Sports Does Not Make the Podium.,"We purchased NBC Sports so we could watch the Olympics.  There are only about 2 weeks of this special event and then another 4 years wait till the next set of Winter Olympics.  We wanted to indulged! Since NBC owns the broadcasting rights to the Olympics, this seemed like a smart, simple purchase.  We quickly learned this was neither smart or simple.  'Error' resulted in missing what was supposed to be ice skating when the programming froze for more than 20 minutes.  Morning televised programs are aired again later in the day.  (102 events people!!! Why replay the SAME ones?!?!). And in some random competition with itself, NBC will show one event on NBC Sports and a completely different event on NBC...So, I can watch what I paid for or watch what is free through my TV antennae.  ???  There 92 nations competing in 102 events, and preliminaries to some of those events, and semifinals for some of those events...It thought I would be able to see all of the Olympics with this purchase.  Clearly, I was mistaken."
power,Appears well-conceived but orphaned for maintenance/development.,"Frustrating site.  I watch live F1 and IndyCar when I can.  I try to watch Full Event Replays if I miss the live.  The site controls are balky.  Sort by sport 1) doesn't always work, 2) doesn't stick through struggles to find the event.  If play can be successfully accomplished, the stream is generally smooth (Occasionally hangs for buffering, and I'm cable hardwired!) and the picture quality is good once the stream is established.  It can be awkward but it's the best that formula motorsport fans have got.  For that we're appreciative.  Perhaps more awareness that followers are more likely to employ their PC or smart TV rather than a phone and seek out the replay to watch the process rather than simply the result, would lead to improved/better optimized site for such consumption."
stimulation,OK for now; navigation/streaming quality could be better. Activation problem browser related.,"I downloaded for Olympics coverage on my Fire TV Stick. Live events are easily found, but locating link to completed events can be a challenge because you have to scroll through as many as 300 events/highlights (so far) to find the one you want to seeÃ¢??there is no search tool. Quality of streaming is not outstanding, but most full events as well as excerpts of interviews and short features seem to be available if you look long/hard enough.As a side note, I initially had difficulty activating the app on my PC; clicking the ""activate"" link in my browser failed to go to my carrier's website, which was required for final activation. However, that seemed to be a browser issue. When I switched to another browser with extensions not loaded, activation went smoothly."
self direction,I onlywatch motor sports on this channel and am tired of ...,"I only watch motor sports on this channel and am tired of the excessive ads and the poor graphics.  They continuously put advertising on the ""ticker tape"" standings bar and then start the ticker tape over again and you can't see what is going on in the back of the pack.  The commentators are incapable of tracking back markers that make significant progress during the race and only focus on the top 5 or so performers.  During the recent Bristol races the ads ran so long you missed significant parts of the race.  With all their camera coverage, they frequently can't adequately show incidents on the track.Also, they don't allow enough time for an event and change channels without any notification making it almost impossible to DVR anything.  I thought Fox Sports was bad, but NBC Sports is really terrible coverage and their arbitrarily changing channels is a huge hassle."
tradition,"Great content, poor app. Very frustrating.","Unfortunately all of the sports that NBC has purchased are trapped behind this incredibly frustrating app. IÃ¢??ve used it for years now, and I would guess IÃ¢??ve been asked to authorize the app more than 50 times. Netflix, Hulu, heck even crackle arenÃ¢??t constantly prompting for logins.Browsing a program is also difficult. Of course I donÃ¢??t expect to fast forward through commercials, but seeking a point in a replay is done by skipping ahead 10 seconds at a time. It does feature a seek function by pausing and fast forwarding, but that doesnÃ¢??t work.If it worked as designed it would be outstanding, but as seems to be the theme with the traditional networks, it doesnÃ¢??t. IÃ¢??m excited for the day Netflix picks up the Premier League and Amazon the NFL."
self direction,Great..,"Great...watched the entire Super Bowl on my Firestick without one second of ""buffering"" no skips, no delays and in HD. I've noticed a lot of negative reviews. There was mention of staring at the screen with a logo and the words something along the lines of ""we'll be back in a moment"". The first time it happened I thought that it was buffering; so not to miss anything I switched to cable TV and the game was not being played at that particular moment anyway. Those of you who have submitted negative reviews for this App should look for a problem with your setup, Not the App..... because as the old Chinese saying goes ""sum ting wong"""
self direction,Excellent app for soccer streaming.,"This is an excellent app that I use on my Fire TV stick.  It streams all sorts of great action like Soccer and other sports.  The fact that it's legit and free are such a great combo.  The streaming is flawless so there's no buffering or anything.  The quality is outstanding as well.I was originally disappointed when English Premier League soccer went off Fox.  But I'm finding the NBC broadcasts to be just as good if not better.If you're a soccer fan like I am, get this app.  You won't be sorry."
tradition,I've rated this app poorly mostly due to terrible streaming performance,"I've rated this app poorly mostly due to terrible streaming performance. How I came to use this app and my experience is as follows: I recently gave traditional cable the boot and have been using PlayStation VUE for TV service. The most recent NASCAR race was not available on the NBCSN channel but was available through this app. I was curious how well this app would work for a live sporting event and decided to give it a shot. I searched for the app via Fire TV's universal search and was able to find it with ease. Upon installation you have to go through an activation process that requires you to prove you have a cable, or similar, provider; this is not unlike many other pay tv channel applications. Once I completed activation, via a computer, the app was instantly accessible. The interface is sparse yet straightforward and I was able to quickly find the race and stream it. Unfortunately, it would stream for about 5 minutes then pause and show a buffering icon, there was no way to get the content to continue streaming without restarting. Upon restart everything worked properly again... ...for about five minutes and then everything froze. I repeated this process four times with the same result. My Fire TV's WiFi signal is listed as, ""very good,"" and other streaming services I use (Netflix, PlayStation VUE) worked fine. I was excited to give this application a try, but don't see it as a viable option for watching live content at this point.  I plan to test it again at some point and see if the experience changes."
self direction,It doesn't have very many options for live sports.,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01923M8T6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_31I like being able to have the sports news, but I wish there was more options on watching live sporting events.  When I purchased this app I thought there were more live options than the highlight reels."
stimulation,Don't Waste Your Time and Energy!!,"This reviews deserves ZERO stars, but I think I must post at least one!!This has been a HUGE disappointment!! We went through our Dish connection -- which took two days and many trials.The coup de grace was last night... We were trying to replay/watch the mens' figure skating final.  The transmission would go from high def to low web and back again.But the best part was when we got to about the 2 hour appoint of the 4.5 hour program! The transmission would suddenly show ""end of program""!! So we had to start from the beginning, fast forward to the point where we were, watch more (typically 5 - 10 min), the program would ""end"" again, and ou little game would start over! After 20 - 30 trials of this my wife and I gave up on NBC. That's it for us and this winter Olympics!Oh! And I am sure someone will say we have a bad internet connection, right? Well, we tried this over at least three separate connections over several days, so our adventures last night were not unique!"
tradition,"Activates with PlayStation Vue, even in markets without live NBC access.","This app gets 5 stars from me as it supports activation with a PlayStation Vue account. Typically services like these ONLY support traditional cable/satellite TV services, so being able to activate with PSVue is great for cord-cutters like us.This is especially useful as in our area, PS Vue does not have live NBC streaming yet, only NBC On Demand, so we can not yet watch live NBC broadcast sports through PS Vue. But since the NBC Sports app still supports our activation, and during the Olympics, that has been a life saver."

I wanted to watch the men's  hockey match and ended up with Japanese girls playing curling, really? Not exactly what I was interested in."
self direction,Unhappy,"I thought I would be able to get this using my Fire Stick and my HD antenna. Unfortunately it does not.

stimulation,This was a disservice to pro Motocross and Supercross.,"This was one of the weakest strems I've paid for. Usability was a challenge. When it stopped showing the main competition, it went to still shots and it was hard to know where things were in the competition next. There was only background sound. The interface was very large on the best of equipment, even with commercial internet from my business. When Supercross went to NBC with this program it lost a lot of viewers and I understand why."

What is this some kind of dumb protest by NBC against people who choose to stream their entertainment? What does it matter if I watch commercials via traditional means or streaming over the internet? We got to watch a whopping 10 minutes of Olympic events and 20 minutes of commercials when it was working before it prompted us to activate and provide our internet provider details. NBC, why do you care how I internet?!"
self direction,"Dissatisfied, not doing aggain.","I wanted to watch curling.  It was 50/50 with curling and commercials.  I expected a better break on the sports action, but was dissatisfied.

security,Great picture quality - Very very poor app stability,"The NBC Sports for FIRETV app stability could be improved by a lot. Although the video quality is amazing, the stream often drops and almost every time after an ad, the app just crashes an goes back to the beginning of video out of nowhere.

Very spotty quantity of videos, some have absolutely no commentary and the graphics are impenetrable. Fast forward doesn't work, so you can't skip to the action on replays. And the commercials pop up at random intervals, sometimes within 20 sec of the last. Generally this is a very poor experience, and entirely unacceptable way to explore sports with which you aren't familiar."

I was absolutely disappointed to find that out when my NBC Sports app showed 9 minutes left in the game when I received my ESPN update.
self direction,I thought I was going to see replay of The ...,"I thought I was going to see replay of The Tour de France, any time after it was transmitted live, so it has not made a difference,it appears I can not stream it at any time after it was live."
self direction,Highlights only,"Only able to watch highlights.  Wanted cable access to watch competitions.  Being an app on Fire, I thought it would allow me to watch live or at the least recorded competitions."
self direction,Thought I was going to have a lot of options ...,Thought I was going to have a lot of options by downloading this but unfortunately you only get it for 25 minutes and have to constantly put in a code. So I will not be using that app. Nobody likes to have to do that every 25 minutes just to watch something
self direction,Almost good,I thought I was buying an app/service that would allow me to watch golf tournaments.  This app doesnt allow you to see all days of the tournaments. In some case you can only see select holes.  This means that you wonÃ¢??t be following the tournament leaders.
self direction,The app has severe control latency issues. It ignores ...,The app has severe control latency issues.  It ignores the command of the remote completely.  Very much unlike my apple TV operation with the same application.  Probably a Fire TV interaction with the app issue since the app is trying to force me to watch an add before every selection I make. During the add the remote is effectively dead.

self direction,It's only a trial version!!!,"Downloaded this to my Fire, didnt know it was only a trial, shut me off right when my friend was participating in the Olympics  so I missed his whole run!!!!  Thought I  had it covered, not very happy let me tell you!!!"
self direction,What I liked most was the thought of watching the Olympics,"What I liked most was the thought of watching the Olympics. What I liked least was I couldn't just stream them over my wifi, so I was not able to."
self direction,But was highly disappointed they want cable provider when I just wanted what ...,I thought this was a free app. But was highly disappointed they want cable provider when I just wanted what would be publically broadcasted. I wouldn't recommend  app. SorryÃ°??? thumbs down for me!
self direction,Complete junk!,This app is complete junk. I downloaded it so I could watch the Olympics and all I get is auth errors and it won't allow me to access any of videos. I am really upset that I thought this would be a quality product and it was a waste of time.

self direction,Saw the advertisement for Olympics on FireTV and thought I'd ...,Saw the advertisement for Olympics on FireTV and thought I'd try.  This was nothing but pure commercials with just a few minutes of events.  Shut it off after 5 minutes and don't plan to use it again.
self direction,No football game,I thought I would be able to watch Monday and Thursday night football. All I get is people talking about the games. DonÃ¢??t like it at all
self direction,This app is pretty eh.,"This app is pretty mediocre. The commercials cut in randomly and interrupt the event right in the middle of the action, even on replay. You also can't rewind which is very annoying."
power,Spent an hour and a half with Amazon Fire TV tech support-they are amazing!!,Shame on NBC....Prematurely launched this app.My husband was set to watch The British Open...but many streams are blocked by Parental Control messages. (We have NO controls set up). Spent an hour and a half with Amazon Fire TV tech support-they are amazing!!!!!!  But still unable to watch live streams.Very disappointing.
self direction,Five Stars,I thought everything was good. Very easy to access and a great picture.
self direction,Watching my Chicago Blackhawks,I could not watch it because my provider has blacked it out under my subscription. I thought I would be able to use this under my subscription with Amazon?
self direction,One Star,Not what I thought it would be.
self direction,Very very glitchy,"App is incredibly glitchy. Watching live games is completely unreliable as it will constantly cut back to scenes that occurred about 10 seconds ago, and then jump right back to the live action. NBC really needs to update this app."
self direction,Thought the app was free with Amazon Fire.. ...,Thought the app was free with Amazon Fire.... turns out you have to have an internet provider to continue to use it after a brief sampling. :-(
self direction,No full coverage,I thought I was going to be able to watch the Olympic coverage all you were able to watch for highlights what a bummer
self direction,Five Stars,Didn't watch as much as we thought we would.
universalism,MISLEADING,It was my understanding that the service was free but it was only free for a limited time.
self direction,Going downhill fast,This WAS a great app.Not they make you pay extra for game that were free just 2 months ago.Dumb to have to switch between 2 apps to watch different games. Poorly thought out
self direction,Not what I thought it would be wanted nbc sports ...,Not what I thought it would be wanted nbc sports net . So this rating really should not count
self direction,Downloaded it to watch the Olympics and was very excited ...,Downloaded it to watch the Olympics and was very excited. THEN it tells me to activate with my TV provider. YOU are my TV provider. Why would I watch it on the fire stick and not on regular tv?????? Very poorly thought out.
self direction,Unusable Interface,Horrible user interface.  Who thought scrolling through 300 videos with no filter or sorting was a good idea?!
self direction,Disappointing,I thought it had tactical camera selection in watching games so IÃ¢??ll be canceling the following month
self direction,Unfortunate,I was using this app on my phone and computer and could watch everything in the app. So I thought this one would work the same. Even after going through the code entry to sync with my U-Verse account I can't watch anything but short highlights. Very deceiving and a bummer.
self direction,One Star,Very hard to get around and navigate- missed a lot of action trying to use features

self direction,"I thought I could watch ANY Olympic event, but ...","I thought I could watch ANY Olympic event, but every event I chose said No Authorization. I do not understand. It said live streaming. I am extremely upset this app will not as promised."
self direction,Two Stars,didn't give me what I thought it would.
self direction,Five Stars,Didn't use this as much as I thought I would.  But worked fine
self direction,Not really a live sport stream,Wasn't what I thought I was paying for. Not able to watch live TV sports.
self direction,Requires Cable Subscription,Thought I could watch the Olympics without cable using the app but NBC requires a cable subscription. If I had a cable subscription I would just watch it through my cable provider instead of downloading this app.
self direction,Love it,"Love it and wished I'd heard about it earlier. There is more to watch than I even thought about with the free apps. My grandson loves the free game apps and kid stuff, and I'm no longer paying $150 a month for paid programming and 20 year old movies I've already seen 5 times. I attached a flat antenna to my tv and now I can also get local channels. Perfect!"

self direction,One Star,Not what I thought it was!
self direction,Cannot watch Golf Channel on this,"I thought I could watch golf Channel on this, but only selected golf events"
self direction,Two Stars,I thought LIVE meant LIVE.  So far all I have seen is prerecorded sports.

self direction,Not what I thought....,This didn't do what I thought it would and I uninstalled it about 3 hours after I purchased it.  Merp!
self direction,Did not work,I am unhappy with this as I was charged today. I thought there was no charge and it was on 0.00 at the time.
self direction,I have no reasonable input,"My daughter downloaded this.. I have had zero interactions with it, other than writing this review, which I felt compelled to write."
self direction,Not worth it,This product is not what I expected. I thought it would work like cast but it does not
self direction,If it cost anything,No what i thought it was!
self direction,"It really isn't ""free."" Very misleading!","I thought I was downloading a free app, but after it searched and found garbage, it didn't do anything except direct me buy the cleaner to clean it up. So it was totally misleading in the first place by having ""Trash Cleaner"" in its name.I tried to buy the cleaner anyway ( about $3.49), but wasn't able to do so.So I uninstalled the whole thing from my device and cloud, and got something else."
security,Excellent app,"Occasionally I have had an uncomfortable feeling regarding the safety of a website, especially when I try to backout, and my command is ignored. I immediately close my kindle, reopen, go directly to this cleaning app to clean out the garbage. This app came recommended for my Kindle, it has never disappointed me."
self direction,Tracy D.,"This app finds junk left behind by two other popular cleaning apps. My Kindle seems faster already. Thanks for the fresh start.I didn't realize home much unnecessary trash I had stored. I thought the other cleaning apps where cleaning p,protecting and maintaining my Kindle as promised. That was definitely not the case"
self direction,Bait n' Switch!,"Scam. I thought this was another app (which I had used before) so I didn't bother looking at reviews. What a mistake. This is a bait & switch advertisement. It does nothing of benefit (for the device user, anyway)."
self direction,"ZERO Stars, false advertising","Ran it and found 3.3GB of garbage, had to buy it to remove, I bought it then had it clean and remove, it rrenoves 0.03GB of garbage. Asmall, fraction of what it claimed it could clean."
security,Excellent and fast acting,This app reduces wasted time organizing and setting up the cleaning process. It's easy and uncomplicated to run. This is the best app for cleaning and securing the safety of your tablet.
power,Cleaner and fast,This was thorough and fast. I'd tried other programs that didn't clean as much or as quickly. I use it at least once a month to keep the clutter under control.
power,Seems to consistently RID MY Kindle of trash,"This app cleans trash from my kindleHowever I don't really perceive any change in downloading.  The Wi-Fi connection is a greater influence, I believe."
security,Works like a charm,It's a great app. Runs faster than most others.  Got my Kindle to brand new like speeds.  It is a great adjunct to my othersecurity apps I have running.
power,"Very helpful, my Kindle is much faster.",My Kindle Fire was so slow. I reset it to factory status and it was still slower than it should be. I then downloaded this app and used it. It helped so much!
self direction,Very sneaky,"It scans your device and after scanning shows ,? Would you like to down load cleaner,I thought I just did ,then it tells you ,you have to pay for itNot free"
self direction,A waste of time.,"When I downloaded this free app, I thought it would do what it is called. Apparently it just locates files and malware that needs removed. Then you have to add a second app to remove said files. That app you have to buy. Thanks for nothing."
stimulation,It's quick and easy,Not sure what it d o esp as I ran it 3 times and got the same amt of MB removed. If it work it's quick and easy for tech challenged.
self direction,Wonderful product!,One of my kindle was running slow and programs were stopping all the time so I bought another one because I thought it was getting old. I have had it for a couple of years. When I got the next one I was just checking into different apps and saw this one to clean up my kindle. I bought it and it works great on both my kindle! The older one works like it's new! Thanks!
self direction,Noticeable Improvement in Speed of Operation.,"14 Viruses and 600 Megabytes of trash found the first time I ran the app a few days ago.  Just previous to starting this review the app reported 7 viruses and over 700 Megabytes of trash files.  I've noticed an improvement in load times for the sites I visit while surfing the net.  Predominantly this consists of my Yahoo and Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest  & Tumbler accounts (this is the first time I've listed all my social interaction accounts together; how did I get so many?) and company websites that are reported in the technology and science newsletters I subscribe to.  I'm frankly surprised by the number of viruses that are showing up, as I do not regard any of these sites as high risk--such as the many porn sites on the net.I'm less concerned with what is being removed from my Kindle than others who've posted reviews than I am in making sure my Kindle is secure from damaging malware, but I agree that it would be helpful to have a more detailed report of what the app has found and proposes to delete, before said deletion.  However, I have not yet found anything that I wanted to keep missing, so I'm quite happy with the app."
security,Never found anything and always wanted me to buy their service,Advertised as a free app .. then after initial scan they wanted to sell me the product even though it found no threats.If it can't find threats .. why buy it ?security tool for Fire (Securza) found problems and corrected them for free when this optimizer missed them .
self direction,Awsome,My tablet got agonizingly slow.I thought it as my internet connection.Iran the optimized and saw a significant improvement
security,Easy to use,"Uploaded in a snap.  Scans run quickly.  I cannot really tell whether this cleans EVERY virus , but it adds a level of security that I'm at least doing something right by cleaning garbage and viruses."
self direction,It does work !,Really speeds up reaction time of my fire.
self direction,Great seller!,Super easy transaction. Would highly recommend! Great game!
security,So quick and thorough!,I was astonished at the strength of the cleaning system and pleased with the rapid scan!  It brings  sense of totalsecurity!
security,Clutter has met it's match,clutter kills speed and stability...this app helps clear the clutter
security,Not what you expect,"Does exactly what they say ,but it only  tells you what it found, period. To get it to get rid of it found you must in app, buy the rest of the app to make it work. That is pretty  much false advertising as far as I am concerned. It is a very effective app once you get it all, and does a good job. It said it found 7virus files and i have three security programs that I run daily that never found any virus risks. That is the only reason I bought it."
self direction,"Seems effective, but no obvious log or report to check","I'm running this on an older Fire HD 8.9. Seems effective, maybe? There is no obvious report or logs of viruses or trash files. After allowing the app to run its scan,you have to just blindly trust the app/developers and allow the actions to run without opportunity for review."
self direction,This must be great for free,"Downloaded the app and it found 2 viruses in 2 or 3 seconds.  I thought WOW.  This must be great for free.  Then it asked me to purchase.  Amazon please review before offering to clients.  Oops, we have a problem."
self direction,Kindle Needed This,"My kindle which is a few years old started slowing down and even giving me the dreaded ""blue screen"" when browsing the internet . I thought I'd have to retire it but after using this app, no more blue screens and is running much faster. Very happy so far"
self direction,Wonderful,"I never thought that I had viruses on my kindle, nice to have a means to check"
self direction,Easy Breezy to use,Easy to use and provides clear easy to understand descriptions of what actions were taken.
self direction,quick,Does more than I expected.Much quicker than I thought it would be
self direction,Huh  maybe one star?,"Bought Ã¢??Tablet Optimizer & CleanerÃ¢?Â recently for myAmazon Kindle Fire HDX 8.9"" Received pm 8/11/14In Kindle HDX 8.9  I thought the battery was dead 11/5/15Initially it claimed I had 9 virusÃ¢?? and 880 junk files,  Today my machine locked up again while I was reading and would not let me reopen a book.So I ran the programÃ¢?Â¦.

For Ã‚Â½ hour and same problemDonÃ¢??t know what Tablet Optimizer & Cleaner  actually did but canÃ¢??t say it helpedNow claims all Ã¢??bad files removedÃ¢?Â  but my books wonÃ¢??t reopen.  Junk?"
security,Great price for protection,This has given me a real sense ofsecurity for protecting my Kindle Fire.
power,Useless as sold,Immediate goes to higher status purchase. Plus did nothing after initiated scan. Useless and waste of space!
security,Does the job.,"Does the job, but only after you pay a one time fee.  Fee is reasonable but its like the TV commercial where thesecurity guard is only a crime monitor.  I didn't need a free app to tell me I've trash and viruses...what's the point?"
self direction,DID NOT INSTALL.,I thought this was a free apt.
self direction,Very good,This works.  Very pleased with actions and it actually does as described.
security,Yessssss,Finally a cleaner that will work and not stall.  I have confidence that this part 2 of mysecurity is worth it!
stimulation,Fast and Easy,"It works and for a technically challenged person, that's all I need!"
self direction,It's OK for now,"I bought the app,  I thought the free version wasn't as good. It does the job and speeds my tablet up when it slows. Do I think it's the best? No but I am a not a computer wiz so it works for me for now."
power,Fast Clean-up,"I downloaded this and purchased the app cleaner. Was a little pricey but well worth the one time cost. As soon as I hit the ""clean garbage"" button it had my kindle fire back to ""like new"" status. Was lagging and getting stuck on pages in browser. After clean up it only took seconds to get back to normal."
power,Easy and quick,This is an easy quick way to check on the status of my tablet daily.  I really enjoy using it.
stimulation,Trash cleaner,Great for someone like me who is technically challenged!
self direction,Five Stars,"There really wasnt anything I disliked.I thought everything was good,worked well."
self direction,Not free optimizer,"Thought this would sork, but it forces you to purchase the product!"
security,Handy App.,"Every computer, even a Kindle needs protection."
power,Much needed app,"Fast scan and cleaner, glad I bought because it found a couple viruses my previous app did not.  Only 4 because it could use a few more user directions and navigation plus communication on status and last scanned."
self direction,Absolutely Amazing!!!,"How does a Factory Default Reset Kindle Fire 8"" HD tablet have viruses?  I don't know how either!  All I know is I have been working with Kindle support for 2 months trying to fix it.  We had tried everything.  Finally, we thought we had found then problem.  It was the SD Card.  They had me remove it and they replaced it for free.  My tablet worked fine after that and I couldn't be happier.  It worked for a total of 11 hours and then the problem returned.  THANK GOD I WAS TOLD ABOUT THIS APP TODAY!!!  I decided to try something so I did a Factory Default Reset, downloaded this app, and ran it.  It took no time at all and this app found 3 viruses and fixed them."
security,good app,This is a pretty reasonable price for protection of my Kindle. It works fast.
self direction,Worked okay,Thought I got scammed at first but this app cleaned my fire and sped it up
security,Does nothing to repair damage or even remove virus. Just lets you know it is there.,"Worthless, it searches out, but does not get rid of viruses. All this app does is bait someone into buying virus protection."
stimulation,Easy peasy!,"It does what it says, as easily as it says, I'm pleased and as I am somewhat technology challenged easy but effective is good."
self direction,Scans but then says download cleaner.,I thought that was what I did when I installed this app. You have failed this user goodbye.
self direction,An Endless Disappointing Loop,"I bought the app after reading some of the reviews and thought it would at least be decent, but it's just a downloaded endless loop of disappointment. The app started up right away, everything was clean quick and right to the point, so of course at first I loved it. Then I went and did the scan on my tablet, and again it was wicked fast and claimed to have found 6 viruses & a few junk files. I think awesome! then I see the button that says ""Download Cleaner"". So now I'm a little frustrated that I have to go and download ANOTHER app when the name clearly says Optimizer AND &&& Cleaner.So I brush it off and go ahead to download the cleaner except there's no free version of the cleaner. You can look at other people's great reviews about the app but you can't share their joy w/out paying $4 and some change. Whats gonna happen after that? Have to pay another five bucks for every useful tool this app claims to offer?Completely disappointed, this app has been a complete waste of time."
self direction,I thought it was clickbait,"When I tried the app, I thought it was going to show a bunch of ads and not work, instead it cleans my Fire and works mostly better."
self direction,Fast and improved speed.  Also helps with storage.,I've used for awhile and it always seems to speed up reaction time.
self direction,"Microtransaction ultimately required, but worth it.","Requires microtransaction to actually clean the system (not just scan), but once purchased it is super-convenient."
self direction,Somewhat unsure......,"I gave it a 3-star rating for one reason. If I am wrong (and these days that's entirely possible), please look at this as a higher rating. When I first ran a ""scan"" of my device (Kindle Fire), I saw the scan completed literally within seconds which I thought was good. Supposedly there were 2 potential things to worry about. To try and fix those two things however, it appeared as though there was a fee to be paid (can't remember what I thought it said). In effect, the only part of the APP that was free was the scan and not the resolution/removal of any potential problems with the device. If I am wrong......as I said....please look at this as an inaccurate rating and form your own opinion."
self direction,Works well,Works better than I thought it would...Great product. I use it almost daily
security,Bestsecurity app for kindke,This is a greatsecurity cleaning app for your kindle
self direction,OK on Kindle Fire,Use on Kindle fire. Would like to see more complete notes on actions.
self direction,garbage cleaned but it doesn't have malware,Thought this app would be a little more detailed
self direction,No Problems!,"After using a popular cleaner, booster, virus scanning program for several years it occured to me that on three different tablets - and a zillion scans -not one virus had ever been detected. Upon noticing this application was designed for Kindle Fire tablets I thought I'd give it a go. On the first scan two viruses were found, cleaned, and eliminated. Today fourteen more were discovered! The process is lightning fast - no long wait. My Kindle Fire is working great.  Plus, I like the fact that this application is providing a higher level of protection for my tablet. There's a huge investment of money, time, and irreplaceable information on my tablet. It's foolish not to protect it."
security,Questionable,"Can't see much difference in my Fire's performance, speed of uploading or anti-virus protection."
self direction,Appears to be a scam,"This app is a scam. Downloaded and ran it.  It reported there were 3 viruses but if you select the Clean button you are taken to a screen to BUY the ability to clean. I thought maybe it did not install right. So I uninstalled and reinstalled it. Ran the scan and now get a report that says I have 8 viruses. Clean still takes to page to buy cleaner capability.  So, at this point it looks like even the Scan function is a scam, reporting random different results from 2 different installs in less that 5 minutes.  I am surprised Amazon allows this deceptive practice. It appears Amazon does not vet the apps. Very disappointing."
self direction,Huh? What?,"After buying this app, which I'm thinking is a scam....why do I have to leave a review to get updates? I paid for it, I should get updates no matter what! And after all I'm reading, I can't help but feeling more to the point of this being a scam. I'll be calling Amazon for a refund and suggest they may want to test their products that they recommend....just a thought?!?!The initial use was surprisingly fast, said I had 8 viruses..I'm thinking malware may be just the same and that's free!!!"
self direction,"I thought it was free, but in the end ...","I thought it was free, but in the end it cost me $4.29. I could download part of it for free, but in order to make it work, it needed another part for $4.29"
security,Fantastic Buy!,Price is very reasonable for the protection it provides. I have a Kindle Fire. First scan revealed 9 viruses. Def recommend!
self direction,One Star,this wasn't what I thought it was and am glad it was free.
self direction,Thought I would try it. downloaded it and of ...,Thought I would try it.downloaded it and of course it said I had 5 viruses and if I wanted to get rid of them I had to pay to download there virus removal system . It a big scam to get you to buy there stuff when they tell you to down load there app for free .Don't do it!
self direction,great cleaner,Really helped my kindle fire to run better. Thought that it was free. Realized that the scan is free but to clean the fire you have to pay for the app.
self direction,Just give me the real deal and charge me up front,"I was very disappointed with this app. I thought it would be great to be able to scan and optimize my fire using a free app. However, all it does is scan, and then say you can fix any problems if you purchase the full app for $3.73. Just give me the real deal and charge me up front instead of wasting my time."
security,doing what it's supposed to do,Seems to work fine it's worth having a little extra protection.Even got it on sale!
self direction,not sure about this,I've been lookin for a GOOD cleanup app n thought this was it but I was WRONG
security,Fast and easy,Really nice protection and very easy to use.
self direction,Back On Track Fire,I thought my Fire was a done deal till I used this app. My Fire is back on Fire !!!
universalism,An app I keep returning to...,"This is an app I've used since it first appeared as a recommendation for Amazon Kindle Ã°??Â¥ users. I have never had to pay for it like so many of you  apparently did. Therefore, maybe it doesn't really do anything; I haven't the understanding of technology to be sure. I don't think it would ever clean nearly as much as CCleaner. But unless I've somehow completely stripped clean (something I understand to be detrimental to the health and long-life of all my devices) my Kindle it seems to pick a few odds and ends. Perhaps it addresses Kindle issues the all-around CCleaner misses. My girlfriend used it first and introduced it to me.5 stars Ã¢Â­ÂÃ¢Â­ÂÃ¢Â­ÂÃ¢Â­ÂÃ¢Â­Â because it does what I keep installing it to accomplish.  Don't raise expectations.*The most recent uninstall was because it seemed to get ""hooked-up"" within the workings of another app.  I am hoping the most recent update fixed this frustrating complication.

security,Junk... Don't waste your time...,"Wouldn't clean anything without buying full package. Said I have 13 viruses, but anothersecurity app detects none"
security,Effective product,Addedsecurity
security,Cool App.,I wanted some protection for my kind!e fire withokut having to pay a big fee. This is perfect and suits my needs.
self direction,Unhappy,"App is not working the way it was advertised.. Run scan, then clean, then scan again  same numbers of trash appears  wish I had my money back, I also don't understand why it says free, then to use it, you pay $4.99. I am not a novice user, but I thought free download meant free usage also."
self direction,Fast scanning. Only free for the scan. Bummer.,"Scans fast. Thought it was free, but only the scan was."
security,Optimized for Fire Kindle,Works great.  Got asecurity app?
security,Not Bad!,So far so good.  Simple.......has virus protection which is nice.
power,Great app. Very smooth with foscams,Great app.  Very smooth with foscams.  Controls mic and speakers very well. Love the Chromecast function.
security,Great features!,I use this with my homesecurity system. It works great. Together with IP Camera app I just turned by old phone into a baby monitor.
power,very helpfull camera monitor,allows you to see what you need and control your cameras wherever you are (with access to the internet of course).
security,Very Surprised and PLEASED!,"OK, I downloaded the free version of this a couple of months ago and it was ok if you want to see strange places, but that got boring real quick. As I was getting ready to completely remove it from my fire I decided to check it out one more time. When I did I decided to check out the upgrade and read up on what this was capable of, and I gambled the $3.49 and purchased it... I AM BLOWN AWAY! I can actually see my home on my fire from anywhere. I downloaded webcamXP 5 to my laptop(free) and I can see what my laptop's camera is seeing anytime from anywhere I can get online. I got an inhomesecurity system for less than 4 bucks! (I watched my dog meander through the house, always wondered what he did all day, lol). The webcamXP 5 program can actually be scheduled to turn on the camera whenever you want it. I LOVE this tinyCam Monitor PRO and I highly reccommend it. It works perfectly with my Kindle fire."
power,Good app,Works great with all my foscam cameras. Has some extra controls that sets it above some of the other apps out there. Keep up the good work.
security,Hobbled by Amazon,"It won't work with android wear watches. Which is why I purchased it. The description says it works with android wear watches. However, I get a pop-up that there is a bug with Amazon DRM protection. I don't like to give this a low reading, since it isn't the developers fault (if purchased from Google Play Store, it evidently works without a hitch). However, it still does not work as advertised."
power,i like,using this with Panasonic op cam.  the sound coming from the cam can be harsh and distorted at times.  wish this had a volume/gain control. using this on my kindle.fire.
power,good multi camera app,allows for multiple camera views at once controls are usable but does not scan Lan accurately does not detect my camera
power,Works great with Foscam IP Cameras,"I am very satisfied with tinyCam Monitor Pro.  I had tried four different ""free"" IP cam apps and decided to go with tinyCam due to it's ease of use and extra features such as support for 2-way audio and smooth PTZ controls.I am using this with Foscam FI9821P, FI9821W, and FI8910W IP cameras and this app does a great job for only a few dollars."
security,Perfect for homesecurity Monitoring,Great app. Easy to set up. Perfect app to view homesecurity cameras.
security,Using this app for years,"Of all of thesecurity camera apps I have, this one seems to work for all of them. It does not always support every function of the camera s. But at least it supports them."
power,Fantastic App,This is the best app I've ever installed on my phone. It connects to multiple brand cameras. You can see multiple cameras on a screen or individually. You can also control the camera with a touch control. It connects to my Panasonic camera allowing microphone and speaker functionality. It also allows zooming in. Even the original PC software cannot do that well.  Well worth it!
self direction,A goodsecurity camera monitor that takes technical skill to use and set up.,"This app allows you to monitor your videosecurity system at home.  Please be aware that if you are not on a WIFI you are using your mobile deviceÃ¢??s data plan and you may be using a lot of data transferring videos and photos.  You can actually make your Android device a mobile DVR.  Remember.  DonÃ¢??t forget your data plan limits.I own and use multiplesecurity camera and DVR systems within my home that monitor and record the video on internal hard disk drives.  All of them are accessible via the internet and WIFI as they all come with their own Apps that allow interfacing to my Android and Apple devices.  This software is thus redundant for me to use.When I first scanned my network for cameras the system found none.  It is because it was on the wrong WIFI network and I had to change the WIFI settings for my Samsung tablet to the same network that thesecurity system is on.  If you canÃ¢??t find your camera you have to go to your smart device settings and change the network access.  If you have not used that WIFI on your device you will have to know the SSID and the password for that WIFI system to sign on.Once I scanned the right network the system found my servers,security cameras and my ubiquity Network system.  I logged into the Foscam system and the app then asked me what the camera password was.  Remember you can lock yoursecurity DVRs and even individual cameras for privacy and you will have to know that data to sign on.  Upon entering the correct data the camera location popped up and displayed the cameraÃ¢??s live video.By tapping on the live video I was able to see the camera video full screen and touch the record icon and record the video.  You are also able to use the camera motion detection systems to minimize the amount of transferred data and only collect data when movement is present and being monitored.The benefit of this app is that you may be able to combine multiple camera networks into one app for monitoring and checking.  Just be aware that if you are not on the same WIFI network the ability to see the video may be blocked by your cable modem.  That is a long discussion and it is not possible to cover here. You can possibly even add in local camera if you have their IP address like a local school or weather network.  As part of a demo you can see random action cameras working around the world that are public for example.This is a nice app but again I warn you to be aware of your mobile data plan limits.  If you are not on a WIFI you could be using up your expensive data plan and get a big mobile bill from your supplier.  It will take some skill to connect and use this app and you should be aware of that requirement.  The app does work and deliver what it promises.Permissions:Ã¢?Â¢ Record audioÃ¢?Â¢ Modify or delete the contents of your USB storageÃ¢?Â¢ Full network accessÃ¢?Â¢ View network connectionsÃ¢?Â¢ Draw over other appsÃ¢?Â¢ Control vibrationÃ¢?Â¢ Prevent tablet from sleepingÃ¢?Â¢ Install shortcutsThis app contains adware using Google Mobile Ads (AdMob).

power,... app is top-notch if you have IP cameras you'd like to control remotely,"This app is top-notch if you have IP cameras you'd like to control remotely. I know most IP cameras offer some sort of proprietary app with limited features -- ""light versions"", and then also their own with advanced features -- ""pro versions"". I own 2 IP cameras, different models, but same company and still find that tinyCam Monitor PRO meets my needs.The camera discovery option is great. I like being able to press a button to have it discover all of the cameras on my network. The only problem I have with this is that it will use the local IP address to add it. If you plan to use the app away from home (outside of wifi range), you'll need to adjust the (advanced) IP settings accordingly. Also depending on your home setup, you may have to forward a couple ports etc.The PTZ (pan tilt zoom) is great -- you can use a single-button option, where you press and it moves a little, or you can use what I'll call a ""continuous"" version where you swipe and control the movement more fluidly.I really like having almost ALL of the same options the manufacturer's own software provides. Kudos to the developers on a great product!I received this product for free around June-ish -- I can't remember if it was an Amazon promotion or one from the developer. I only was able to review it now since I only now have compatible IP cameras. With that said, trying to add a camera that isn't network-discoverable (through the built-in search option) offers plenty of manufacturers. If you go to the developers website they have an easier to follow list of compatible machines."
security,Simple and it works,I have asecurity system with three different brands of ip cameras.  TinyCam auto-discovered them all and I had it working in under five minutes.  The interface is clean and user-friendly .  I recommend this product.
power,Works for Viewing but I'm unable to find/use the Pan/Tilt (ptz) controls.,"This app works, so it at least deserves 3 stars. However I've been unable to figure out how to use the Pan/Tilt controls at all using the Remote for the Amazon Fire Stick (there are only so many buttons on the remote and none of them seem to be related to the ptz controls). Yes I can view the camera, but an important part (for me at least) in it being useful is the ability to pan/tilt. If someone see's this and would be able to explain how to make the camera move with the Fire Stick Remote, or I manage to figure it out myself, I'd be very grateful and would be happy to update this review."
power,Great If Using Multiple Camera Brands,"I use it for the different cameras in my home but mostly with the baby cam because it's native app SUCKS BALLS (D-Link!). I wish I could have a little more control of the camera options with this app but it is understandable for a third party app. I don't know if it's user error or an issue with the app but I seem to not be able to get sound from the baby cam, either."
self direction,Truly is the 'Swiss Knife' to IP cameras.,Truly is the 'Swiss Knife' to IP cameras.  I'm using mine with the Wyze cams.  Perfect for serving my cams to ActionTiles.
power,This app made my Wyze cam setup even more functional as a homesecurity system.,"This app works like a charm. I walked through the setup and added my wyze cam info for each cam and now I can see all 4 at once, Cycle through each manually or automatically. I can even control the Wyze pan & zoom camera from the firetv remote. The best part is it is a local app running through the router in my home so there is no lag even when watching all 4 at once. This app made my Wyze cam setup even more functional as a homesecurity system. I can not recommend this app enough."
self direction,No good on Fire TV,Freezes on Fire TV. Pretty much useless. Will update thoughts if they fix the app.
self direction,Had to delete app,I never actually got to use the app so I really can't comment on it's performance.All I know is after I downloaded the app it drove mysecurity apps crazy I was unable to perform any action without receiving a pop up about the app.I am a decent tech savy individual but I couldn't get the app set to hault mysecurity apps from trying to remove it so I finally just removed the app.

power,Just works with my Foscam Cameras,"Terrific camera app.  I put in my settings for my two IP cams and presto!  The remote controls work perfectly.  I can move the camera, toggle sound, even speak through the camera's built in speakers from my smartphone (okay, that last feature is a bit spooky).  No tedious setup."
security,The Best Android CCTV Camera Aggregator / NVR / Server,"I love this software. I use Blue Iris on a PC to manage four different brands ofsecurity cameras, to watch over our other house. TinyCam has a built in web server, and motion and sound detection, and it could be used as your NVR/alarm.We have a site-to-site VPN set up with the location we monitor, and distribute the connection to the B.I. server and various TVs and phones in the house that run TinyCam. When away from home, VPN client software on phones does the trick, giving us convenient and very secure access to our cameras.TinyCam is just plain awesome."

self direction,Handy cam viewer,"Seems to be a pretty good camera app with a lot of useful function and a well-thought-out user interface. It's at least as good as IP Cam Viewer Pro, the other app I've used for a while to monitor my home cameras when I'm away. The only problem I have with it is that the app-to-camera voice function doesn't seem to work with my Foscam 18918W camera."
power,This is my favorite camera monitor software,This is my favorite camera monitor software.  The feature set is quite comprehensive.  I have it configured to pull live feeds from D-Link and Foscam cameras.  It can remotely control my Foscam (PTZ) and the recording of live video to my smartphone is a handy feature!
self direction,Did not work; not sure why?,Purchased to use with a Foscam unit.  I could find the camera but never could get it to connect.  I suspect it would have eventually worked with enough tinkering but I thought the help and support resources were lacking.
power,"Keep an eye on your property from your phone, tablet and computer!",Best app Ever! I use this app all the time to watch my car and my patio door. It records images and sends them to my email. View live and it's only a spit sec. difference in time. Control your camera right from the app. We plan to add more cameras.

The user interface is pretty smart as well, clean when you want it to be and full of options when you need them. If you set up your cameras properly you should be up and running within no time, controlling PTZ and everything! Works with RaspberryPi video streaming (Motion) and foscam fi9821w v2"

self direction,Works so well I want to get more cameras!,"Works great with my 3 Foscam Wifi P/T cameras!I tried the free version to verify that it could connect and operate my cameras, and it worked great, so I upgraded to the paid version (easy setup with the convenient export/import feature - very well thought out). The PRO features are totally worth the price.FastThis app works easily and the control/response from the camera is much faster than the app I was using on my iPhone. There is a lot of extra functionality like motion/audio detection and auto-recording and uploading. My kids like to turn the motion alarm on, and see if they can ""Ninja"" past the kitchen cam undetected (worth $3 right there just for the sustained silence/giggles from them!).Works on Fire StickI hadn't even thought of trying this on the Fire TV Stick until I read a few reviews here. I was really happy to see that it worked pretty well (the navigation is a little challenging, but you get used to it), and I was glad that one purchase gets me an app on 2 devices! Knowing that this works nicely on the Fire Stick opens up a bunch of possibilities for monitoring.Works great on Kindle Fire HDI can view all 3 cams at once, see/hear the motion alarm go off when there is movement, easily record, and do all the things you could imagine you would want to do in asecurity cam app.The Kindle Fire I have doesn't have a mic, but I read that headphones w/mic might work, and was very happy to find that my iPhone headphones work w/the Kindle, and I can talk/listen over the cameras with 'reasonable' clarity! I had pretty much given up on being able to talk over the cams, as all the apps I had tried in the past would send such garbled sound, (worse than Charlie Brown's teachers...kids look it up) and I couldn't get any mobile/desktop app to work with the Foscam 9821W talk functionality. This is the first app that lets me talk to that cam, and it works great!securityIt is great that SSL and encrypted password features are available, and work well, allowing you to access/control your cameras externally, but securely.The software is well designed and seems to be updated pretty frequently, as you can see from the support site: http://tinycammonitor.com/changelog.htmlNit-picks:- I wish the default view would have the movement controls- The 'preset' functions don't work for me"
power,Great app with a lot of options and control,Great app with a lot of options and control. Background audio feature is key for baby monitor. Paired with Foscam Fl9821W V2.
power,best ipcamera app,I'm not very technical but was able to set up this in minutes.  Very easy setup and great layout for easy control.  Me and my wife use this app to monitor our younger kids after school.  It is very useful and has all the bells and whistles.  Would definitely recomend this app to anybody looking for a full featured easy to use ipcamera app.  Also in my opinion it is very worth it to upgrade to the pro version.

The new feature for DVR is also pretty neat, can take and old device and turn it into a ultra low power ultra convert DVR device.If your looking for an app to get, this is the one.  And hey it has a free version as well so you can try before you buy."

Great control on accessing the cam and swivel it around, with great easy buttons on taking instant photos and video.  Highly recommend it to all users."
security,NOT Dependable,"I got this app to use with my Fire TVs and at first it worked great.  However, I have since wasted many hours setting this up with the 16 D-linksecurity cameras I have, only to see the app suddenly quit working and have to go through the whole process again.  I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app, fiddled with all the complicated settings, and am just tired of dealing with it now.  II am pretty tech savy but the aggravation just isn't worth it and I do NOT recommend this"
power,"Good program, lack luster support.","Does a great job showing and controlling cameras.  Contacted support to have h264 support for my 933L.  They wanted to access the camera.  I set up a guest account, then they disappeared.  They have it for other models in the same line and their compatibility document says it is supported.  Without it, streaming is very slow.  So double check your compatible cameras.  Would give more stars but..."
security,"Works good, but it has a problem","I have 5security cameras in a closed network being displayed. There is no internet access. The software is powerful, but easy to setup at the same time. The problem that I'm having is that it will only work for about 15 to 20 minutes, then the software blows up. If I provide internet access, it works perfect. The developer has not responded to my email.  I'm still looking to a solution."

self direction,"Runs terrible on Fire TV Stick with HD cameras, acceptable on Gen I Fire tablet","Don't see too many reviews of this app for the 1st gen Fire TV stick and specific camera models so adding my experience here. Bought the app since I had good experience with it before on a 2012 Nexus 7 with Foscam 8910W (480P) cameras.Fast forward a few years and i've since added Foscam 9821 (720P) and Amcrest IP2M-841 (1080P) cameras as well and thought over the weekend that it would be nice to be able to see the cams on a large TV via the Fire TV stick.Checked the amazon app store and saw that the app is listed as compatible so without hesitation I bought it given the good experience before. First the good, the scan feature is very good and picked up IP addresses, custom ports, camera make, model correctly for the most part so all I had to do was confirm cameras and enter user name and password. There was a bit of a learning curve to using the fire tv remote to navigate but do able.Now the bad, the 480p cameras worked fine as expected getting about 14-15 fps which is in line with MJPEG camera frame rates; video is reasonably smooth. The 720p cameras were disappointing at 9-10 fps, we're in choppy video territory here now. The 1080p camera was inexcusably bad at ~4 fps, we're talking someone walking across the room looks like they are teleporting 3ft forward at a time. This is all using the built in app's hardware acceleration setting.I reached out to support and he advised that the Fire TV is slow hardware and essentially to lower my resolution on the camera or get better hardware like an Nvidia shield. The Fire TV stick while slow overall can play 1080P videos from Amazon, Netflix, Plex, etc so I think I was somewhat reasonable in my expectation that H264 cameras would work fine with the hardware provided but I guess I was wrong.I will try limiting the app to one camera next to see if that improves the performance.Edit Mar 2017:Removed all the 480P cameras and now only have 2 cameras connected to the app: one 720P Foscam and one 1080P Amcrest, FPS has now improved when in full screen mode: 720P camera fluctuates between 6-10 FPS but seems to stabilize out around 10 FPS, still choppy video overall but usuable as a baby cam and not for any kind of detailed viewing/recording, 1080P camera seems to stabilize around 14-16 FPS and under low motion appears reasonably smooth but again not what you'd want for detailed viewing/recording.When both cameras are on screen in the multicam view, both slow down to about 7 FPS and basically unusable past the point of a series of slow moving pictures but if all you need is any kind of visual like a camera in the garage to verify if the door is open or closed....it'll do.I have the app running on 2 1st gen Fire TV sticks bought at the same time; one seems to like the HW decoding better and the other does better in HW mode. Same app, same generation hardware, same cameras, perhaps there are hardware differences inside?The moment I try adding the 480P cameras back in the mix, performance suffers again. I also tried using with just the 1080P cam and it only picked up another 1-2 FPS.Installed the app on a Gen I Fire tablet as well and using with only the 1080P camera in HW mode, am getting 30 FPS in daylight but expect that IR performance at night will likely suffer as well.Conclusion: use with 2 H264 cameras at most on a Gen I Fire TV stick and Gen I Fire tablet. If you have the hardware already like I did, it's ok value to get a little bit of extra utility out of them."

The app is perfectly reliable and pretty intuitive to use.Two complaints for the developers.1) The manual panning controls are bad enough to be useless (I have two Foscam cameras). The controls basically only go all the way up, down, left, or right and offer no fine tuning. Fortunately, I rarely ever need the panning controls, but it would be nice if they worked when needed.2) Recording of videos does not record the audio with the video making the video recording feature pretty meh."

The Fire TV Stick is basically just Android, so the app that is on the FireTV is the exact same app you would have on your phone, minus some features.I don't know if it's a limitation of the FireTV Stick or what, but the video skips like crazy, it's poor quality. On my phone it looks amazing. I'm guessing this issue a lot has to do with RAM or maybe CPU speed.

You can backup your data, share it, and even send screenshots from the camera. Really cool stuff.At some point in the last year, however, an update came out that rendered the app useless on the Kindle Fire. It opens, loads live view, then proceeds to freeze - and when I say freeze - the whole device locks up, requiring a hard reset.I've now tried this on 2 Fires - one which is rooted and running a fresh Jelly Bean ROM - so its not the Kindle OS. Something with this app does not jive with the hardware, and now I'm out $4. Very, very irritating."

The issue started after the latest update to tiny cam.  The app will start to bring up mysecurity cam's and promptly lock up the fire. The kindle fire then must be hard reset by holding the power button in tell it shuts off.  I see other reviews with the same issue and it has been at enough time to pull the update and fix it.

self direction,good until amazon app store app messed it up,"To be fair the camera app works as described and rates 4 stars based on it alone.  However, since the last Amazon app store app upgrade all apps free or paid for through the app store require you to login to amazon each time you use the app or the app won't run.  If they did this for apps advertised as free it would be wrong but no loss since you paid nothing and can get the same free apps from other sources.  But to require login for an app you bought and paid for, like this cam app, is more then wrong it boarders on scam!I don't want to here android 4.2 is the cause crap either.  Amazon's app store app, before their upgrade, did not have this. I also don't want to here they are working on it.  They should provide the older app store app and send out an update or back date notice to everyone unfortunate enough to have downloaded the latest update.  Sorry for the harsh words but this situation is nothing more then an ill thought out control mechanism and Amazon should know better."

self direction,Tools work great but loses files,"The app works great for reading and annotating PDFs.  I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1, and I'm finding it fairly intuitive to use the tools to mark up PDFs with the stylus.  But there is a bug or some other problem that has caused me a big headache.  Twice, my marked-up document has disappeared from storage, causing me to have to redo hours' worth of work.  This happened with two different documents.

stimulation,**Watch your generous donations build the pyramids..!**,"Although it's not identical, this game reminds me a bit of Heroes of Kalavela. It features the same kind of oddball mixture of game genres, all orbiting around a central, Match 3 core. The other genres (adventure, city building) are supposed to provide an interesting and engaging rationale for the dozens upon dozens of repetitive Match 3 rounds you'll be playing. However, if you like Match 3 games a lot to begin with, you won't need this rationale, and if you don't, the rationale/sideshow in this game probably won't be enough to keep you playing. What this game really is--and, in this, it's exactly like a thousand other games--is a surfeit of busywork game mechanics designed to coax your money from your wallet in all the usual ways. It's no worse than those thousand other games in this respect, but it's no better, either.Bottom line: if you like Match 3 games, the core gameplay here is solid and silly-free. If you don't, or if you're put off by stuff getting constantly thrown in the way of your Match 3 joy, you'll probably not be very long in invoking your Ultimate Spell of Uninstall. (And, obviously, if you're one of those who avoids coin whore, IAP games on principle, you'll want to miss this one out, although IAP's arent technically necessary in order to complete the game, AFAICT.)"

self direction,Nothing is ever free play.,For a while I thought I had found a game where you could actually play for free and get some progression. Silly me.  Had a five day event where you earned crystals and if you reached 160 you'd get to keep however many you earned. Reached 160 two days before end of event and game said I could pay $11.99 to get the bank early. Event ended late last night so logged in today and got a message I could buy the 200 crystals I had earned for $11.99. Slick. Obviously this is only going to get worse.

I have a good group of friends playing this game, but I am unable to give them the gifts they deserve.  I would suggest eight gifts per day, one to each gifted.  Also, I would like to see more crystals being rewarded to players.Other than the above, I think you have developed a wonderful game that is in the top five I love to play.  Keep up the creativity.  Thank you for hours of playing pleasure!!!P.S. I would love to see you develop a game similar in style, but about the search for Atlantis."
stimulation,"fun, but too much repetition","This is a fun game, but there are way too many challenges introduced, each which take way too many components to complete. If they cut these down to a third, it would be more challenging. They way it is now, there isn't much that makes you want to complete a challenge, because there are 20 more going on at the same time."
stimulation,Great game,I find this game a challenge to play.  Love this game

self direction,This game has the potential of being great fun but there's a whole lot of in-action going ...,"This game has the potential of being great fun but there's a whole lot of in-action going on.  Great news - it's free!  That's a plus.  And there aren't a bunch of pop ups trying to get me to spend money.  But there are some.  Bad news - it's slow to open up and it's slow to do everything.  I just want to play the tiles game or the tablets (match 3 and 4).  I don't care about building the village but hey I've built up all this gold and points and emeralds and I don't mind spending those freebies on something but dang it takes so much time and getting to the next game takes forever; like about 10 steps.  I actually look forward to loosing a game because that's the only time the option of replaying that game comes up and it's immediate.So for the game playing itself, I'm in.  But for the whole process, I'm about to uninstall it."
stimulation,good combo,Fun. Good combo of different challenges
stimulation,good,"Annoying that the only way to have friends is through Facebook, and that there are challenges that require purchases.  But overall a fun game."

stimulation,Fantastic Game,Awesome addicting game.Love the challenges
stimulation,Addictive,Learning this game.the more I play  the better  I get! There is always a new challenge every dayLove this game!
stimulation,I liked it until I wrote this review,"It's a challenge. I play everyday and inch toward the next level. It's satisfying to a point. If you have some money laying around, It's definitely set up to buy your way through it. The daily rewards are crap, need to make it worth coming back. When I play a level for a cat, I want a cat, not a friggin bone (players know what I mean). The occasional app resets are stupid. I've never played a game that resets in the middle of play. I've lost some valuable pieces because of this. Hmm, maybe that's part of the plan...  Anyhow, I started out with 4 stars and ended with 1."

stimulation,fun game.,Enjoying the challenge.
self direction,Fun,"Great game, but reaction time is slow."
stimulation,Cradle of Empires,Love the game. Very challenging. The only problem with me is I can't play long because it's expensive for in house apps tokens.  One shot is 9-13 tokens and takes 3-4 tries to get one card...I still rated for the 5 Star  challenge...
stimulation,Cradle of Empire s,"Fun game to play, but is slow. I like the variety of games and challenges."
stimulation,One of the better ones,"I like the story line, the individual challenges and that you can choose on each level which you want to play. There are different option of how to play... the most challenging for me is the skull thing, without giving to much away.."
stimulation,Not a fan,"Well, since I can't connect with anyone to help with game play and you don't offer any specials, I really don't play much. Nice concept. Graphics are pretty basic. Love the challenge the boards give, but without help they're too hard to accomplish anything within the time restraints you place on some of the boards. Could have been a great game."
stimulation,fun and interesting,Great challenge and fun!
self direction,upset a d frustrated,"I have been trying to access cradle of empires for the past week. I thought it needed updating........but NO!!!!! I have removed it and reinstalled, turned off device, looked for updates......nothing.Is there a reason this is happening that I don't know about?It seems other players are having the same problem."
stimulation,Outstanding,Played Bejewled for years. Adding in a story line with adventure and treasurer hunting makes it even more fun and interesting to play
self direction,5 stars,Very fun well thought out game.
power,Game seems programmed to force purchasing,"Beware. Started off as a really fun app. And, yes, I got caught up in buying additional ""jewels"" to spend to get to additional levels. As I continued playing the app, the levels got more difficult--expected--but then it seemed like match 3s were intentionally falling/programmed so that in order to complete a level, I would have to buy more ""jewels"" to get more ""energy points."" I started controlling myself by saying that I would play the game infrequently as my natural energy points built up...it takes about 5.5 hours to restore energy. As I learned not to buy then the app started crashing. I'd get close to winning and the system crashed out and rebooted making me have to start the game over.It is possible that the crashing is unaffiliated with my self control and refusal to buy energy points, but it is suspicious that the game worked perfectly until I learned self-control.I'm hoping that the sudden crashing of my system is just a bug that needs to be fixed but I'll probably delete the game if this continues."
stimulation,My favorite match three game yet!,"The worst thing about this game is that I seem to be addicted!  It's a match three game with quests and story, and interesting challenges.  Much better than that popular game that I used to play."
self direction,Good Matching Game,"I like this game because it's entertaining and addicting.  The only downside is, it gets hard to collect things you need to go to the next level.  I have actually tried to finish at least 2 collections for about 2 months.  Also, the energy (on the game) you spend, seems to last less and less.Other than those things, the action and story make it fun."
stimulation,Better than the usual matching game!,The added story line and item searches make this an interesting and fun challenge.
self direction,a little slow,But a fun and well thought out game.
stimulation,fun for me,Easy enough but still enough of a challenge.
stimulation,entertaining storyline,Entertaining storyline. Good challenges to keep you interested.
self direction,Great Ancient Game,I have been playing this game for about a month now and I am loving it.  The challenge gets harder and harder as you go along.  In the beginning it seemed a bit easy but no longer.  Thanks for creating a game that gives me a great challenge!
self direction,fun to play,I'm having more fun than I thought I would! Will recommend.
stimulation,Not as it appears,"I was very disappointed in this game. All the exciting challenges you see on the advertisings must be far into the game, because at the beginning levels there's nothing different from other ""Match 3"" games. You also can't play very long without needing to spend real money for more lives, or whatever they call it in this game. I deleted the game and won't get sucked in again."
self direction,"VERY linear, but may be fun for some.","Cradle of Empires is a base building/match 3 game. When I got C radle of Empires, I was looking forward to a game that focused mainly on the base building game and not so much on the match 3 portion, but I was dissapointed to find it focusing mainly on the match 3 mechanic. At the begining you start off with one builing, and to get more you have to level up. To level up, you have to play the match 3 levels, which each building has 8 of. To even simply upgrade the building, you must get a 3 star on each of these levels. I am a person who does not like match 3 gameplay very much, and so I thought this feature really diminishes the base buildig portion of the game, which it does. So if you are looking for a base builder do not get this game. Also, the story of the game is totally pointless. Mostly, the people of your town, which there are very few of, just want you to find them some pointless item in one of the levels and your reward is just a bit of XP. The whole story of the game is just a collectathon. The game is also very linear because all you do is have someone tell you what to do, do it, repeat. So to me, this game was boring, linear, and pointless. The only reason I gave it a 2 star was because for some people, who like match 3 games more, might actually think this game would be fun and if the creators did a better jobs at the levels, I would too."
self direction,Inaccurate Clicks,"Whenever I click a gem in the game, there's a half chance it'll register that click as somewhere else on the board, and a quarter chance it won't register the click at all. An example is, earlier today I clicked a gem in the upper right corner of the game board, and it registered the click in the bottom left! Sometimes it's just an adjacent piece, but the location of the selection seems random and completely independent of where I actually touched the screen.Also, there's never enough energy, but the fact I want to keep playing after I've run out must mean I like it."
self direction,:-),Fun distraction
self direction,It's better than I thought it would be,It's better than I thought it would be.
self direction,Improving opinion,I thought it would be more like the ad but I like the Egyptian theme.

stimulation,Wonderland,"I love this game, there are so many wonderful levels and surprise additional prize winning adventures."
stimulation,New to the game,Interesting mix of adventure and matching games. Fun so far. Looking forward to explore more levels
stimulation,One Star,Not much of a challenge. But I have just began playing
stimulation,I like it but...........,"I would suggest that if you pass a level that your energy isn't deducted. But if you fail it then energy be deducted. It seems fair that way. Also it would be nice if it were more incentives like a tournament or daily challenge. I would like for the game data to be saved ,so if you log in on another device that your progress is saved. Other than that I like the game so far."
stimulation,Cradle of Empires,"I would have given 4 stars if I could have been able to connect to Facebook. I sent them an email but they have not responded yet. Otherwise it is a fun game, it's a new twist on a match 3 game which is nice. If you enjoy building things, some adventure, match 3, and goals to meet during the game then this is the game for you."

I would like to see yet another slot to choose from beside the two girls in the future.  Thanks guys...good job."
stimulation,Frustrating annoying challenging fun,I've had the game for a while and until recently my main complaint was that it didn't update enough so the game didn't grow. I no longer have that complaint so I can now honestly give the game 5 stars. Another reviewer complained that it is hard to earn all five items to complete a collection. I agree but I find that most of my problems are more due to my not searching for the collection items in the order recommended by the game. I've been more concerned with earning the rewards that comes from collecting all the stars within a house than  collecting collection items. But I think that that's the beauty of this game. You see because each person has a different strategy for working the game every person ends up playing a different version of the game. It's frustrating when I'm close but don't complete the puzzles correctly. I hate using the outside aids. But when one puzzle annoys me I either try another puzzle or another house. The games a great indicator of how I'm feeling during a day also. If I keep making careless mistake it means my concentration is shot. I truly enjoy the challenges this game provides.
stimulation,fun!,The game is fun. I like trying to complete challenges
stimulation,Play it and see,Love the graphics and sound tracts. Quite hard at times but I love a good challenge
stimulation,Challenging and Unique - WHOOPS!  NOT SO FAST.  EDITED AND AMENDED REVIEW.,"WARNING ABOUT GAME UPDATE:  So, after my review earlier today, I updated my game from the app store.  Immediately it became impossible to play the game.  It kept freezing and freezing and freezing.  You shouldn't UPDATE the game.  Apparently updating will screw up the game play.I tried everything to fix the problem.  I closed and opened the game.  I powered off the Kindle and restarted it.  Finally, I stupidly uninstalled and reinstalled the game.  This works with Panda Pop, because the info shares from Facebook.  But, I should have known, that didn't work for this game.  I ended up at the beginning again, losing all progress.I AM UNINSTALLING THE GAME.  I DON'T HAVE TIME TO PLAY GAMES THAT ARE GLITCHED.  And, I take back my earlier statement, ""This game is lots of fun with many challenging levels and a unique back story.  If people like match three games with a twist, this is the game for them.""  The game IS fun, and I like a challenge, but I don't want to have to deal with customer service people every time I update a game.  So, be aware that updates may screw you up.  Good luck to all you other players, but I'm out of here."
self direction,Craddle of Empirges,Not as much fun as I thought it would be
self direction,Boring and inane,"This kept coming up as an ad while playing spider solitaire. Thought it might be interesting, wrong! It spends so much time doing inane thinvs on the screen, and without telling you why, that you quickly get tired of plsying along and not actually playing."
self direction,Decent Game,"Fun, though still chock-full of micro transactions."
stimulation,Pay Attention,"Could be a confusing but fun journey. Don't know where to go next in this game, so if your heads not in move on to simpler games. The challenge is rum, so far."
self direction,Cradle of empires,The game is totally mesmerizing and thought provoking. The developers have done a great job but are still listening to customers an making improvements asked for.
power,Hate the Way You Cannot Move at Times,"Too often, I waste time trying to make my next move.  This is especially ridiculous on timed games.  First, I have to wait to move, and that includes even when I attempt your selection.  Then, when I can finally select a square, the game moves it where it wants, not allowing me to make a move.  You can make suggestions, but they shouldn't keep me from moving and you should NEVER, EVER override my  choices!  This has stopped me from progressing as I see no way to handle timed mode as you  control the board.  I am playing the Kindle version.  Other version s may be more honest."
stimulation,CoE is the game for me.,"Super fun and challenging. When I need to kill some time or just to keep my brain cells working. Wonderful characters that give you the story lines. Have been looking for NEW game to challenge me, this is it."
self direction,Ridiculously Difficult,"I like this game and wanted to play and even spent over $50. playing. However it quickly became no fun. I don't know who thought it is fun waiting 10 hours to regain your playtime (@ 200 energy for example) or losing every game during those few minutes of play. The games requirements to win are mostly impossible unless you buy tools from the store. The blitz mode can be as low as 15 seconds, the games that have obstacles that reappear do so twice as fast as you items moving off the board, collections are hard to combine because several collections need the same item and they are not readily given. Or match 100 each of two different items in a minute thirty seconds. This game requires too much money to progress. When games stop being fun or interesting it's time to move on."
self direction,Winner's should have more lives,I love the game on!y if you so  you should gIn a life not loose  life.Just  good thought
stimulation,fun and different,Quests and characters make this an adventure!
stimulation,Just awful,"This game is a ripoff! I know. How can a free game be a ripoff? As you complete match challenges, you collect special items. If you need a specific item you can tap on it and it will direct you to the exact match puzzle you need to complete to get that item. Good luck with that, 'cause it'll probably take you three days to get it. What's the point? You NEED these items to progress. I'm done. Way more match games out there. Sad because I love their PC games, like Cradle of Persia. This one sucks."
stimulation,Interesting...,"There's enough challenges in the game to keep it interesting, however overdone the storyline might be."
stimulation,Cradle of Empires is fun!!!,This match 3 game is loads of fun to play! It has an Egyptian theme and has many different challenges to give you an opportunity to solve the puzzles. Solve the match challenge to find a needed item to help you advance. Try it! You'll like it!
stimulation,"love it, but...","Love the variety of challenges and I love the actual match 3 game play, but everything costs way too much. I get that the app is free and all but this game is kinda pushy with them wanting you to spend money."
stimulation,Load yrouble,Fun challenge game but it keeps saying there's an interval problem & causing problems to play
stimulation,ok game,Game is fun. Challenges are easy. What I don't like is the long wait for energy. Other than that a good game.
stimulation,Enjoy the challenge!,Love the challenge but it's obviously rigged at certain points.
self direction,... I am finding the game to be a bit tedious. I like the playing screens but don't care ...,At this point I am finding the game to be a bit tedious.  I like the playing screens but don't care for the interaction in between with the game's characters.  I don't want to have to read and prefer to simply advance to the next level and keep playing.

stimulation,Cradle of Empires,Challengeing  game.  Love it

self direction,DonÃ¢??t know,Just donÃ¢??t like the game. ItÃ¢??s not what I thought it was
stimulation,Good challenge,I wasn't sure when I downloaded this app but it has a nice story line that the puzzles fit into.  They are challenging but build so I felt like I was ready for the next challenge as it progressed.  Fun game.  Can spend money in it but don't have to.
stimulation,great,Love it each puzzle is an challenge.  Give it a try
stimulation,Addictive!,"Addictive.  Have spent too much, but like the challenges."
stimulation,"Good game, not. needing internet connection",Love the story and the challenge.
stimulation,Challenging,A unique way to learn about an ancient culture and way of life.  Needs a little more instruction/hints when required to build new structure.  Love the additional challenge of night vision.
stimulation,Decent app but...,"The concept is great and the puzzles are challenging, but I feel as if the app aggressively pursues in game purchasing. Within a few days I ran into challenges where in game currency was a must or I would be stuck at the same puzz!e indefinitely. I haven't run into a puzzle game, until now, that stopped being fun and started reaching for my wallet in only a few day's time. The devs are also kinda stingy in the free power ups and free gems department from what I have seen, which hampers free to play gamers. Add to that issues with the program realizing that the board has no moves, which can take seconds. If Columns in the 90's could react immediately to a board with no moves, I expect the same from an app in 2017, especially one that wants my money so badly.But, yeah, cool concept."
self direction,Not for me,"I'm sure it's a fun game for some, but I found it a little confusing. Just when I thought  had a level completed it took me back to do over?"
self direction,Three Stars,I just didn't like it as much as I thought I would.
stimulation,Fun but repetitive,Fun but would like a few different challenges vs just moving tiles to now up the boxes.
stimulation,day by day growth,Love the way the village grows and some of the matching games are a challenge.
self direction,"I like the game, but...","I find that I am playing this game more than I thought I would.  But, for those of us getting on in years there are certain aspects that are a little too challenging. You are required to play in timed mode often, and the time allotted is quite small. Also it has a faded mode which if your eyesight isn't great is already hard, but they also put a fast timer on that one too.  What I try to do is play on one of the other modes and hope the one I need will eventually change to an easier mode, which is probably why I have been playing it more than I thought I would. You also have to complete collections which can be quite costly because the item you need never seems to surface. So I have a lot of uncompleted collections waiting to be filled because I don't want to spend my charger items on something now when I may need it more later."
power,Won't download up,Every time I open app it says downloading and it does nothing. Status shows it's downloading nothing an is stuck at this point for over a week now. Deleting this app.

My issues are it will not update on my Kindle Fire and would not load onto my new  Kindle Fire HD"
stimulation,Great Adventure Match 3 game,Really good and fun. Lots of challenges and levels. Can play for hours. Gotta try this one.
stimulation,Four Stars,"The challenges to complete a level are good and also frustrating at times, especially when the view is blocked."
stimulation,Fun game,Overall well done game. My only complaint is the night challenge is seriously flawed. The city building is a nice twist.
stimulation,great app to play.,Great app full of fun and excitement.
stimulation,mostly good,"I love how you can build up to 3 stars and the levels change from numbered moves to timed and such makes it fun since its not always the same thing. That being said I don't like having to buy things, why not make a special challenge or things to collect to make a potion for extra energy, that would be great."
stimulation,Very cleverly programmed,I really enjoy this game. I think the creator were very clever when they designed it. I have been hooked since I started to play. I love all the different challenges and things to do.
stimulation,quest for life,Fun game. Just enough challenge to keep me playing
self direction,Not impressed,"I just bought a new Kindle and thought I'd try a new game. While the Kindle doesn't have any problems with other games, it is very slow with this game. Tapping on a dialogue box or selecting an item is often an exercise in futility. I could tap until the cows come home, but nothing will happen. How frustrating it is."
stimulation,great graphics,Enjoy the challenges
stimulation,Great mental getaway,I love playing this game. Each level brings new challenges. Just wish the storylines were less lengthy. I don't care about the story as much as the challenges.

universalism,Don't download unless you are willing to spend serious money,"The game is great when getting though the matching process but like most games of this nature players are nickel and dime to death to keep progressing.  I was very sad,  I truly enjoyed the game until I recognized exactly how much it was costing me.  I wish Amazon would bring back the underground"
stimulation,Nice match three game,This is a fun game. You could play it without the in game purchases.  A few purchases will make the game a little easier and let you play a little longer.  Challenges get harder as you master the game so you don't get bored. I wish there were fewer pop-up in game purchases notifications but I am just impatient.
stimulation,awesome game,I like the challenges that u have to clear the board to earn your prizes.I also like the color scheme.

self direction,Five Stars,lots of fun creating new Indians huts and bildings
self direction,Slow going,"Love the game but it's so slow moving at advancement and don't get me started on how little energy they give you for playing rounds as you level up you should get more energy to play the rounds oh that's right you have to buy a ton of gems for energy which is always the problem with these games. I love playing games and am very particular on the games I do play so I don't have very many downloads of games then there's the ones that rip you off was playing a game and was very high level wise I bought some gems for that game and was vCard ripped off twice each 10.00 I don't know about other players but I budget for this entertainment and can't afford to be ripped off so I quit playing that game I truly wish I could design a game because I would make it affordable and have quest that earned you your gems or whatever the need to buy items, energy or whatever the need.let's say I could design a game just don't know how to do technically. But this game could be so much better. Needs faster advancement, more energy to play levels and way to earn gems besides buying them. These games are all about the in game purchases which is sad cause you know Xbox,PlayStation, Nintendo and other gaming system games don't require all those purchases for advancement they wouldn't stay in business much less buy games that requires in game purchases just saying. Independent game developers and designers who want to advance in the gaming world would become more popular if they just had more to offer gamers that love playing games on their kindle(like me) or iPad which I refuse to buy Apple products because everything has to be bought that's Apple compatible I'm strictly a droid person and I got hooked on kindle gaming because my children and ex husband were always on the Xbox or PlayStation or Wii which I got so I could game but it was taken over also so I'm pretty stuck gaming on my kindle, laptop or phone which I now enjoy except for in app purchases and or slow moving games. Guess I had a mouthful but frustrated by most game app's."

My email says I purchased them, but not there. It'll probably be there after this review, but pointless now. This has happened before, but losing my patience."
stimulation,Entertaining,Its entertaining and challengeing. Beautiful scenery  too. Definitely worth installing to pass the time way.
stimulation,Basic Match 3 with added City building challenge!!!!,"I've only been playing this game a couple of hours and so far, it's really good. It's basically just like any other Match 3 game with the added challenge of rebuilding a city.You get coins and other resources that have to be spent wisely to rebuild the various parts of the city.Just like other Match 3 games, you use energy for each puzzle that you solve but the energy replenishes over time.All in all, a good game considering the Match 3 gameplay. So far, I'm having fun and...we'll just see how far I can get!!!"
stimulation,A challenge,Is a nice game with a challenge
stimulation,Great game,I really like doing 3 match games but with this one it's also an adventure.
stimulation,Fun!!!,Fu. Game with a little challenge.
stimulation,Awesome!,It's a fun game with  exciting quests and cool adventures!
power,fun to play,"The cursor is a bit tough to control during night mode, but otherwise pretty fun to play. Finding the items gives you a specific goal which is missing in many match 3 games."
stimulation,Fun,Thank you for the adventures..
stimulation,Interesting game,"I'm not sure I understand the whole concept, but I'm enjoying the challenges."
stimulation,This game keeps moving along!,I've been playing the game for two straight days now. Lots of fun and lots of challenges!
self direction,nothing,"I thought it would be fun to play this game, but couldn't figure out how & wish I hadn't bothered."
self direction,Second Review,"This has a lot of action. I love Ã°???that I can move around, it keeps me very into the game. Ã°???Ã°???Ã°???"
stimulation,Addictive Game!,"I've been playing the game for about a year now and am thoroughly addicted. Other match three games are fun for a while, but then you get to a point where you can't progress without spending money. I do spend money on this game...but you don't HAVE to. I like the different buildings who's games are all different. I LOVE the daily tasks! My only gripe it's that the chargers are so hard to collect. There is something to challenge just about anyone...between the daily tasks, the story books, the mini games, etc. Great game!"
self direction,they want too much private info.,not what I thought it was Uninstalled.
stimulation,My  Favorite Game,"Fun to play, lots of different challenges!"
stimulation,match 3 game,"this is a fun game, always a challenge, very entertaining"
stimulation,Enjoy playing this game,"I have enjoyed playing this game. I do wish that I could play it on my lap top, but it is not available to play on it. I would like to be able to go further in each challenge, but to do that one must buy energy in order to continue if you don't want to wait for it to build up.I am not paying any money just to play a game, so this is why I did not give 5 stars. I like the game but the asking to pay for energy etc. in order to continue I feel is wrong. There should be a way that one can do something to earn more energy points instead of paying money for it.I would recommend the game to others."
stimulation,Fun,Fun way to play an adventure game in a match three format.
stimulation,Challenging game,"Really enjoy this match 3 game that has different challenges and fails to bore. Amazes me the programming that has gone on and contines, great game!"
self direction,Enjoying,"So far I'm really enjoying this game. Some levels are harder than I thought they would be, but it's still enjoyable to play."
self direction,Not what I wanted.,Wasn't what I thought it was. Didn't match the description that was shown.
stimulation,Very Entertaining,Beautiful grafics while the challenges become tougher with each step! Perfecto!!
stimulation,"Fun, challenging, addicting, and not just another puzzle game","This game is both fun and challenging. Once you build up your energy reserves and experience level that allow you to play longer, you will be addicted to this game. I like that it's not yet another square pushing jewel game, but rather it's a combination of tactical and puzzle game. Very interesting, makes you want to play more and search for all the items to continue the village restoration. You never know what you will find, plus daily quests for special prizes, and holiday challenges are fun.Two things that would greatly improve this game is to allow users to purchase gems through Google play rather than having FB as the only option. Also unless you are FB user you won't be able to sync this game across multiple devices."
self direction,Causing sleeplessness??,"I've been playing this game for about 9 months.  Thought it was fun so kept playing.  I refuse to pay actual money for the gems so reading the reviews inspired me to quit this game as the farther along you go, the more you'll need to pay actual money to continue.  But my biggest concern is my inability to shut down my brain when I go to bed.  I see the moves jumping around in my head and have a really hard time falling asleep.  I bought blue-light reducing glasses to help with this problem but didn't appear to help much.  So I decided to quit playing the game.  It's been about 2 weeks now that I haven't played the game, and I am finally able to fall asleep the way I used to prior to playing this game.  I'm wondering if it's all similar games and not just Cradle of Empires.  Anyone else having this problem?  My sleep is more important than playing a game so no more games for me.  I'm going to go to the library and loan out actual books instead."
stimulation,Lots of variety to the puzzles,"I like the variety of the puzzles. You can pretty much relax and play the game however you want, regarding if you want to actively build up the city and get new puzzles or not. I find it rather relaxing (except for the timed puzzles). It did take me awhile to build the ship, but I admit I wasn't trying very hard. There are different events that happen where you can spend your resources to play instead of energy. I've never been able to actually complete an event yet, but they are a nice diversion. I actually like having a limit on my energy, or I might spend more time playing the game and not getting anything done in real life! It can be a challenge with a bit of luck involved with how the pieces dropped, but it's not as difficult as Homescapes and overall much more enjoyable!"
stimulation,Cradle of Empires,Graphics are good. Game is fun with some variety and  challenge. This game is addictiveThe cost of of the energy is high. That is why I can't give it five stars.
stimulation,Not very exciting,It was a bit boring. Not a lot of real excitement to it. Sorry
stimulation,Fun,Just started playing. Fun with some interesting challenges.
stimulation,Watch out for touch screen mistakes!,"I have played the PC predecessors of this game and am familiar with the various challenges/roadblocks than many people whine about. I'm at level 29 and have spent nothing. My complaint or caution is that sometimes my moves are misread and my choice is ignored ...moves on the far side of the screen occur that I didn't choose to make. This frequently causes a loss of the level I am playing. Game updates have improved but not eliminated the problem. When you are playing a timed level, this can REALLY be a source of anger and frustration!"
stimulation,Challenging,Love this game!  It keeps me entertained and it's not boring. It's a challenge.  Love all the side games that are included in this game.  Thanks for making it fun!!!
stimulation,Enjoyable,I like the game offers a challenge and extra side games nice
stimulation,Very Entertaining & Addictive,"Love the concept, the story, and the different challenges."
stimulation,frustrating......,"I've played role adventures before, but this one goes nowhere."
stimulation,Match 3,So far this match 3 quest game delivers nice little challenges without being tedious or frustrating.
self direction,I really love this game,I can't seem to keep up with the action games .  This is great .  I found out that I'm good at matching threes.
stimulation,Challenging,Great game. Gets harder as you progress. Lots of fun levels. Variety of different challenges in March 3 puzzles.
self direction,Didn't care for it.,I don't care for this game. I would not order it . I do not recommend this to anyone. It's my thought. Maybe some one else would like it. I don't. Thanks. Kathy
self direction,Game,Wasn't what I thought it would be.
stimulation,It's more of an adult game match 3 than children and I enjoy it for hours,Once I start playing this game it's hard to stop. The game challenges you in a way that gets you to challenge yourself. It's more of an adult game match 3 than children and I enjoy it for hours!
stimulation,Awesome Game!,Terrific game with a lot of levels and challenges!
self direction,Great match 3 game!,great scenery  and story. I thought it would be hard but it is relaxing!
self direction,Fun but too expensive!,"I thought you would babe ""purchasing"" the gems you need with the coins you earned solving puzzles.  No the coins come from your wallet.  I've bought my last. When I run out the game will be deleted."
stimulation,Fun game to play.,Good graphics and fun holiday challenges
self direction,Thought it was just going to be like a jewel blitz type game,"Thought it was just going to be like a jewel blitz type game.. I was bored with all the other side stuff, like build a village, go back to the shop, buy a hoe for the garden, etc.  No sooner had I downloaded (thinking it was something else) I un-installed it.  Just not for me."
self direction,Fun game,"I like the game, but it is a micro-transaction game. If you want to progress quickly, you will need to pay money. I am not opposed to paying now and then. I have not run into a situation where progressing required a cash outlay. I have, however, only played for a day or so."
stimulation,"The challenges you can resolve.  If something doesnÃ¢??t work, try something else.",I enjoy the challenges this game gives me.  There are so many different ways to play and You do not have time to get bored with it. You are challenged in so many ways and it is a delight to see what works and what doesnÃ¢??t.
stimulation,Fun but hard game.,This game challenges my mind. One of the best games I've ever play.
stimulation,ok,"Like the app and the different challenges (night vision, blocks) but the pauses between screens gets annoying."
stimulation,New and Different,"I have really enjoyed this game, this is a nice change of pace with match 3, building, and adventure in one game. The main problem is running out of energy after completing a few levels and you having to purchase the resources if you  want to continue on. That's the main reason for not rating it higher."
stimulation,Challenging game.,Great game.  Full of challenges.  Love it.
self direction,good Match 3 game,Good variation of boards and bonuses.  Well thought-out &#34;story&#34;.
stimulation,game,Multiple levels of challenges. Sometimes options are confusing.
stimulation,Love this game!,Lots of fun! Great combo of matching  game with building and adventure game. Nice music and graphics. Fun for everyone!
stimulation,Challenging but fun,"It starts simply, then the challenges get harder. its a nice little matching game. no money required."
universalism,Great graphics,"I really like this game. But I played for days without understanding the rules. The graphics are beautiful but I don't think the price for gems is fair, and I had 82 points left and they didn't carry over . I paid extra for them too"
self direction,It's okay!,"I didn't think that I had to build thing's in this game , I just thought it was just a matching game! So the game is ok!!"
universalism,Small annoyances that add up to big aggravation,"Let me preface this by saying that there's a lot this game gets right.  Graphics are gorgeous, sound is very good, concept is intriguing, and the story is meaty without being overdone.But the aggravation in CoE is greater than the sum of its minor annoyances.First up, it's Match 3, and so there are times when you're going to be left with squares near the top of the board that can only be matched with a lucky drop.  By itself, it's a minor annoyance, but that's the nature of Match 3.But then, after you pass the level, there's a chance you may not even find the object you're questing for.  You read that right:  even if you DO get past a level, you may still come away empty-handed.  True, you'll always get SOMETHING after a completed level; but whether or not that ""something"" is of any actual value, well...An example:  I'm looking for one specific charger that I need to finish a main story quest.  I've been searching where the game sends me for TWO DAYS at this point, and that ONE little item that I need, just flat-out REFUSES.  TO.  SHOW.  UP.  Again, by itself, it's a minor annoyance; low drop rates for quest items aren't unheard of.  But a low drop rate for quest items on the back end, after I've already had to deal with enough of a luckfest in the upfront game, adds up the annoyance in a hurry.But the topper is that it's energy-based, and you can only make so many attempts before having enough energy to take another atttempt.  This one item I'm looking for, is in an area that takes 11 energy; at three minutes per energy unit, that means a 33-minute cooldown if I run out.  By itself, it's a minor annoyance; energy meters are almost a fact of life in high-end FTP's.  But when you add it to the other two...Let me put this as succinctly as I can.  By itself, I have no issue with losing a Match 3 level to an unlucky late-stage drop.  By itself, I understand quest items can be hard to find.  By itself, I get that energy meters are the price of FTP gaming.Where I take issue, is having to wait half an hour or more, to play the same area for the twentieth time, hoping that I don't get jobbed by an unlucky drop at the end of the level, in order to, MAYBE, find a quest item that may not even show up.Individually, those are all minor annoyances.  In combination, though, the whole of the aggravation is much worse than the sum of the minorly annoying parts."
stimulation,Patience equals success,"As a puzzle game I do like Cradle of Empire however, it will take a while to accomplish most of your goals. Some of the collections seem to take forever to get because certain items are not only very hard to find but also some of the items you finally find may be needed for multiple collections and that can be very frustrating.  This game is certainly a challenge and will take you quite a long time to finish unless you are willing to spend actual money on in-game purchases to speed thing up."
stimulation,Great game,Enjoyable game to challenge your mind and hold your interest
self direction,Be Very Careful and watch your spending on this one,"This is the  first march 3 building empire game I have played.  The way you can really run your cost up is by buying a few.more moves in an almost completed match 3.  Unless you see the one more move, DO NOT CONTINUE A LOST GAME.  That is really expensive.  You will need to purchase some jewels when you start.  Bide your time.  On the fifth day in a row, the prices come down some.  Spend yr money then.  This is really enjoyable with great match 3 play, and a lot of ways to progress.  But, you lose energy awfully fast.  Do not spend more than you are willing to spend on this game as a whole.  That is why I rated it 4 stars.  It can get very pricey just because you would like to play a little longer.  The game is well thought out.  The graphics are very good.  The play is very interesting.  However, for a newbie, I had/have little understanding of the use of the spells you gradually acquire.  Their explanations of things generally slowly solidify, so that may become clearer later.  The way they get you playing in the game grabbed my interest quickly.  Sorry I cannot compare it to other similar games.H.Scott"
self direction,More complex...,...than I thought it would be. Lots of things to see and do. I don't see myself getting bored with this one anytime soon.
stimulation,FUN AND CHALLENGING,THE MANY WORDS AND CHALLENGES THROUG OUT THE GAME
stimulation,Like it,Fun. Lots of challenges. I even downloaded on two devices.
stimulation,Lots of reading and puzzles,This game is a matching with a story line to follow.  You can skip reading by going to next challenge.  Fun.
stimulation,Neat game,This is a great game .  I like all of the different levels.  I also like all of  the different challenges.
self direction,Annoying,"I couldn't uninstall fast enough.  The artwork - though decent - makes the actual game-play tiny and challenging to see.  Also, you can't skip dialogue/story, which pops up before every ""challenge"".  Nor can you skip demonstrations for EASY/OBVIOUS levels.  Not at all what I expected or hoped for, based on the preview.  Too bad, because I thought it had potential for a ""brain exercise break"" game, but it was a huge disappointment and waste of a download -- even though it's free."
stimulation,Screen getting way too crowded,"Very creative and entertaining. Good variety of challenges, but too many timed games--stressful!Lots of updates, but each one brings more unnecessary icons crowding the screen and reducing the size of the playing field.And make the super-irritating piggy bank an optional game like the others."
self direction,pretty fun,I like the interaction and puzzles. I wish the energy regenerated faster though.
self direction,Adventurous story game,Fun game. It is like exploring a story through matching three. I like all the different area levels to explore as I play and the many different artifacts found and tools needed along the way.I do not like the Facebook presence!
stimulation,Highly addicting and entertaining,"This game has become so addicting for me that I have uninstallled all but 1 of my other games. New levels keep me entertained and challenged and unlike many other games that I like, I have not found the levels to become so challenging that I get frustrated and end up feeling like they are unsolvable."
self direction,Enjoyable Game,Played this game before and wasn't very happy with it. I thought I would try it again which I'm glad I did. It appears to have been updated and is much more enjoyable.
power,Sounds are irritating,"They keep adding the most annoying sounds and there is no in-app sound control to turn it down, just off for this game. I used to enjoy playing, but can hardly stand the noise now!"
self direction,Fun Puzzle,"The ability to build up different areas provides ongoing interest.  The customer support is quick and informative.  Drawbacks are few at this point (i am fairly new to the game), mostly pop-up error messages that make little sense, you will need to purchase items if you want to go far,and interaction with other players needs work."
self direction,Purchases Disappear,"Although the game is fun, beware of this developer! First, I tried to purchase ""jewels"" in order to extend my play and ended up spending over $ 20 because the purchases were never confirmed so I believed they didn't go through.  That left me with 350 jewels to play. When I stopped the game, I had over 300 left.  The next day, that number was 15. I thought I was mistaken about the number so  I purchased a ""package"" that included at least 60 jewels before I shut the game down thinking I would play today.  When I opened the game, there were only 5 jewels remaining and that's because of the daily ""bonus"" of 5 jewels.  This game is a money trap.  I have learned my lesson and will not download any other games from this developer!!"
stimulation,Cradle Rocks!,P!aying for 1 years. Love it. Can get frustrating but then it wouldn't be a challenge.
stimulation,Challenging,Doesn't always tell you how to use things and how to win the challenge.
stimulation,Lots of fun,"Enjoying this game, like the challenges, fast pace."
stimulation,Interesting but frustrating,"The story and different tasks are interesting, but it can be very frustrating. Clearing all the tiles in a level is a nice challenge, but trying to figure out why you can clear all the tiles, but still not pass a level is maddening.Retaking the level, may or may not make it clear what else can be done to improve your score.I wish it were possible to purchase the game outright, as opposed to ""buying crystals"" to complete challenges."
stimulation,"Fun, but....","Fun game, but some challenges are really difficult. Energy drains too fast. Takes forever to get sets completed. Prize wheel is nice, but never lands on the good stuff. Fun, but getting a little frustrated."
self direction,give it a chance,"first of all, i got this game through the google store and have been playing it on my samsung galaxy tab 4.  since my tablet recently stopped working i am looking into getting an amazon fire and wanted to make sure i could get this game on it.  i have read some of the reviews posted here and thought i would add my two cents.  yes you have to play some rounds several times before getting the items you need to complete the collection.  yes it can be frustrating and several times i have put the game aside before returning to it.  but no, you do not need to buy anything.  i don't have the money to buy game add ins yet i have found many items, have several buildings, am up to level 48 and several of my buildings are upgraded.  not once have i bought anything,  give this game a chance it may not be an easy one put it is fun."
stimulation,Fun,Challenges are good
stimulation,fun but frustating,"I very much enjoy this game because I have been able to learn while playing, it is challenging, the graphics are beautiful.  HOWEVER, it is also extremely frustating.  I have 2 collections I cannot complete and have been trying for almost three weeks to get the missing chargers.  Even when I manage to complete a challenging level, I get a couple of energy points, nothing substantial.  Seriously annoying.  Oh, and by the way, if you are giving energy points as prizes, considering how quickly energy is used up (as noted in numerous comments here) you could at least make it a larger number.  I also find it very annoying that when I am stuck and unable to clear any of the current quests, no more are made available.  In one of my other games, quests are added regularly, allowing me to go to something new and come back to the older quests.  This would help eliminate the frustration of trying the same game over and over again.  As I have a limited income, I am not free to spend money on crystals which makes it extremely difficult to make any progress.  I will continue playing as I do enjoy the game and the challenges, but I don't know how much longer, due to the high frustration level"
self direction,Great game,I'm really enjoying this game. I thought I would play it not like it and install it. Well I was very wrong. It's 1:22 in the morning and I think I've been playing it for over an hour. I plan on still playing it until at least 3 in the morning.Thank youCarrie reilly
stimulation,Ripoff,"I expect the game to be a challenge, but not a virtual impossibility without spending a boatload of REAL money. Typical company ripping off the little guy. Unless you're a professional gamer, you won't get far without spending the cash."
stimulation,Great time waster,"Fun, advancing challenges and quests to keep you coming back"
stimulation,Enjoyable but Frustrating,"I really like this match 3 game, but I find it frustrating in that you just get to playing and you run out of energy to proceed forward unless you either wait until time fills up the energy meter or you give up and buy, with your money, more resources with which to continue the game! The puzzles are fun and evolve in complexity and new challenges as the game progresses. It is a well constructed game."
power,Unauthorized purchase,I did not authorize this purchase some how my parental control password came off!
power,DonÃ¢??t waste your money!!!!!!,"So my 4 yr old bought this game without my knowledge Ã°?Â¤Â¦Ã°?ÂÂ¼Ã¢?ÂÃ¢??Ã¯Â¸Â Bad mom for forgetting to setup the parental controls on his new tablet! Anywho, this game is crap! It lags so bad that itÃ¢??s not even worth playing!!!! I wish I could just get my $14.99 back Ã°??? If I could give it zero stars I would!"
power,Lol,OK so I got this game for free and it wasn't good or bad enough I like the graphics but not the controls 50=50
power,This is a scam!,I'm surprised this is allowed on the appstore.  It looks like it was built in Unity with the out of box car controller in about 10 minutes. Vehicle tires are half way through the pavement.  Other vehicles are halfway through the pavement entirely.  You shouldn't have to purchase coins to upgrade vehicles for something you paid $15 for.
self direction,Terrible game high priced game,"My son downloaded on accident for 14.99!!! I was already mad when I saw the transaction, but then I thought, well let me see what it is all about. It is horrible! Controls don't work well, terrible graphics, not a simulation at all! Ã°??Â©Ã°??Â©Ã°??Â©  2 thumbs down!!! Ã°???Ã°???"
power,Parental controls to avoid this happen to you,"My kid clicked on it to read about it, then it downloaded without my permission and charged me $14.88 without my knowledge. It's almost a SCAM. I don't recommend it, and make sure to put parental controls to avoid this happen to you."
power,Loophole that bypasses parental PIN for purchase?,My 4 year old somehow purchased this game even though parental purchase controls were in place. I'm not sure how/why this game is still allowed in the appstore as it seems this is a fairly common complaint.
self direction,Entertaining,"I recently tried this app & found it to be very fun. I thought the daily ticket reward for logging in was a good idea. Unfortunately after a week the rewards stopped, apparently to choose another book tickets must be purchased. I enjoyed the app though and the story I chose was well written. I preferred the mystery genre. Downside is I can get through many short stories in a short time, not cost effective. Plus there are not enough choices at this time. Another nice idea is the opportunity for writers to submit stories for consideration. Overall worth keeping an eye on see how things develop."
self direction,It stopped...,"Chapters:Interactive Stories stopped  in mid story. I guess I had to pay or something but, these stories to do it this way when you are half through the story then you have to pay. I thought you had to pay according to the different choice paths that you make and one choice may be free of which is a default choice. I liked the story line but, I wished I could've completed the whole story before it stopped working..."
stimulation,Lots of money,"I am all about paying for a good book but when you have to pay throughout, you start paying more then you would for a paperback.  I love the idea of adult choose your own adventure stories and the story itself was great but I really didn't want to pay that much."
self direction,Basically just a book with pictures,"Not as interactive as I thought it would q, but the graphic are great"
stimulation,Great fun game,This is a great game. It's like the cigar your own adventure books. Really fun to see how it turns out.
self direction,REQUIRED micro-transactions ruin an otherwise interesting and fun game. Only for the wealthy,"I've read ALL of the reviews posted on or before 5-10 -19. Often it s seems for Chapters Interactive Stories, the main difference between most of the positive vs. negative reviews is based on the author's ability and/or willingness to spend money on countless micro -transactions to influence the stories. One person wrote that she'd spent $80 during one story. My personal feelings of micro-transactions aside, it's fine if individuals who can afford such things want to spend their money on a suit of armor or a ball gown for character's whose stories have a finite lifespan of 20 chapters, but what many people probably don't realize is even if you don't purchase diamonds or gems depending on the story your engaged with, eventually you'll have to buy the chapters just to finish a story. As soon as I completed chapter 7 and was told it would cost $2.99 for the next chapter, I realized this game wasn't for me and I deleted it."
self direction,Good,There needs to be more interactions and free too
self direction,Meh..,Really I though there would be more.I thought I would see move ment but just Ã°???reading but it is a pretty alsome Ã°??Â®gameÃ°???
stimulation,Not for kids,"I searched choose you own adventure games for tweens. This popped up. I looked at it first before allowing my daughter to play. The covers of the books or ""chapters"" are basically somewhere between romance novels and soft porn."
self direction,Great stories,Great story app I re read the one book twice I wanted to see if it had any different story lines or actions to it I read the book in one day even though I had to wait for more tickets I waited patiently lol this does have adult content I would say 21 age group Ã°???
power,Wow!!!,So addictive! Love the stories!! Would love more tickets to view the chapters you only get 1 every 30 mins and max out at 2 a time. Unless u purchase more.  Some books leave u hanging? Big climax to the story then fizzles out and you have no good ending and u look for more chapters but that's it.. Would love more diamonds to control the stories of at least generate them faster ..Would give this app a 10 Ã°??? of had more tickets and diamonds more frequently!!!
self direction,Interesting app,I like this a lot more than I thought I would.
self direction,Not so good without cash,"I was a little disappointed that you have to take less desirable actions because they must be purchased with the in-app diamonds.  You start out with none and they immediately start telling you to buy some.  Stuff like this should only happen to make you keep going when your turn is over.  Otherwise, it is really cute and fun."
self direction,Mature content - NOT for kids!,"This is mature content!  I mistakenly got this app for my daughter, thinking by the app name that it was some sort of a choose-your-own-adventure reading activity.  Well, I guess it is, but not the kind I thought.  She never got to play it because I nixed it as soon as I realized.  Not for kids!"
power,"No diamonds, forever to refill lives",Ridiculous! Every time you complete a book you should get diamonds but you dont. You also have very little control over the stories because all good choices have to.be bought with diamonds. Also the amount of time it takes to refill lives is stupid.....3 hours for.2 lives! Deleting this game now
self direction,Beware if you are getting this for your pre-teens,"At first, I thought this was a great way to get my 10 year old to read, but these ""chapters"" are laden with adult content that should be available for only 18. Buyer beware"
self direction,Off to a less than stellar start,"I understand that making the player's character's expression is hard. BUT if you can do 4 different hairstyles, then you can have a character the player plays as WITH A LITTLE MORE COLOR. As a poc it's a bit discomforting choose between white girl with blonde hair versus brunette hair as my main character.Not only that but as a brand new player in order to get the first premium options (white girls with ""fancy"" hair) you need 17 diamonds each. When starting 1 story the very first option you have is choosing the looks of your players. You earn diamonds by completing chapters (1 per complete chapter). So if i wanted to have white girl with ""fancy"" hair, I will have had to complete 17 chapters. But the about if tickets given to new players is 5. (Tickets are used to unlock story chapters 1 ticket per chapter.) So these Premium options are ENTIRELY USELESS UNLESS YOU STRAIGHT IF THE BACK BY DIAMONDS. There should be a starter amount of diamonds or some other way to EARN THEM without taking a thousand years. Or have the initial premium items more diamond affordable.That way the player can pick and choose what options they can want to plurge on. For example, I am more interested in the back story than just cursing my boss out so buying the premium backstory then would enrich my game experience and I'd just save my diamonds by not choosing the option of cursing by boss out.

If you spend money you can advance to levels that make others cower in fear from your presence...  But, if you can't afford to be that all powerful bully, the makers of this game dangle safety options  (like shields) that remain intact allowing you to safely build your resources and military... or so you think...  They give the bullies an option that literally gives them free access to your resources and makes your shields completely worthless...  Basically robbing you of hundreds (or thousands) of real dollars.This game is the worse type of game for honest hardworking folks, but it will cost you real serious money to even stay in the game."
self direction,Great game but loses one star for being overpriced,"Great game but loses one star for being overpriced. The packages are full and in themselves may be a good value but smaller transactions should be available as well.  The gold store should let players buy what they need and shop and not have to buy packages with loaded with stuff they don't want or need.With that said, the game play is engaging and addicting. Battle with AI and PvP, collect resources, build up your base and army, make alliances, and craft resources into more effective and powerful tools to aid you in your conquest of the state."

self direction,"Terrible company, often you will not get what is advertised with in-app purchases, one email per day per issue","I wish we could give negative stars. Frustrating frustrating frustrating, did I mention frustrating, zero customer service.Pros:Could be fun if it worked right and you got your money 's worthCons:1. The game never works right. Also if you think you are playing for free, forget about it, this game is not fun at all unless you spend money, otherwise you are constantly losing battles. Been there tried that, not fun at all.2. 80% of the time you don't get what you paid for. Example, you buy a pack that is $99 and comes with few different types of of upgrade, lets call them A, B and C. So you paid $99 to get upgrade A, upgrade B, Upgrade C. Fantastic you are all happy now to use the upgrade and make your moves, 1 problem, for some reason when you go to apply upgrade C, you get an error. Ok contact customer service right? Read #33. Contacting customer service = you send an email for help, you immediately get a programed response saying their team is viewing your claim, then you wait 24 to 48 hours for response. When they do respond it is always the same:A. If your issues is the game giving you an error or something not working right, then you are told ""programmers are aware and are working on it. (sure, I have been waiting for over a year for the programmers to fix my errors and nothing, meanwhile they have my money for the issue that is not working)B. If your issue is you didn't get the correct amount of something then they will keep incorrectly telling you that you are the one that is mistaken and you did get the correct amount,  even tho after the first 3 times you have learned your lesson and this time you have screen shots as proof.(see my first picture about credits, at the bottom you see link for 6 screnshots as proof, still didn't get my 3 million  credits till this day, now it is obsolete)4. One email per day. After waiting 24 to 48 hours (mostly 48 or longer) you get a response back from  customer service if you are lucky, and you respond, you now have to wait 24 hours for a response, in short your communication is limited to one email per day making every issue a week long project.5. Don't expect them to read your emails, example last week I like an idiot decided to come back to this game, paid for upgrade pack, part of it was something called ""instant multiple research"". What this does is allows you to upgrade bunch of categories with one click instead of literally 100s of clicks. Emailed customer service complaining about ""instant multiple research"" not working, 2 days later got a response saying we understand you have an issue with ""alliance gifts"" we are working on it. Now ""alliance gifts"" have nothing to do with ""instant multiple research"" so obviously they didn't read my email at all.That is like you call AT&T to complain about your ""cellphone service"" and they say: we understand you are having an issue with your"" tivo box"" and we are working on it.That was last week, replied to them saying their response had nothing to do with my issue, you want to know what their response is?I will let you know when they respond because 7 days and 5 emails later, I have 0 response to report to you. This is Machine Zone's idea of customer service.6. No way to contact this company other than the process above, which basically means no way of contacting this company. Mobile Strike, gods of War and a couple of other games are owned by machine zone.STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME / COMPANY, THEIR FINE PRINT SAYS YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS AND THEY ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO HAVE THE GAME WORKING PROPERLY OR OWE YOU ANYTHING AT ALL WHETHER ITS THE GAME WORKING  CORRECTLY, YOU GETTING WHAT YOU PAID FOR IN-APP PURCHASES.

stimulation,you CAN safely enjoy this game and play for challenges without spending too ...,"First and foremost, this game is absolutely a ""money-suck"". Most of the reviews stating this are true 100%. However, you CAN safely enjoy this game and play for challenges without spending too much money. Now how much is that? I would say under $200. Again, that is still A LOT of money to drop on a mobile app game and there are certainly better games out there that you can play for much less. But as long as you can get into a new state, power up rather quickly, and join a leading alliance, there will be alliance gifts from other spenders that will provide the necessary gold to remain shielded most of the time. If you pick your packs right, that gold will last you a long time. Have fun!"

stimulation,"Takes time and effort, but definitely not pay to win!","First off this is not a game you can play once or twice a week and expect to do well in. This game is actually very good. Don't be scared off by those saying this is pay to play. Sure there are those that spend big and unless you want to spend big you won't compete with them. However, if you get in a great alliance, complete challenges and actually put time and effort into the game  you can compete with most players. There are ways to protect your troops and resources so you don't have to worry about starting from scratch. Stay on top of it and you will prosper. This saying this is pay to play just don't want to have to actually work at a game and expect to be the best right away."

This game is free to download but not to play as you will find that in order to even enjoy a slight competition you will have to spend money and lots of it.
self direction,You don't get enough time to decide if you like it before you are asked to invest heavily,"Mobile Strike could be a fun and addicting game, if the developers had placed game play ahead of profiteering.  Before you can get emotionally hooked into the ""story line"" (if there is one), and real action, you are confronted too soon with having to make purchases.  You can decide to play the game for 30 seconds per day, which does not build game loyalty or desire to come back and play, or you can spend money.It really becomes a choice. Which games will you choose to invest in.  I did not choose this one.  I have my games that I invest in. this one does not give me reason to switch.Will it give you enough reason?  I don't know.  I don't think the developers give you enough time to figure that out."
stimulation,"This is actually a very fun game, you make friends","This is actually a very fun game, you make friends, work together, learn new game related things together, compete, etc.  HOWEVER, it is a cash cow.  Lately, it has become a super cash cow.  Mobile Strike and EW are offering new things, items, researches, challenges, gear, sales (yes thats what they are called) but even if you buy, you are not given ample time to use, learn to use, or even try out, before they come up with something else.  Losing all desire to play, as they are making sure it's no longer fun for those of us who have played it for a while.Just an observation, as the more experienced players are maxed, close to maxing out, MS and EW guess, getting rid of them or making them bored with non gaming things, the newer players will want to spend more.Good thing I have grown, have bought,and have played at my leisure.  May just be time to play Candy Land."

I have had burning in my base because reboots, or game glitches, at times of battle where I am attacking and getting attacked then the game resets/ or reboots. Leaving my base venerable to further attacks and no way to control or limit this problem. You can't shield, or change to defensive gear when you aren't connected. Then you contact customer support and their generic response is:our team is working on these issues, we should have a resolution soon.OK, so what does that fix for me, HERE AND NOW?

But don't work what u buy today will be out of date tomorrow.Even if u ""load"" your packs so they are cheaper it's still expensive to play.  So if u just starting out, quit the game now."
power,Play this if you have an unlimited disposable income stream.,"I am writing this review so that others can make see what my experience with the game was and then make their own decision. I downloaded this to get a ""reward"" from another game that I played. I was hooked in the first day and saw that the max base or headquarters level was level 30 in June of 2017. It is now October and the max HQ level is 250 if I recall correctly.I want to be the best and be able to conquer the game so I made my first purchase, I was promised an HQ level of ""X"", a commander level of ""X"", and completed research levels of ""X"". After my purchase I was not able to complete the items as stated in the ""sale"". I contacted the developer and after 10 emails I was able to straighten out my issue.This cycle continued until I stopped playing in August of 2017. What I found was that once I made it to a certain point, that for another mere $100 I could level up to another point and so on. I found that it is a never ending cycle.I spent a huge chunk of money on the game and found that, if you did not purchase the newest package your base, troops, research, etc. was obsolete. The newer base, troops, research, etc. always ""destroyed"" the last package release.When I started playing the items were consistent and everyone was ""maxed"" out. Epic war, LLC. is releasing new items every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturdays currently. If you are NOT buying the latest and greatest you cannot ""safely"" accomplish the goals of the game which are to destroy other bases and hold control points.They (EW) come out with a Ã¢??newÃ¢?Â sale every few days that always state guaranteed Ã¢??maxÃ¢?Â. If it was Guaranteed Ã¢??maxÃ¢?Â then it should Ã¢??stopÃ¢?Â at that point and not continue to increase. The HQ was a max of 30, then 40, then 100, then 200, now 250. The commander, VIP, troops, research, each have levels as well. While one package may ""max"" out say your commander, you need another once to max out your VIP, or HQ, etc.The game depreciates faster than buying a new car, for example when they release something on Tuesday, it comes with say 100 items for $100 and you need 1,000 of those items to ""max"" out your base. Then when the new items come Thursday (or sometimes they come Tuesday night or Wednesday morning) they include the 1,000 items for $20-$80. Keep in mind that even though it includes the full 1,000 items for what you needed on Tuesday, it now needs 1,000 different items for another ""upgrade"" but it only comes with 100 of those items.There are constant glitches in the game that donÃ¢??t allow the game to play properly. Also you are constantly missing items after the Ã¢??purchaseÃ¢?Â. It generally takes three or more emails to the developer before they attempt to fix the issue. It takes another three to four emails after that before you have the items completed.The numbering and amount of items required went from you need 1,000 of this, to you need 1TT (TT= Septillion, yes it's a real number) of that same item to ""level"" it up. Currently (10-16-17) there are people with a power level of 1KTTT (Sedecillion), which require you to have an unreal amount of troops.If you choose to spend money on this game do some research, there are many ways to save money when buying packs, but as I said you need an Unlimited disposable income stream to play this game.I am happy to spend Ã¢??someÃ¢?Â money to play a game that I can enjoy and I would be happy to also pay to see the game progress, however when the game progresses three times a week it is theft and a scam.Good luck to you."

self direction,Great for fans of mmorpg,"The great heyday of mmorpg in mobile OS was '08 - '13. That does not mean those games aren't around anymore but new offers & participation have been stagnant in the last few years after a massive contraction. - That said, you'll like this game if you are into mmorpg and you won't be deceived by the ads with Arnold. It is one of the best games of its kind out there at the moment. Word of caution though: Success will only follow IF you will join one of the leading alliances with a high gift level (above 15) AND you are prepared to spend some $$ eventually ($5 - $100). After four months you will reach lvl 21 (of 30) and game play will become expensive because you will have to buy packages a lot more often. From the makers of Engine Age's ""Game Of War - Fire Age"", this one runs on the same engine and the devs (EW called here) are experienced and they've learned their lessons from other failed mmorpg type games; glitches are kept mostly under control and cheating (i.e. through script hacking) is not allowed. Devs have recently disallowed play on older devices with OS from before '15. They actually DO enforce their TOS. - Expect to put in anywhere between 15 minutes to upwards of an hour per day and account. Happy gaming."

The game get boring after a while.2. There is no animations of your units fighting the enemy which turns down your excitement of taking down an enemy.3. This game is so terrible that almost all the bases around you are abandoned YES I said it there are a lot of abandoned bases which obviously mean that the game is bad.4. Some of the guilds in this game are not even active anymore I went In to a guild and I wasn't for a month and I came back and the boss didn't kick me out so I mail him to say hi and he didn't respond which means it's completely abandoned.5. Yes there are bullies in this game so watch out for them.Should you get the game? Absolutely noHere are my reasons why this game is bad I mean shoot even Invasion: New frontier is better even though the developers stop updating it. And obviously the game is just a rip off of Game of War don't get the game it's just not fun. I rate 2 stars for graphics and updates.

self direction,Strangely addicting. You will either love it or hate it. Find an alliance you enjoy being in because that will make a difference,"Strangely addicting. This game combines the growing of a sim-like-city with the action of armies fighting. Join an alliance (you almost have to if you have any hope of realistically growing) and have fun with them. I would say, keep searching for an alliance until you find an alliance that is beneficial to you and your base so you can have fun and grow at the same time.I spend hours a day playing and building up my base and army so I can attack others while I watch Tv or just relax.There are alliances that have spent HUGE amounts of money to upgrade their Headquarters and armies that have an enormous edge on just about everyone not spending hundreds of dollars (if not thousands of dollars). I have my bases in HIMO (#200) and the PurG alliance pretty much does whatever they want, and I believe that other states are the same way (containing aggravating bases with deep pockets that rain havoc on the little guys). I've known a few players quit playing altogether after playing for a few months and getting attacked repeatedly by extremely larger bases and because there is really no recourse whatsoever (without spending hundred or thousands of dollars). This is the extreme suck of the game, but what do you expect, those bases have invested A LOT of money in the game while I have spent very little so they get to do what they want and I have to adapt.I know it sounds pretty bad, but there are a lot of good people playing to make the game really fun and getting attacked is just part of a war game. I would strongly suggest you purchase at least a $4.99 package and a $19.99 package with good gear so you can progress much faster. My 2nd base is approaching the power of my first base because of only those two purchases."

It is probably more suited to kids in the 8-12 age group.He tells me it is fun, and after watching him play it for a couple of hours, he was well (and quietly) entertained.

The first game pack can be purchased for only 4.99, and the next is 19.99...still not too unreasonable...but every one thereafter is a whopping 99.99. Considering how glitchy the software is, and always at the worst possible time, it's definitely not worth it unless you're independently wealthy. There is simply no way to effectively compete unless you're shelling out lots of money.  Game rules and explanations are rudimentary at best, and while there have been obvious attempts to make the game interface as intuitive as possible, it still has a very long way to go. All of this makes for a considerable amount of confusion for new players.  Customer support has generally been timely, but helpful or useful only about half the time. Whether you receive a support agent with a solid working knowledge of the game seems strictly up to chance.  Overall, for the exhorbitant prices being charged, this game needs to work much, much better. A real pity, because it does have some interesting ideas behind it. It's a crying shame they don't simply lower their prices, and try to make up for the difference by doing volume business instead. It would certainly leave far fewer players feeling as though they've been cheated."

universalism,It use to be fun,Started playing this game almost 3 years ago and it was fun especially when you where in an alliance with others because you actually got to know each other as best you when chatting with someone. You would get help from others and try to build but it was always whoever spent the most was the most powerful and out of your league. Yet there was still fun and strategy involved. I would've given it 5 stars about 2 years ago. However about a year ago or more it got to where if you wasn't spending money every week you couldn't even play the game in all honesty unless you wanted to loose everything you played the game to build. Now everything is obsolete like tile collecting and building your own gear. Trying to keep up with everything new that comes out every 3 days or week at most cost you a small fortune and make you study to keep up with what's going on. So even if you do spend money by the end of the week what you spent it to get is now useless and outdated. The game is now ruined and I know many loyal players who finally called it quits. They absolutely ruined this game by wanting to make more and more money. I get the games purpose is for the people who run the app is to make money but not ruin the game in the process. Like another review said do yourself a favor and play something similar where you don't have to spend a small fortune every week unless your rich. However like I said even if you want to do that good luck understanding every new thing each week.

There is no free playing, or even trying to get by with buying smaller packs. You have to spend big to stay competitive. Trust me I have spent thousands on this game and I know many people who have ruined their lives spending all their money on this game. One friend was warned multiple times by his wife and ended up getting divorce papers.  Another spent all his money and could not pay his bills. Long story short he was depressed and drank and drove.. got a DUI, lost his job...was evicted. You will never sell your account for what it is worth or even close. Once you spend that money it is gone and you need to make sure you have the kind of income where you can afford this.  People in my alliance spend $500 a week on packs as there is always new research, troops and building coming out.You need to really make sure you can afford to play this game b4 you download it. Think of it as legal online gambling. The kind where if you forget your shield is coming down and you are zeroed.. all the $$$ you have spent on your base and troops will be erased.  Many people play this game for a month or two invest a couple hundred dollars...are zeroed forgetting about their shield and then quit and are never seen again. There are other games where you can literally get by spending little to no money.... but that is not Mobile StrikeThis game is addicting, please respect my warning."

self direction,You wont get pretty battles or see things blowing up,"It's definitely not for everyone. If you want graphics and animation look elsewhere. What this game does provide is real strategy, base building, diplomacy on a massive scale, and social interaction. Its an alliance based game, so if you plan on playing know you have to play in a team. If you're very competitive, just be warned, you'll need to spend money. You can play without money, but you won't be very influential.Other then that expect layers upon layers of game play that intertwine into a masterpiece of a game (coming for a decades old gamer). This isn't your Clash of Clans or Dominations type of game. You wont get pretty battles or see things blowing up, its a numbers game, and its played mainly by adults. The community is mature, smart, and helpful for the most part.If you are a GOW player, its a chance to start anew, as its the exact same game reskinned in the modern era."
self direction,Not what I expected. Disappointed,"I thought it would be different than it was. My whole army disappeared during an attack and it said that I had troops deployed.

They even have interview type communications to determine if you are good enough to be in the ""group"". Psychologically, it brings out an ugly type of competiveness for those who love to control. ..Kind of like the Napoleon Syndrome. One of the goals is to attack a base 100 times. The sneaky attacker will teleport to their victim. attack... then take off again.  It is almost impossible to get higher then a base of 25 and to try to defend your base is impossible unless you use your peace shields."

WILL become scarce after a whileAll ways work in making your defence higher if so you probably won't be attacked unless you are in a highly populated high rank sectionIf you spawn in kald join the (try1) Bombarders today!Includes a fully awesome action packed Billy action figure like this one below! -Ã°??Â -doesn't exist in real life/|\/\

power,great game,Right now still pretty new so still working on things such as max out at lv10 on V.I.P and waiting for opening of prestige. People are already getting strong from spending cash on game. Can still be competitive but see it becoming like game of war in which billions of power and burn everyone. If don't spend hundreds of dollars in GOW it's not worth playing but this game is at beginning and growing. It is very addicting so now i play Mobile Strike instead of GOW but they are very similar. Hope to be able to enjoy this game for a while but fear big wallets have potential to ruin this game like it did in GOW.

You won't be able to stop spending money as you constantly try to stay powerful. You will waste so much money on Overpriced Gold Purchases and end up losing so much money, just to get destroyed by someone who has spent more money than you. So please, heed my warning.

It's a good concept but no action so it gets dull real fast if you're not willing to dump at least $125 into it. The constant notifications get old quick.

When i first got in the game i thought &#34;this is pretty glichy but so far fun.&#34; And so I just thought that maybe it is just temporary but it isn't. The first time I got in it it shut down then the more played it it kept doing it until I couldn't get InTo it at all. So very glichy and boring the only reason I gave it three not one because I thought it was a good idea
stimulation,Complete lack of enjoyment,"This &#34;game&#34; is a discouraging waste of time. After 3 months of constant grinding I think that it is fair to present this review. Having read multiple reviews from other players I know that my experience is not unique but very common. Each state is governed by the players that cheat the most and spend the most money. The only way to succeed is to spend more money than the other players, or hack the game for items that would cost money. The culminating purpose of the game is to have each state work together to beat out other states in point challenges. However the petty power bullies refuse to allow any smaller players the opportunity to fully engage in the challenges by utterly destroying their base. Wish I never downloaded it. Glad I never spent money on it. Oh, yeah! The big power players try to muscle and intimidate other players into spending money to pay them for protection, like the Mafia. And customer service actually ENDORSES THIS BEHAVIOR!"
self direction,LAGGY,Ok so when I saw this game in the adds I thought It was going to be fun but apparently not the game itself is fun but how do I progress when the game runs at lagg all the time so I can't even movie and froze my entire tablet and I had to restart my tablet can make the game less laggier then I'll rate five stars(by the wayi own a kindle fire hd )
self direction,Turn around and walk away!,"6 months ago I thought it might be possible to play this game in some meaningful way without breaking the bank, but it isn't possible. New updates, gear, research trees, mods, insignia every other day and to obtain them you are going to have to drop at least $99 per pack, and the pack isn't going to contain all that you need, so you're going to need to buy multiple packs. I never thought I would be a top base, but thought I could at least have some fun but the updates have made the concept of a trap base almost impossible and there is word that they are beta testing even more new shield busters to guarantee that lower spending trap bases can play too.On top of the ridiculous costs to be able to unshield and have some fun, this game is seriously flawed. Tons of glitches, pathetic graphics and it crashes all of the time. And, naturally, when they advertise a deal that they later decide was too good and people spend real money and in game currency to attain it, they cancel it without warning and blame one of their ""glitches"" on it. Aside from shady bait and switches, this company also engages in outright false advertising. I have repeatedly seen packs with the title, ""Get More Blueprints!"" that contained zero blueprints, and because of this I have friends who repeatedly bought packs and did not get the level 23 blueprint that you can only buy in packs but is required to level your base past level 22 (current max base level is 30). If you don't plan on spending thousands of dollars, don't play this game. And if you do plan on spending thousands of dollars, you can probably find a much higher quality game that isn't just an over glorified chat room."

self direction,You must be on drugs,"I'm not a game person, but I thought that it could be fun. I thought different about one minute after it downloaded. This isn't a game, it's a lifestyle.

power,"The most well thought out scam, to steal 25$","terrible cheats, first i waisted $600 for absolutly nothing.  i even pushed so many buttons the phone broke, or that was because of their overloads of advertising; either way, games fault for sure, it will drain your battery in 1/2 hour. even brand new iphone 8!  Then within 6months they threw everything out with no compensation! and then had the nerve to try and get you to start over.  I dont see how that was legalÃ‚Â¿  dont touch this scam,  because they have already started over 3 times.  causing players to waist $100's of dollars. the only people on the game are such bullies!  makes you wonder how much of the game they are controlling.  it's a hole of nightmare, you just can't win no matter how much you spend or how accomplished your base is set up."
stimulation,This game is broken and basically abandoned due to the intellectual ineptness of its developers.,"This game is a scam.  I thoroughly enjoyed it in the beginning, but now this is not the product I have been funding at all.  They are placing far too much product in at one time, the game is entirely unbalanced, and before you think that perhaps this is just a rant of an individual that is tired of paying to play, even that functionality does not work properly.  The packs you purchase either via Google, Amazon, or iTunes do not go through half the time making it time out on the challenges, then not to mention the items you receive are pretty much pointless as the coding in this game is so entirely in disarray that the number does not even line up with your attacks.  This game is completely broken now, and I will not be playing, paying, or continuing with any of this nonsense any longer.  Seeking refund as I state prior this is not the game that we all began to play, and now it is a broken mess being allowed to be downloaded by the afore mention providers."
self direction,Mobile Strike is a poor excuse for a game! Money Trap,"Mobile Strike is a poor excuse for a game.  Epic, has clearly established a platform that has enabled a classic scam to satisfy greed. The game is extreamly frustrating. I played this game when it first started and enjoyed it for a couple of months. When I quit the first time I had just completed level 21 and within a few days they came out with level 22.  There is a constant push to spend money to keep your forces at a level to be effective.  Most packs cost $99.  After a year I came back and there now is level 60's. epic offered a catch up pack for $4.99. Not bad I thought. The next pack was $19.00 to bring me to a level 90.  Within 3 weeks they are offering level 125's. the numbers used to track resources are astronomical.  Numbers like Million - Trillion- Trillion- Trillion (MTTT).  Epic constantly is modifying the game, ever increasing the need to purchase new packs to achieve the next level. Once a level is extended they are increasing the newest power levels by factors of 10. By doing that a person with a lower power level does not stand a chance fighting an opponent that is 10 times stronger.  So, the $4.99 catch up offer rapidly turned into $99 packs to keep up.  The current version of the game requires two power steps a week to remain competitive.  I would highly recommend to stay away from this so called game."
stimulation,Ã°??Â¥Ã°??Â¥Don't get this gameÃ°??Â¥Ã°??Â¥,"Graphics and challenges are really good. The game is really complicated and not for younger kids at all. There is a very difficult technique to mastering the game as you rely on buildings, gear and mods that are all based on percentages and numbers. If you join a good alliance, you will learn easily what to do and start rally wars together which is a blast. My biggest complaint however and why I gave it 1 star is this. They claim in all their adds that the game is free. Which could be true except it would take you several years to build your base and gear to even remotely be able to compete in the game. Also, there are a lot of things, including gear that you absolutely can not get without spending money. If you do not spend money then you will not enjoy this game. You can't compete and you spend your entire time farming tiles (which you get attacked on) and you still won't be able to gather enough rss to complete required research, build buildings and train troops.And let's not forget the packs they offer you to buy start at $9.99 just for gold (which gets you nothing) and up to $150 packs which get you a lot. However, the more you progress, it could take upwards of 16-20 packs to complete one research tree. That's $1600-2000 dollars using the average $99 packs they offer. Total rip off for digital info they upload after your purchase. ALSO, You purchase these expensive packs and you don't receive all the items, or they disappear from your inventory when your not looking.  I caution you to not get this game as it is addicting and you will rack up credit card bills before you know it. I know a lot of people that played this game that lost control and went into serious debt. RIP OFF"
self direction,I've played other MMO's and usually enjoy them. Forget about free,"What can I say to prevent you all much pain?  I have NEVER experienced such abuse of customers/players on any game I've ever played.  In truth, I still play, but not for much longer and only because I've invested over $1,500 in this already.  That's right, and it's not an exaggeration.  If you don't want to spend money, you'll get crushed the first time you forget to shield.  If you do spend money, you'll quickly find out that IT IS NEVER ENOUGH!  Mobile Strike comes up with some new ""gotta have"" research, defense or attack mode almost weekly.  So you thought buying those two or three $99.99 packs was going to catch you up?  Not a chance.  Next week, a 450,000% boost is offered.  The monsters of the game (my acct is huge, but I don't qualify as a monster, even being in $1,500) will eat you alive.  I have friends that are in this game over $5,000, and they are struggling to keep up.  My entire game state is talking about quitting.  Mobile Strike's response to numerous requests to at least slow down with the new packs/gadgets...  ""Then just don't play anymore.""  That's right.  Absolutely ZERO concern for their players.Look, I've played other MMO's and usually enjoy them.  Forget about free.  None of them are.  But Mobile Strike takes it to a whole new level.  Think Wall Street bankers are greedy and corrupt?  Give this game a try.  I'll list a few of what I consider abuses to their customers...  -  No disclosure on how much research is needed for each level  -  No responsibility to customer complaints/concerns  -  No ""settle in and catch up"" period for people who do spend a lot of money  -  Outright, obvious and insatiable greed of game creators/owners  -  No forewarning of new packs coming up, so a player who just spent $300, $400 or more doesn't ever know if he/she will be competitive the  following week  -  I could go on and on, but I'll stop here.I hope you took the time to read this.  There are a lot of fun games out there.  Mobile Strike could have been one of them, but it's been ruined.  Please, save yourself a ton of aggravation and money and avoid this game.  Send a message to Mobile Strike and any other MMO out there that it's ok to make money on your game, but don't abuse people.  Thanks for reading...  - Jeff"

Everything you spent Ã‚Â£500 on will be gone!If you manage to keep your shield (base protection) up for that week, the Ã‚Â£500 you spent will be out of date and you will need to reinvest another Ã‚Â£500 to be where you was a week ago because more items will be required to progress further!I have spent over Ã‚Â£4000 (YES FOUR THOUSAND GREAT BRITISH POUNDS) into this game and I am no where near a top player (rally leader) I am only able to fill rallies!However my base and gear is out of date and to get my base upto date (yet still not a top player) I need to invest another Ã‚Â£500 to remain a rally filler! If I wanted to suddenly become a rally leader, I'd need to drop another Ã‚Â£6000/Ã‚Â£8000 into the game at least!!Don't be the next mug to line Mobile Zone aka Epic Wars pockets!!!You have been warned!!AT THE TIME OF WRITING THIS REVIEW, ALL THE TOP PLAYERS FROM ALL THE TEAMS ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGING IN A STRIKE AGAINST THE GAME DEVELOPERS DUE TO THERE MONEY GRABBING WAYS!

The customer service is made up of players who work for packs and very rarely can give you more then a $1-2 value gift as a refund.The response from all tickets is ""I forwarded it onto our developers, we value your opinion"".  Never mind the $10k you waste building your base.  EW and their parent company Machine Zone are con-artists and need to be shut down, full refunds issued to all players in the last 6 months....this company skirts consumer protection laws and needs to be stopped."
self direction,Money pit!! Beware.,"I admit this game sucks you in. If your competitive.. This game is right in your wheel house. If! You have unlimited assess to money.

I could not complete with guys that spend thousands of dollars to get super bases and soldiers and gear. And new gear comes out literally every week that cost money. More than the hundred dollars I put in. So I'm getting zeroed out by these guys. All the research and work I put in to my account. The countless I mean some times eight hours. I'd set timers to remember to do stuff or reset things. All that work wiped out by a guy that spends hundreds of more dollars than me. I got mad and said enough. I can't buy anymore 100 is my max I can't play and be comfortable than to heck with it. Look! They got the ultimate action hero batting for them of course paying him a lot for his promo.. You know some shady dealing is taking place. It's obvious the way they nickel and dime you. I'm not kidding the least bit, download  the game you'll see what I'm talking bout. Remember I said it here people are spending 40k and more and it's still not enough to beat people that spend 100k Im not pulling your leg one bit."
stimulation,THIS GAME REEKS OF SHAMELESS GREED!,"Unlike Hearthstone Heroes of Warcraft, Mobile Strike is about one thing- money. Sure, it's free to download but if you want to get anywhere in the game you're going to have to pay for it and pay big. They've even changed their extreme and basic challenges inside the game from being about how well you can strategize to how much you can spend.The first sale available to you is for $5, the next, $20, next $50, $100 and on. The real shocker, once you make a purchase at any level that dollar amount sales is no longer available to you, for instance, once you buy that $5 sale you can never buy another $5 sale although you Are able to purchase a pittance of gold for each amount level. If it focused more on how to make the game interesting to its players instead of how to get in their wallets Mobile Strike would be worth recommending."
stimulation,Tips for new players,"It is a great strategy game, there are lots of areas to grow and there are always challenges to complete. However, I agree with the 1 star reviewers that if you want to be the BEST you have to spend money. Lots of it. Not even hundreds, I'm talking thousands. SO, if you go in wanting to be a top competitor, then expect that. But if your like me and just want to pass the time by building a base, working through what you can and making friends, then do that, there's definitely enough to keep you busy, but there will be areas of frustration where you'll want to unlock or do something and can't unless you spend money.So if you want to try it out, here are some tips:1. Stay shielded and build your base. If your base shield drops you will be attacked and you will lose resources. I only let mine drop if I want to get in a few attacks, then it goes back up. Don't get too frustrated if you get attacked because that's just part of the game. And you can lose troops on tiles as well so expect that to happen at some point too AND DON'T SEND OUT YOUR COMMANDER.2. Probably spend $5. Work through what you can first, but I've gotten pretty far on $5 as depending on what you get you'll unlock blueprints, a lot of speedups, research files etc. I may end up spending $20 but we'll see. Keep in mind once you spend 5 or 20 the cost of the packages goes up and stays up. After you spend that initial 5 you won't see a $5 one again so choose wisely.3. Time building up your base with challenges when you can. If you complete a challenge (like Build, Research, Train, Repeat) then wait for it to refresh before you start building up again.4. Try to join a large alliance. There are alliance challenges that reward you big for having a lot of alliance members that complete them. Plus you'll stock up on a lot of items by collecting alliance gifts and buying things with loyalty points (which you earn for free) in the alliance store. And if your members are nice they'll help you out with items and resources.5. Collect as many resources, speedups and research files as you can. Even if it seems like you're getting a lot, trust me, you'll need them later. Some research requires billions of resources, a million files and 1000 days to complete so collect what you can.6. Research your butt off and use things like commander armor and mods to give your base some building and research boosts.7. Pay attention to state boosts. These change and sometimes one will pop up that will give you access to research that you didn't have before by providing the first 1000 files or 100% of the time and/or resources.There are lots of other things to mention but these will help you a lot if you decide to try it out. At the end of the day spending money is your choice so if you're prone to getting sucked in and spending too much then I would not recommend this game."
self direction,After the first or even second time spending $100 why not stop there if you didn't like it? BTW,"i will say Phil has a point, however, i disagree with the whole ""lawsuit"" stuff.  He said he purchased the packs; not once; not twice; but 6 separate times.  After the first or even second time spending $100 why not stop there if you didn't like it? BTW, the packs start out low.  4.99, then the second one will cost you 19.99, then i believe 49.99 or 99.99.  I forget.  it's been a while since i purchased a pack last.If you want to play this game do your research.  If you do not feel like doing your research then play some other game.  If you read up and speak to the ""good-guys"" in the game (there are some not so nice players that will not give you good advice; there are kids that play this game as well as adults so expect immature comments in chat) that are with an alliance ask them questions.  you'll probably learn that if you're fortunate to be accepted by an alliance there will be other players willing to help you with advice, resources, and even gold.  Yes, these items are necessary to play the game and get somewhere in it.  I've been playing for SEVERAL months now and the most I have spent on this game is about $150.  i'm sitting at about 1.5 billion power, Level 61 Commander, VIP level 92, over 2million in gold, and billions in resources.  not a bad spot to be to start really getting into the attacks :-)I will also say this: yes, it is a challenging game.  there is SOOOOO much that was thought about when the developers created this game.  They are obviously good at what they do.  I'm STILL learning new things and how to setup my gear, add boosts, etc.  The learning isn't stopping.  Know that this isn't simply a game you open up and it just goes.  If you want to be good at this game you will put in some long hours of playing. It will be a little boring at first but that is only because your base will start out small and you have to build it up from scratch.  That takes time.  Be patient.As far as the failed packs, that has never happened to me so I cannot speak on that.  I'm sorry Phil didn't have fun playing this game.  I'll admit, I've gotten pretty angry at myself a couple time forgetting to refresh my shield and got attacked and cleaned out while i was sleeping.  But you learn and move on.  Now I set alarms on my phone to remind me to reset my shields.  Hahaha! I know that sounds ridiculous, but that is just me.  You certainly do not have to be that serious with it but it helps.I hope anyone who downloads the game enjoys it.  I am."

Customer service has not been much help and I'm now disputing my purchases with both Itunes and possibly my credit card company to see if I have a case.Though in the end I guess I eat it since all sales are so called final however as a paying customer, I'm not getting what I pay for which is quality and stability.  The ideal was to play on a mobile device to give me something to do however I think the lack of maintenance has just destroyed my faith where I question getting sucked in further to any game which requires $$$ to progress.

This has possibly become a case of gross negligence or let the buyer beware.  Just an FYI on what to expect on some devices."
self direction,One Star,Ripoff. Stay away from this game.  Can't believe there isn't a class action law suit against this developer yet.
stimulation,Another negative review,"As others have mentioned, the gold packs are ridiculously weak. If you don't want to spend money don't play this game. If you have thousands to spend on a game that offers nothing for your investment then, be my guest, but don't think you can get over by trying to play without spending thousands of dollars. Imho, it takes at least one pack per level up of your base. The game offers challenges, but the pay outs are even weaker than the gold packs. The amount of rss and gold u spend to reach a goal are100x more than the payouts. If the packs were 5 bucks each it might be doable. $100 a day won't get you to the top at their current price."

But EVERYTHING on the screen is there to make you pay money. Between interstitials and bonus challenges that can only be accessed if you pay money, it leaves a sour taste in your mouth. I LITERALLY spend more time ""x""ing out pay-for pop-ups than progressing my character. It's embarrassing and makes you wonder how much money they paid Arnold that they need to make a crappy money sacking game to recoup it. Stay away"

self direction,Copy of GoW,"Not surprised at what the game consists of. My first thoughts were, &#34;Oh, a new game by MZ, how are they going to suck us bone dry of out money this time?&#34; Well, it's really just what GoW was, but with a military theme. Nothing was changed, it still tries to convince you into throwing your credit card at them, and they STILL have the audacity to call this game &#34;addictive&#34; when, again, it's just GoW with a military theme. MZ wasn't even TRYING to be creative!After you finish the tutorial which, still, is the exact same as GoW's, it shoves a 5$ &#34;offer&#34; for you. Innocent enough. Right? Not really. After that, 5$ changes into 20$, 20$ into 50$, and 50$ into 100$. It really is just a sick copy of GoW. I didn't even kid with myself that I would ever touch one of those &#34;deals&#34;, because I tried to play GoW for a week, I joined an alliance, but since I hadn't bought one of those cheap tricks, people were constantly telling me to &#34;kill youself n00b&#34; or &#34;u suc at this&#34;. I'm only 15 and I'm assuming these people are in their 20s and yet, they're acting like we're on the second grade playground. Same goes with MS. No one has any respect AT ALL.I could really go on and on about MZ and GoW and MS and the next scam MZ will be releasing next week, but really it won't do anything. MZ will continue to treat the players like property, like a juice box they're sucking dry and throwing into the garbage. MZ and everyone working there is pathetic. They probaly have more money than Donald Trump himself, and they're probably living it up in a mansion, showing off their 48 different shades of vintage green race cars, to some girls they found on the street. I think I'm going to stop ranting over MS stupidity, because (unlike the ones who play this game) I have a life."
power,Just barely gave it 4 stars,"I love this game. I wish I could play it all the time. But..... I have some issues with it, too. It lags. And I mean, a LOT. Constant glitching, takes a while to load, and sometimes it will even exit the app. Its so frustrating. Plus, when I'm trying to talk to my alliance, sometimes the keyboard won't show up, and if it does, I'll get one word and the app will glitch again sits that the keyboard doesn't come up. It makes me very sad, because I really do love the game!Money. It always wants money. Now, I don't think this would bug me, but every time I open the app an ad pops up, and the game glitches while its doing this, so I accidentally tap the ad and it messes me up. My screen usually goes gray,  and then the parental controls password pops up (because I'm 11, and I'm not allowed to purchase anything without my parent's  permission). Then when I finally get out of that gray screen, the game lags out of the app.Its sad, because I really do love this game. I just barely gave it four stars, only because I love it, but at the same time it makes me so angry.If you could possibly upgrade it so that other doesn't lag or make ads pop up every five seconds, this would be a complete 5 stars. Please upgrade.I hope this was of use for all who read it!"
power,Waste!,"These games are getting out of control when it comes to in app purchasing.  This is one of them.  It does not let the player play the game without somehow sliding in somewhere on an already crowded screen to use gold/buy gold, VIP Package this, War Crate Package that, buy X-Gold get ""Blah Blah Free"".  It gives me the feeling of playing at a sleezy casino.  The commercials are very misleading.  Combat only makes up a small portion of it.  Have fun upgrading your farm to a level 2, then level 3, then level 4, then you can't upgrade your armory to level 3 because your quarry is not a level 4 yet and so on...  If you have the time to monitor 15 or so tasks that take anywhere from 3:00 to 3 hours each on a daily basis then this game is a great fit for you!"
stimulation,Spend $$$$$$$$,A good game if you have deep pockets.  To be competitive you will need to spend hundreds of dollars..  the only way to win the game challenges is to buy the special packs..  their packs are $99.99. You may get lucky and find one that works for you at $49.99. And once in a blue moon a pack for $19.99. But it won't help unless maybe you get 2.
self direction,Great game to play,"Game could have marines, navy seals, military dogs, snipers, creating your own commander, plus seeing your army attacking the enemy's base and telling them where you want them to go when attacking."
stimulation,Addictive game plagued by unrestricted and possibly psychologically damaged players,"I have the same problem as a lot of other players. I'm willing to dump money into a free-to-play game if it entices me and is fun to play. Good developers deserve that, and at the start the game is addicting to build, employ strategy, and build your alliance. But give it a few days, and somehow you become cannon fodder for long time (or deep pocketed) players that teleport their base to your doorstep, and possibly that of your entire alliance, and hit you with full force before leaving right after (our state #300 COCA). In a matter of seconds, everything you built over the course of a few days goes to the bench for rebuilding or worse.Better yet, the stronger alliances impose restrictions on how you play the game, such as when you are allowed to attack or who can go where. It's like being given a chance to play in a world where a large group of people can play dictator and tell you how you play the game. And if you dare challenge it, they've got players who are on constant alert to take everything you've got. I broke a Non Alliance Pact, someone reported me (seriously) to a higher player (not developer), and I was attacked within 60 seconds. In my gaming experiences, it's one of the most frustrating things to experience when trying to get into a game. Look at the message boards in game and people refer to them as ""bullies"".I know what free-to-play means with these games, and you've got to dump some coin sometimes to get ahead. But with players like these scouting your every move, there's relatively no chance you can really find ways of having fun challenging other players. Unless you came into some serious money or have so much disposable income that you use it to wipe yourself, don't even waste your time getting involved with this game. Unless you're into electronic abuse. Then by all means, dive in and enjoy the taste of your tears.Worst game experience ever..."
self direction,Get your wallet out,"Forget the lies you are told about ""free"".  this game is NOT free.  True, the download is free, but if you want to play the game in any meaningful way, be prepared to spend money, big money.  To the tune of several hundred dollars (or equivalent for foreign purchases).  It takes money for every item in the game, period.  Speed up's are a good example.  Do you need speed ups? Well, you decide, do you want to wait for 711 days (that's over 2 years) for a research item to finish so you can be rewarded for another deployment slot?  And 711 days is a LOT of speed ups, and each one costs money.  And get ready for in-game purchase failures.  I've purchased 6 ""packages"" so far (that's $600 folks!!) and 2 of those have failed.  The first time Amazon refunded my money, the 2nd one, yesterday (6 August 16) is ""pending"".  You want to sit around waiting for ""pending""?  I'm NOT happy about dropping $100 and waiting on what they foolishly call ""tech support"".  Bottom line, don't believe the lies, this game is one thing, and one thing only, a huge money suck.  Personally, I'm thinking class action lawsuit, all I need is an attorney that will take it on."
self direction,A flat out bad game,"Don't waste your time (or money) with this game.  I foolishly played this game for a couple months and spent a fair amount of money.  I will tell you all you need to know:-There is literally nothing to do in this game. After you get over the ""excitement"" of upgrading buildings and troops you'll discover that those cool looking battles you see on the commercials are no where to be found.  Battles take 2 seconds and have zero interaction and are completely determined by the AI.-You can spend $100s of dollars on this game and quickly realize that's just barely enough to get off the ground.  The top players spend $1000s of dollars on this game.  Prepare to get stomped every day by these players.-There is no skill involved in this game. It is purely who can spend the most money and spend the most time online.-The penalty for losing battles is incredibly high. The top players can cut your whole army down and take all your resources without batting an eye.  These armies can take weeks to build up and can disappear in 2 seconds.-You can't have a life and play this game. If something distracts you from logging in and checking on your base you will constantly lose everything in your base.  If you can't login at least once a day just forget it.  It gets to a point where all you are doing is rebuilding and not actually progressing.This game is just a giant scam and plays off of people's emotions to pump more of their hard earned dollars into this game.  My advice is to save your time and money and get any other game besides this."
power,Will you be a wallet warrior?,"mKvVAt first, this game can be quite fun; however, you will quickly realize that the game is controlled by players that have spent $10000 and more which are virtually unstoppable due to the game mechanics. These high players go around attacking relatively new players for their RSS/resources and sooner or later you will be on that list. Not to mention, the game developers are always releasing upgrades which you can only get by spending some cash.You have 2 choices when playing this game:1. Constantly open your wallet to buy $100 packages. And even if you decide that, there will be someone else that will spend more making your investment worthless.2. Not spend any money but instead be constantly attacked for your hard earned resources.I have spent quite a bit in this game and it has been one of the biggest let downs ever. If I were you, I would not spend a dime for this game or you will come to regret it."
self direction,it okay,"I like these kind of games ,but they get me bored easily. I like choosing where to lace my buildings not on the plots."
power,Not free to play,"Not free to play even a kittle . yes the game is technically free to play. But the progression is so slow that you can count yourself out. There needs to be a way to develope states where only free to play are at. There needs to be a way to keep the big people (spends of hundreds of dollars) away from small purchasers. There needs to bef balance to this game for it to be fun. Its all fun and games till your spending money on shield every 3 days to make sure u can survive another couple of days. Also you will need to controller the ""loaders"" problem (there are people who will go out purchase ur packs and charge a fee to load them). This is a huge problem as well in this game. You also could look into the actual constant promotions eveytime you log in. This game was fun. It was... But then you start to see as you hit 25m another player can completely destroy you at 4billion. This literally sets you back 1 month or 49.99. The choice is yours. I do not recommend this game to anyone unless you have 1000.00 to spend on it right away. Good luck to the people who decide not to listen to my advice."
self direction,A teen with a tablet,"As someone who is well versed in the world of gaming, the lag is terrible. I've played it in multiple locations each a different wireless range and the lag is the same across the board. Considering that I use a 4th gen Kindle Fire HD; this troubles me. With the fact that the tablet I use is a quad-core; I shouldn't have this much lag in any scenario. I am glad at least that the game itself is free and I understand that the developers have to make some money. But I will not deny my distaste of the game's favoritism to the pay-to-win faction. As for the advertising; once again I understand that in order to get such a game out there, it takes quite a bit. But I think that Arnold Schwarzenegger was a bit overkill. My advice to the developers: try the Linux approach. It's not supposed to be about the money. It's supposed to be about bringing people together to have fun. If the game were truly equalized; I know for a fact that the game would gain more positive reviews at a faster than that of which can be seen the day I posted this comment: 198 people said 5 stars. 254 people said 1 star."
self direction,My thoughts,I love this game I thought it was gonna be one of the games in this genre that would be boring and I would just uninstall the game but this is amazing 2 days and I'm totally hooked !!!!!!!!
power,Good so far,"While a good game, it needs some minor bug fixes and increase the game's smoothness. The details are very good, and they pay attention to the details. While people complain about the side packs and value deals, there is nothing wrong with them. There is nothing wrong with the game, it's only people blaming their own lack of self control on the game and saying that the developers are evil, when they are just trying to make a living. Don't blame the game on your own lack of self control, this is a very good game. I will give it 5 stars once they fix the performance. It is a great game."
self direction,Pay to Win,"Remember the good old days when you and your friends would take turns throwing $20 bills into a fire?  Then, after a few hours, whoever threw the most bills into the fire was declared the winner?  Wasn't that fun?  No?  Then, you probably shouldn't download or play Mobile Strike (or Game of War).  Your power level in the game is a function of how much you are willing to spend.  If you spend $100/month, you will be much more powerful than free players.  If you spend $500/month, you will be much more powerful than the $100/month players.  If you spend $1,000/month, you will be much more powerful than the $500/month players.  It's that simple.  If you are a free player, you will spend much time and frustration playing a crippled version of the game while the $$ players farm you over and over again while you can do nothing.  If you can put up with that for more than a few months, then bless your heart.If you are reading this review and have never really had much exposure to a true pay to win game, you might be thinking I'm exaggerating that someone would spend $1,000 a month on a mobile game.  Oh, I wish I was -- the bigger spenders (whales as they are known in the industry) easily drop that much and more.  In Game of War, this game's direct predecessor and almost identical clone that has been operating for a few years, the biggest whales have easily surpassed $100k in lifetime spending on the game.  And, while some can no doubt afford it, I am 100%, no doubt, guaranteed certain that many have gone into debt, maxed out credit cards, and ruined their lives and their families trying to keep up.  It is an addiction related to and probably very similar to a gambling addiction.  Machine Zone/Epic War (Same company) are VERY VERY good at getting you hopelessly hooked even if you think you'd never be susceptible to that kind of thing.I would not recommend it for anyone to play because:1) The gameplay is addictive, but not fun.  Most of the game consists of variation of clicking button to get awards or prizes.  If you get really into it, you will find yourself spending countless hours on it building, researching, training, opening, using times, logging onto farm accounts, trading, and more but most of this stuff soon becomes tedious chores you MUST do just to be able to keep your account competitive and the times you actually spend attacking other players are few and far between.2) There is always a bigger fish.  Any reasonable spending budget will be dwarfed by the biggest players in the game.  The only way to become a top player is to throw caution to the wind and probably max out a few credit cards.  Even then, there will always be someone else who is willing to spend a little bit more or has a little bit higher credit limit.  It's a never ending race you will never win.3) Important: If you have issues with compulsiveness, addiction (especially gambling addiction), self control, budgeting, unrestrained competitiveness or easily succumb to peer pressure, I cannot stress how important it is to never, ever start playing this game.  The very first time you open the app -- before you even start really playing -- you are bombarded with ads and offers to buy your progression in the game.  When you first join an alliance, you will feel pressure to grow your account faster so the alliance will be more powerful.  Every single new feature or new power boost they release will be behind a paywall that you will have to purchase.  You are the type of person they target -- people who have to play everything to completion, people who can't stop and walk away after losing $500 on the black jack tables, and people who have to be the biggest/best at something no matter what.It is quite common for whales in this game and others like to say things like, ""I've invested $10,000 into this account."" instead of ""I've spent $10,000 on this account.""  It's some kind of weird coping mechanism that they believe their money is being used to invest in something rather than being thrown away and it shows you how far gone most of them are.  While it's true that you can sell your accounts (against the terms of service of the game), you will usually only get a fraction of what you've spent in return and the buy/sell markets are rife with scammers on both sides -- people who take your money and not turn over the account or take it back after the transaction is complete or people who will take your account without paying.  Also, since it is against the terms of service, the account may be deleted if the game makers find out.TLDR: Stay far, far, far away."

self direction,Suffers from the same problem as most of these games ...,Suffers from the same problem as most of these games after an initial flurry of action you end up spending 90% of your time waiting for last thing you did to finish or spending a lot of money in little bits to speed things up. I was playing the version from the kindle app store and the slow down on it made the game practically unplayable with waits for a response to clicking a building or and upgrade sometimes taking minutes to appear. After trying to play several times during the day I can say that was a game issue not a hardware one.
self direction,Crashes a lot. Good base and character building but very little else to play for,"I'm writing a revised review after 6-7 days of playing the game. I originally posted 4 stars, but knocking this down to 2.Starting with the positive, there are a few elements of the game which are quite enjoyable and some pretty in depth and have received some thought from the developers. The base building element is quite good and the ability to customize your character and bases strengths and weekends by electing where to invest your skills/research time or what modifications you make upon your gear is pretty good too. However, you soon realize that there is very little else to the game. Basically the battle / 'mission' elements to the game are just lacking. Missions are basically an endeviour of clicking a start button, waiting for somewhere between 2 minutes to 2 hours to elapse and then clicking a 'collect' button - I wish I could say it was more exciting but that's it. You can wage battles against your opponents however - sound more promising? Well, you basically pick a base to attack, send your troops in, and await for them to return to here the outcome. You do not see the battle, fight the battle, influence the battle or have any real sway over its outcome as far as I can see. So you spend all your time in the game bascially just increasing elements of your base from one level to the next. Furthermore, because all base items are chained dependencies upon each other, actually your base customization is really poor. You must upgrade your Wall to upgrade your HQ, and you must upgrade your Iron Mine (I think) to upgrade your wall and so on and so forth. The chose you have of what to build becomes simply a matter of 'how many' of each item you choose to build.Next on my hit list to highlight is the games undeniable drive to have you spend your money. My character is on level 19 and has a VIP level of 7 after quite a lot of hours played this week, but for the grand total of Ã‚Â£3.99 you can start at level 50 which a VIP level of 30. Else, given the exponential increase in time it takes to build, train and research i imagine that would take about 1 month. If you don't want to spend you have a long waiting game ahead to be anywhere near those players who do. At every turn the game tries to pries you from this 3.99 investment with extra base items, unlocks for various things, huge amounts of gold etc. Its a bit too 'in your face' for my liking. I'm open minded to spending money on a game - but I first seek to see if its a game i'd like to play for some time - but alas if I spent money on this game, other than having a more powerful base I don't see what for - there's so little else to the game play that it just all feels a little pointless.The final point i'd draw attention to is the games reliability. This may not be the same for all - I guess it could be devise related but while sometimes I can play the game for over an hour, at other times the game might just exit every few minutes forcing a constant reload. It becomes really frustrating. I'm using an Amazon Fire 7"" Tablet for the record."
self direction,So....So,"The games itself is good. The concept, the graphics, there are many things that make this game good....... however the developers are losing players fast not because the game isn't fun because it is. They are losing players mainly to the fact that they increased their prices of packs due to the demand (so they say) so because they've lost a lot of players ud of thought they'd lower the prices,  instead they've done tons of updates to try n make the game better n brought out new features.... Unfortunately that hasn't helped the game. They're focusing to much time on gears and equipment n new buildings when they need to go back n 're think something"

Also, its constantly telling you to do recommended missions with a big hand pointing to the mission button which is really annoying. If you like game of war fire age and prefer modern wars rather than medevil wars, I highly reccomend it, but if not, leave this game uninstalled. If you want a great base building game, I'd reccomend star wars commander."

Contacted them several times, explaining the issue, their only response reinstall game ( have done this probably more times than I've played it now ) or check for updates which its been upto date everyday. Wouldn't be so bad but this app does require somesortof spending to fully appreciate the game and for those rare moments when it works, its a great game, its being let down by stability issues and poor customer / technical support.Honestly I'd avoid if I were you and try the same format just the medieval version Game of War.No stability issues there and better free bonuses."

self direction,Two Stars,"Stupid, I thought it was all done thru the app"
self direction,Did I do something wrong?,It would not let me sign in! It just kept loading. I thought I was doing something wrong so I checked my email to see if it was wrong and it was not. So I tried a few more times and it still didn't work!!!!!!!!Ã°??Â­Ã°??Â¤
self direction,i thought there would be more,"I really thought there would be more free music, my friends claim it gets better.  they all have it for their phones but on my tablet it's not what i was hoping for. perhaps it will grow on me."

self direction,pretty neat...but...,"I'm afraid it doesn't work on kindle as well as I thought.I tried to play my recordings and it didn't. I'm still gonna keep it and see if I did something wrong, maybe it's just me. Anyways I hope you have a good day~"
self direction,BAD,"I got this app for my kindle fire hd thinking it would be awesome but boy was I wrong. When I first tried it and it didn't work I thought it was the settings that I picked, so I tried a different setting but it still did not work. I ended up trying all of the setting but it still did not work. I would give this app zero stars if I could."
self direction,The selection that I really enjoyed was reverse,"Its a momentary pleasure and quite entertaining but has no lasting value. The selection that I really enjoyed was reverse. Made me laugh so hard. Also, once a selection (voice change) is saved it is not easily retrievable from my phone. I went to the obvious places where I thought it might be stored and it wasn't there. I dont like that that."
self direction,DO NOT GET THIS APP,I THOUGHT THIS APP was awsome but NO IT IS A HORRIBLE APP!!!!!!!!So if you think it's a cool APP ITS NOT ITS A HORRIBLE APP IT JUST DOSNT WORK FOR KINDLE FIRE!!!

security,Used for our spy themed vbs!,The kids loved this! Our agent scanned them and then held it where they couldn't see. Worked perfect for &#34;security clearance&#34; test!
self direction,It actually guessed right on the first try.,"Not that it did the following times, but c'mon people, it's a gag app - It's not supposed too.  Still, thought it was kinda amusing."
self direction,so so,my friend tried it and he thought he was 490 years old then I told him the trick. My... Okay no my...  everybody thought it was terrible except my friend.
self direction,LoL,"I actually fell for it....... feel kinda stupid actually.  I thought this would read my thumb print - as I was sitting there with my thumb pressed up against the screen it finally hit me, this is just a screen with no scanning functionality.  LOL"
self direction,bad game:(,This app is nice not what I thought. I thought it would tell my real age but it was 30 years off. It said I was 40. Don't get this app plz
self direction,Silly,Thought it to be inaccurate. A silly app. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I wouldn't use it again and you shouldn't offer it.

self direction,Creepy and Funny,"Seriously i got scared by this app! 1st time i did it the app got my age right!! I thought it was creepy and kinda funny. If it gets your age wrong then don't get mad, it's just a game!"

self direction,DO NOT DOWNLOAD!,"First of all I downloaded this on my sleep over, I had a lot of people over and we found this app and thought it would be cool and fun... ACTUALLY the complete opposite! To test it out to see if it worked' I tried two times and got 29 and 25. I even had my 3 year old sis do this and she got 31! But I gave it a star because it's funny to see how they age you. But also a waste of time!"
self direction,why was this invented,I think it sucks because I thought it would be correct
self direction,does not work!,When I first got this app I thought it would be cool and actually work. When I scanned my thumb it said I was 24 years old when I am only 13!

self direction,eh,"I read some other reviews and I don't know why everyone is so mad. Do you really think a random app on your device is going to tell your exact age?? It might say your super old, but it's just an app, it's not like it's an actually person judging you. I'm 12 and it said I was 48. I thought it was pretty funny. Learn to laugh ppl!!"
self direction,sucks,This app does not work it said I 47 years old bull crap.it also thought I was 18 yet I'm not don't get this app is sucks

self direction,My opinion,This is really stupid. it kept telling me im in the 20s all the time. im only 10!  i thought it will be close to my age but it wasnt. it said i was 26  then 25 then 23 . IM ONLY TEN!  maybe it will be close to your age but it was more than a ten year difference. That is my opionion!

stimulation,Good novelty app,"Age scanner is a good novelty app; which is also it's weakness in that the fun wears off quickly it is not a knock of the quality of the app, but rather how novelty apps lose their appeal after the first hundred tries. Still worth the download."

self direction,3 people found this helpful,I thought it actually worked. Disappointed.
self direction,3 people found this helpful,This app is ok but it does not tell you your real age but it is quite funny when it said I am 190 because I'm only 10 . But if you are over 30And you thought it was real then by better games. So this came is fine .

self direction,A FREE Ghost Hunting App that Works!,"I recently moved back home. This house has always had a lot of paranormal activity. It didn't take long for the activity to start up again. I decided to get this app. I always thought a few of the spirits in the home are deceased family members. This app confirmed my suspicions. Words, names, and nicknames that the deceased people in my family know are used started showing up at the top of the screen.  Due to so much activity over the years I thought that maybe there was something about my neighborhood that made the paranormal activity so strong. I was right. According to one spiritIf you ask questions, more than likely they will answer. If you purchase this app, please be careful. Evil deities will come through as well if you seek them."
stimulation,Just a little bit frightening...,"I was actually looking for an EVP app when I came across Ghost Radar and even after reading up on it I know relatively nothing about how it works. BUT I never considered it anything more than a novelty... AND THEN!!!!One night just before bed I decided to turn it on.The word ""Observe"" popped up. If something was there it seemed to be saying, ""Hey pay attention... listen up.""I was like alright, you got my attention.Then the words, "" Lee does great."" Shot out one after another. This had never happened before. I had used the app for about a week before this, and sometimes the app will run and nothing will come up at all, then at other times random words will come up but they rarely make any sense, and are all spread out, but 3 words at a time, right after another... I hadn't seen this before. My hair stood on end. Lee was my grandfather who had recently passed on.In addition, my wife can see ghosts. She has been able to see them since she was a little kid. Before my grandfather, Lee, passed away I asked him to come back if he could to let me know how he is. Being a Firm Bible believing Christian, I was sure things were good but I just wanted him to come back. Well, about a month ago she saw his spirit. She was working on her laptop one night in bed and just as she was turning it off she looked up and there he was, so this wasn't the first time my grandfather had made his presence known. My little Ghost Radar says, ""Lee does great."" I was actually a little shocked.""Grandpa, is that you? Are you in the presence of God?""""Freedom"" Comes the squeaky little voice from over my phone. LOL, I just started laughing! Let me tell you, the hair was standing strait up on the back of my neck!! I was VERY  pleasantly freaked out!!BUT even if this event had not happened, I would still give Ghost Radar 5 stars.  I don't understand why anyone would rate this app any less. What in the world are people actually expecting? To really contact ghosts? There is only one ghost you need to contact... the Holy One.Peace!"
self direction,What is classic?,"As some say, the ""jury is still out"" on if ghosts do indeed exist. I only wanted to see this app in action but did not use to any significant enjoyment. 3 stars for the confusion I am experiencing over the inclusion of the word ""Classic"" in the title. -Glon"
power,Give it a try.,"I got the ""Connect"" version of the Ghost Radar after downloading this app, and have had some good fun with it. This version is much more simplistic, as all it is is the radar and words, but in all reality that's good enough. The Connect version has a ""Vox"" box added into it, but I honestly don't even know what I'm looking for with that, so it doesn't mean anything to me. It also has a camera added into it so you can take pictures, a flashlight button (that doesn't even use my actual light, just turns the screen white), an audio recording button (which can be fun to use), and a ""night"" mode, which turns your screen a dark red. There is also a tab which shows the time and date of all the past recordings you've done, along with past blips on the radar (and how close they were), and past words that have been said. The Connect app is cool if you're really wanting and/or trying to catch some activity, but if you don't really care all that much, this version will be fine. Only reason I gave it four stars is because I'm not 100% sure it's legit. Download it and see for yourself if you believe it to be real or fake.**Please note: The Connect version of this app requires it to ""warm up"" before getting accurate readings. Meaning it has to take a bit (I'd say it typically takes about 20-30 minutes to warm up) to adjust to all the surrounding noises before any of the readings could be considered legit. There are no lights on this app to show whether it's warmed up yet or not, (there's a red, yellow, and green button on Connect that indicate how warmed up it is) but I assume it's the same for this app and still requires warming up. That being said, don't trust or believe the dots that pop up or words that are said as soon as you open the app, there is a high probability that there is nothing paranormal about these. On an ending note, it is said that putting the scan frequency on the ""Low"" setting gives you more accurate readings as well, as it doesn't pick up as much stuff, meaning the stuff that it DOES pick up is more likely something paranormal. However, as the description is falsely put (and as Spudd Pickles says himself) your phone/tablet is not capable of picking up EMF (electromagnetic fields). The theory is that intelligent entities can pick up on the fact that they can influence words on your phone, or show themselves through it. Your phone does not and cannot pick up EMF signals however."
self direction,Quite an enjoyable shiver!,"Whether or not you believe, this app will DEFINITELY make you question the possibilities! Eerily relevant responses from ""the unseen realm""! Seriously, though, I bought this as a lark, expecting very little. However, within minutes of starting the radar, I was quite unnerved by some of the words coming through.Also, I know plenty of Kindle Fire users are complaining about not having a microphone to pick up voices, but I find that to be a benefit, as the app can't confuse random surrounding sounds as possible voices. O simply explain out loud that any entity that wishes to communicate can simply use the Kindle to speak to me. I have had very impressive sessions with different people, and different locations, each situation having different interactions, and outcomes.Just give it a fair try, and I promise you shouldn't be disappointed."
universalism,Worried,"Guys, this thing is no joke. I went with my father and step mother to an old civil war battlefield a few nights ago. (I had downloaded this app one week prior) I started the app and started asking questions most people would ask a ghost. Who are you? Is there anyone here? I had a camera set up to film everything. I set down my kindle fire to check the video then I hear the word ""college"". I'm a college student. I brushed it off and kept checking the camera then it says ""surrounded"" and I get a chill down my spine. I went to check it and the screen showed 4 bright red signatures. Now THAT got my attention. I went back to the camera (this time with the kindle to watch the signals) and kept doing what I was doing. Occasionally, I would look at the screen the check those signals. They were still there. They had not moved. I could feel eyes on me. Watching me. I hear ""blood"" come on the app. At that point, I realized it was time to go. Coincidence? Maybe. But to me, I was about to **** my pants."
self direction,Nice for Halloween,"Don't really know what to say about this one... the kindle fire is not exactly built with quality ghost electricity detection capabilities.  Still, it is a fun little program on Halloween night when exploring a spooking location, or if you want to make yourself hyper-aware at one o'clock in the morning and have nightmares."
self direction,CREEPY AND COOL,I love this app. So today I saw a red dot on the radar and then it said petty then I saw it again  only a lot farther away from me!Then I saw and heard the words stronger. Then I thought it was my grandmother that past away when I was six years old. I don't live in her hours I live a lot farther than away from her. I really think this app is very creepy and cool.P.S I am eight years old.
self direction,My Mind is blown,"Nevertheless I thought that my dad's house isn't haunted, then I saw this app and decided to give it a try. As soon as I turned the app on, red, green, blue and yellow dots appeared in random places. I first asked what is your name and then it's MAGIC. I then asked is your name MAGIC and it said AUNT. I was looking at the backyard and it said FENCE. I asked you saw the fence and no reply. After a few minutes of no activity, two red dots appeared at the top right of the radar and asked who are you and other questions it said OLD. I asked are you old or is it the house. The I asked to show up on the radar as a red dot if it is their age that is old or show up as a blue, yellow, or green dot if the house is old. A few minutes later, two yellow dots came up. MY WAS BLOWN AFTER THAT!!!!!! :P You should get this app."
self direction,Another great experience,"Another set of words came thru along with some anomalies, these were the words, in sequential order: warn, company, porch, and horse. I put it together and thought, could this mean a horse could show up on my porch and this is just a warning"
self direction,"Believe or not Believe, that is the question.","I'm not sure if I believe in this stuff but it was very interesting. My daughter got the app and after listning to her storys I thought I would get it. There wasn't much activity when I turned it on until my Husband walked in the room then there were 2 red dots on the radar and the word ""Established"" came up. I had just gotten out of the shower, talking to my husband, naked I might add, and the word ""Beautiful"" came up. Now I could flatter myself and think it was talking about me but I just brushed it off then I had to give my husband Insulin, 2 shots which he doesn't like very well and was grumbly about it, when I was through I looked at my Kindle and another word popped up, ""Necessary"" Coincidence? I don't know but it is very entertaining and I would recommend it for entertainment purposes."
self direction,WOW WORKS,AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS FAKE BUT I IS NOT FAKE IT IS ALSO SCARY I AM SCARED NOW
tradition,Very accurate,I stared this app up and dots appeared then it said the word GERMAN. I am from a German heritage so I think it pretty creepy that this app said that. Download this app it is very entertaining. PS you must turn on LBS for this app to work. ---NMS---
self direction,AWESOME APP,"I got this app just because I thought it would be fake and fun, but it's real! I was explaining to my little sister that there aren't ghosts in the kindle fire, but that there are ghosts in the room. After that , I said that a ghost is behind her, and sitting on her head, and the ghost said ""beside"" . Super cool!"
self direction,Its more psychological....,"Well, I wouldn't consider this a fake ....but the likely possibility is that they just have random dots appearing and design it like a real ghost radar and have random common words appearing. I just downloaded it and when I opened my app, it was like ""pot "" and on the right side of me there was a flower pot. I thought it was cool, but come on, there are pots everywhere! either in your yard or somewhere else, you can always find something common with the random word that appears on the radar. Its a cool app, but in my opinion, they just choose a buncha random words that make you think this app can ""detect "" stuff when your fooling yourself out. I was using it this morning on my bed and it was like ""can, winter, principal ""?! Wtf, am I in school or something? lol but this app is worth the download even though it might be fake."
self direction,i think it actually works,"When I was in my room I had my kindle turned on to this app.It kept saying stuff that didn't make sense but after an hour when it started getting dark out,there was at least six red dots on my screen,they were all around the screen but one did not move.I looked on the screen I thought it was actually really close to where I was sitting,it then said shoulder.I got a little freaked.I also asked some questions about back then when JFK was around and I said I bet he was a great president,it said agreed,I know what happend to the people in the house it was in the 60s they were around so I suggest if you know when the people lived in that house ask it questions when they were around,it really does work trust me."
universalism,Sweet and kinda freaky,"Okay so I bought this app and was like cool whatever and ignored it for a while. Today I looked at it in my room and I got a little activity. This is wat I got:(Top left corner activity level125) none realize | spreading log fire trouble | after that I was like woah is this real?and gotten word understanding. I shrieked and shut it off. Later I was watching the news when I saw a news report about a log fire at a camping sight. It had started 5 minutes before I started getting activity. Supposedly, some teenagers at a site  were  messing  around and then went to bed. None of the realized a fire had started and one of the teens was rushed to the hospital. So yea. Awesome app"
self direction,to scary for me,when I got this app I thought it was cheap. where my family lives it used to be train tracks.... and while I was in the kitchen had two dots one was red and the other was blue ... I knew the red was me but the blue was in my garden where the train tracks were.this app tells the truth a ghost has been haunting me ever since I moved to this house . about when I was 6 a ghost was behind me and it felt like a gun was to my back..... I was fully awake!
self direction,hmmm,So t is ok but don't know I mean it gave me like 5 dots as soon as I started I thought there might by 1 because the person that used to live here died in the basement before I moved in and that is kind of creepy and my house is just creepy anyway but I am thinking of bring it to my schools bathrooms because they are honted for sure so I might try there
self direction,scary,First I thought that I didn't have ghosts but when I was taking my kindle downstairs  2 blobs came on and 1 of them turned blue and when I got 2 the 5th step it disappeared. That scared the crap out of me because I did think that the stairs were a little spooky.
self direction,Too Scary!,"So, I downloaded this app. It was soooo freaky!!! At first, I was about to enter the shower when it said 'Water Running'. I looked, and the water was dripping. Creepy! Another time I thought is saw a ghost wearing a white dress once in the bathroom, and I stuck my Kindle in there, and it said White Ghost.Another time it said 'Bone Breaker' at a hotel, then 1 day later I fell down the stairs and broke my Arm. THIS THING IS REAL!!"
self direction,I am a ghost,Yeah I am a ghost. I downloaded this app and thought it was a joke/prank because it was 1 April. But I am a ghost remember. So I installed this app on my kindle fire HD. And it started detecting me as a ghost in the center of the radar. I was shocked that humans evolved so much that they left their work and started detecting me. How foolish of them. Then I was pretty much shocked and I fainted but a ghost does not faint so I got up. But more important it works so please all ghosts reading this review please download this app. And humans beware.  One day we will develop a app of detecting humans so don't worry. I am .
self direction,very intimidating.,"This app seems to work very nice. Ghosts are in my house all the time-consuming I see, hear, and feel them. We had a Ouija board out and this app on and we got words that we didn't expect. We came to find that I have a three year old girl named Elizabeth, a boy which remains U.N. named, and an adult named Corey, aged 22. This app works, because right after my friend left I was alone in the house- I thought. I felt a freezing cold thin layer on my back, and the back of my arms, as if I was being protected out something. I heard a crash outside, and the feeling went away. Turns out, some kids were trying to scare me, but I had no idea who they were even! They walked away when they found out I had a knife, so I haven't seen them again. But it's weird, because they were dressed in old clothes; they were pale, and looked tired or sick. I'll never know! Just be careful, you never know what you're summoning..."
self direction,mysterious,"this app seems so real!  today my friend was drawing and she just drew a line then a ghost said underline. then later a bunch of ghosts showed up and we were all yelling and pointing at it and then a ghost said angry! I guess it was angry at us. another time, there was no ghosts for a long time then a whole bunch showed up all at once. we thought that was really weird.  then a ghost said mysterious! that is so creepy! later we were sitting by a brick fire place and then a ghost said brick! I doubted that this was real but now I'm not so sure'"
self direction,Legitimate,"When I first got this app at my old house it worked and now at my supposedly ""New"" house it's working even more! I tried to go to the area it said a ghost was and once I went there I thought I saw somethingI do very recommend this but be warned, this will scare the crap out of you!"
self direction,Fun but creepy.,"When I got this app, I thought it would be fun for me and my brother. But istead, it gave me the creeps. I first thought my house was raided by ghosts. D: I felt like moving out at first. So be careful when playing this app!"
self direction,creepy,I had the app an independent I was talking to my ex about how is sister died then it said hi Ã¢?Â¦Ã¢?Â¦Ã¢?Â¦ rylieÃ¢?Â¦Ã¢?Â¦Ã¢?Â¦Ã¢?Â¦ I'm Ã¢?Â¦Ã¢?Â¦Ã¢?Â¦Ã¢?Â¦Ã¢?Â¦ok Ã¢?Â¦Ã¢?Â¦Ã¢?Â¦Ã¢?Â¦Ã¢?Â¦Ã¢?Â¦hide I got really scared bc rylie is the boys name and she died Will playing hide and seek by falling down the stairs
universalism,Fun!,"I downloaded this to creep out my wife. I fired it up and had it running when she entered the room. I explained that it will detect spirits and they can communicate to us through it. Our dog then entered the room and it said ""pony"". Our dog is very large and is commonly referred to as moose, horsey and...pony! I figured it was just a randomly generated word but decided to use it to tease my wife so I said ""There is a spirit trying to communicate with us and it saw the dog come into the room and called it a pony!"" It then said ""understanding""! It freaked us both out. I'm not going to show this one to the kids or they may not be sleeping well."
self direction,coincidence or ' real??,I thought it would be fun to play with my friend so w  we're walking all of a suddenit said trip about 10 second  later I tripped and dropped my  kindle then it said drop and a few minutes later we were practicing a cheer called jam an  it said jam then cheer we were so scared we literally ran into my room locked the door and covered ourselves in.  Blanket I believe in this app you should get it
self direction,creepy,"do i decided to use this app so i get on my kindle and start using it. its starts saying things like accident and hurt, car, flip, i was like ok creepy. so i walk out into the kitchen and ky mom is crying its turns out that my aunt rebecca was in a car accident and the far flipped 6 times and she and her newborn baby Henry my own fusing were severely hurt. i thought this was some stupid little app. after that i was really scared and was like wow i cant believe that worked with that accuracy. this is not something i would make up I'm telling the truth!!!"
self direction,amazing,"as soon as I got it I opened it in my bed room, and the first thing it said was art and I have art stuff all around my room O.o I thought it was just a word bank that reads words randomly but then it said collection and I have a collection of nail polish in my room, and it said saturday and today is friday. then as soon as my mom left to go to go pick up my brother from school it said mom leave........... I don't know if something is here or not. I'm still going around with this thing but I am strong believer in ghosts."

self direction,Great app and Spirits answer!,"When I first opened this app, it said 'brass'. I thought out loud saying ""I don't think I have anything brass."",Then a spirit replied 'try'.  I think what it meant was try to think. then it showed 2 spirits, one between me and the tv, and,one next to it. Its an old tv, so it might have brass in it. Me and my dad are extreme believers, so this really shocked me when it replied! Love this app. Get it!"

self direction,Pretty Interesting,"Well I looked at all the reviews, and it came out pretty interesting. Of course, this app probably deserves a few more 5 star reviews considering that some kids thought it was a game. Its pretty cool, freaky, and sent chills up my spine. As people offered me to go walk, I declined. I then turned on the radar, and caught 2 words: didn't, walk. Creepy, but extremely interesting. Probably useful for freaking out friends, family, or little kids."
self direction,Totally dose what it soppost to..,wen I was going to the liveing room it said gray..wich is the color of the walls..and I thought nahh it cant be..but then I went to the bathroom..and as son as I turns the light off..it said black..and also..it keep saying public and tables and beat..and the name of a friend..of mine...I think it may be trying to say that he well fight in school somewhere...sigh yup just like my friend is a hot head...hopefully I'm wrong...but this this app is the stuff.really creepy too......I mean really!!
stimulation,Its kinda fun but definitely  fake,I got this cuz I'm into the show ghost adventures. so I was like cool a ghost app (new it woulndnt work ) so I was playing around on it and I got a bit scared. then I read the reviews and some reviewer had said it said Jimmy. the first word the app said to me was Jimmy. they really should mix the words a bit better. but id say get it. its free and it provides entertainment like it should. would have gave it 4 stars if it mixed the words up better.
self direction,its real and this is my story,ok so I thought this was fake but I know in 1873 a girl was hanged for murderer and her ghost still lives here so one day I was on my ditecter and like 12 red dots came up and it said murder you than it said hanged and then my chair moved. and fell over . than when I was watching Tv then it turned off so I got my ghost radar and 1red dot was infront of me and than my baby brother was.crying and screaming then. I saw a fugure in my. brothers room then his door slammed.
self direction,im not sure if it actually works,"First off, I bought this because I thought it would be fun....wrong!! At first it was.....but then my daughter was playing on it and she figured out that it does not track ghosts but reads your apps instead!!! So don't be a sucker and get this app....just don't!!"
self direction,spook,"i downloaded it and thought it was fake but then.........i was playing around with it and it traked a ghost of a person who had the nickname of ""the jones"" and the word appeared ""jones"" and tons of other stuff but.....ill bore you"
self direction,It does work!,"I thought that this app would be entertaining for me for whenever I got bored. The first time I used it, the words that manifested were hit and miss. It was more accurate the second time. The third day, I thought, what the heck, I'll go to the cemetery and give it a shot. I went to my parents grave and talked to them for a few minutes. The first two words were: minute, longer. Then I asked my dad if he remembered when he told me that he would try to let me know that he was ok whenever he passed over. Right after that, his name popped up on my phone. I was speechless! I guess he was telling me to give him a minute longer to let me know that everything was good. It was a jaw dropping, yet, ecstatic experience that I will NEVER forget."
self direction,it works,"Well when i first got this i thought in my mind ""this wont work ghost arent real.."" and right as i thought that a red dot appeared and it said evidence that creeped me out then it said wet which is weird because we have a leak in the house it also said mine but im not sure what that means anyway i think that this app works and is pretty cool and made me believe"
security,wow!,My friend went to the closet to hang up some things and it showed up 2 green dots and a red one.and I said one dot is getting closer to you a green one.she said why?And the radar said safety and the red dot got really close to the other ones.The day before it said behind TV and there was a Tv behind me.It also said Greek happy cry and look.wow weird Wright?
self direction,Amazing,"while exploring the yard all of a sudden it said EXPLORING IN DIRECTION and then I turned and then it said MARK FATHER it had amazing qualities and its not a waist if your time.You can't sit thinking they will come to you maybe they will, but go explore like me I explore cemeteries and the yard.Also by a metal gate it says magnet 100 TRUE"
self direction,legendary,Best app ever it works 100% one day I went to my basement and turned the app on and it said I'm then your then great then grandpa witch I thought was really creepy because this used to be my great grandfathers house :0 hope this review helped u :)
self direction,so real my daughter is scared!!,My daughter wanted the app so bad so I got it for her and said that a dot popped up and said I am sitting with u hi. She thought it was her dead brother at first this game is not fake trust me!!! Don't listen to the haters that say this isn't real cause it is!!
security,creepy,"one of the first words I herd was protection. so does this mean that its my gardian angel. but I also got help, taken, and stranger so I think there is more than one. plus it showed I had 3 in my living room. idk if I should be scared or not."
self direction,Animals or people spirits,"I got this game a few weeks after I saw the Conjuring. I didn't believe that spirit stuff could be THAT crazy or dramatic. Some kids at my middle school believe I'm psychic. I sometimes see things, I sometimes hear things, and when I wake up in the morning after a dreamless sleep, I have (a) scratch(es). I'm not sure if I'm going then myself or there is some sort of spirit who likes or hates me. I've watched Celebrity Ghost Stories in the past but I stopped when I entered 5th grade two years ago. Now, as a seventh grader, I'm not interested in this stuff anymore. I got this app to see how fake it was. Our parents were asleep so we (my sister and I) thought that was close to""alone"" so I turned this on. We have had many pets before. They all died except one that I set free. When I started my homework, I saw a blue dot kind of behind-ish and right-ish. I looked at where you see communication and it said. I said hi and how are you. I said if you want me to turn it off to not die yourself. Nothing appeared so I kept my saying and came into here. This is a great app.Ooh! Just now I realized a dog died next door. When I said "" Bailey"" two dots appeared. More coming soon!"
self direction,Wow!!!,"Ok people, God is real, the devil is real, and angels are real. So are spirits! Sometimes ghosts seek revenge, or they are friendly. This app is real. Here are what the signals : red, it is very strong. Yellow, strong. Green, weaker. Blue, barely there. This is real. Here's what it did to me one time: I was on my kindle fire on the couch, and it said ""wind"". I thought it meant something, so I went to the weather channel. Believe it or not, but there was a big tornado watch in the south, thank goodness I don't live down there. I'm never trying in my bedroom, though. I'm afraid. I admit it. But this app is real. Trust me."
self direction,Fun to play with,"I always enjoy watching Ghost Adventures and The Dead Files so downloaded this free for the fun of using it. When my son used it he got some action and a few words so he enjoyed playing with it. When I used it nothing, but still one of those things that is fun to pull out when you are bored to waste a little time. We have not tried it outside the home. I would like to point out that even the expert ghost hunters don't get action everytime they do a lockdown at a location so just have fun with it!"
stimulation,AWESOME SAUCE,"Okay, about a month ago, I was in my room getting ready for school. I was in a cross between: a Gryffindor  sweat shirt with worn skinny jeans and Ugg boots or a Camp Half Blood t shirt with skinny jeans and high tops. So I asked the Ghost Radar,"" Oh wise and powerful ghost in my room, which shall I WEAR?!"" I waited.and waited.and waited. then I freaked out. it said:"" Wear, sweat, shirt"" I literally cried out in excitement!!!!! This ghost had taste like a huge nerd like me!!!!!Theresa(:"
self direction,Looked fun,"A friend of mine downloaded this app for his smart phone, so I thought I'd try it. Not as fun as it looked."
self direction,wow,"first time I had a paranormal experiance with this app I was in an old hotel from the cival war. a dot popped up, and I asked it who he was. it answered,BEN. I asked if he was the previous owner of the hotel. it answered, SOLDIER.Another time, in my house, it was on, and a dot popped up. I asked who it was, and it did not answer, so iasked where it was from. it said, Africa. A few minutes later, it said cotton, so I began to think a cotton slave was in my room.I thinkthe most amazing was that I asked on dot who he was,( he always seemed to appear in my doorway, where I hang a cross) and it answered SOURCE than a few minutes later, OF, and then an few seconds later,CHRISTMAS.  You can only imagine what I thought then.I have had many more encounters with this app,and I don't know if it is real, but has kept me on my toes."
self direction,omgosh!,ok so I just got this app ive deleted it a few times cause I thought it was dumb but then I was in my room and it was facing my mirror and it said glass then it said stronger and stronger is the name of one of my books! get the app its awesome!
self direction,TOTALLY LOVE IT!,"Gosh, is this spooky? I always thought that our bus was Haunted! I took this amazing app and watched it detect 3 ghosts. One said RUN. One said LEAVE. One said GO. Wow!"
self direction,creepy,"I thought I wasn't in a haunted house!,and a red dot came up!,so freaky,an I hear yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee until it STOPS!,if your under 7 don't buy it!"
self direction,amazing,"when I got this app I didn't know what it did. I thought it was stupid. then I read what people said on it and then tryed it again. it then said "" fighting"" and I knew it was true. my dad and step mom where fighting for like a day or 2. I waited and waited and nothing happened. I got scared of what it would say next. so I turned it off."
self direction,Weird!,"This game is fake, I know. Its really creepy, though. My mom was in the kitchen cooking and it said Tom. A few minutes later it said Help. My mom was joking around about how Tom wanted to help her cook. But then she went back to cooking and was about to pull out a pot when the radar said Pot. When I thought it couldn't be creepier, it said Cooking.Weird!"
stimulation,freaky,"it works. just give it time and a green,yellow,or red dot will appear(I don't know what they mean.) I would recommend this app to people who don't think this app works; I challenge you:)"
self direction,creepy,"when I got this app I thought it. was fake but its not because me and my sister were running this app and we. caught a lot off ghost then we got words such as infomation,end,purpose, buldier,cade,service, green,motor,ring,death,buried,steal,share,that's,topic,helpful, dull,rising,veiw,and more butt after that her clander started moving then her curtains"
self direction,"Good program, limited in use.","A few people in my apartment complex are getting into the whole Ghost Radar App thing. Most of them only have the Classic version. After watching videos of the Legacy edition in action I decided I'd pay the measly 99 cents for Legacy after using classic and it's worth it. You get a lot more detection out of Legacy and it logs your words so you don't have to constantly write them down like with classic. Of course if all you care about is an entertaining ghost detection app that may or may not really find ghosts, doesn't record your words, and doesn't detect nearly as many ghosts in the flox then by all means entertain yourself and your buddies with classic. I say go with legacy though if you've got the extra buck to spend on an entertaining albeit possibly fake app."
self direction,creepy but awesome,"I saw this app one day and thought it was neat to try so me and little cousin went to the cemetery and nothing happened so on the way home I suggested we go back at night, my dad overheard me and said it probably illegal. that moment the app said ""police"" we all stared at each other. then it said weather, then 5 minutes later a thunderstorm occurred I love this app"
self direction,"scary, really scary","First time I turned it on it had a bunch of readings about teriyaki, then my parents brought home teriyaki... then it said a weird word that I looked up, it ment ringing of bells, and I was ringing a bell... then I went to my friends house and she thought her house was haunted, turned it on and waited for it to get used to the house, started out ok then, it said I control we and a bunch I mean a bunch of red dots appeared, I turned it off because my friend was scared to death, then I turned it back on an hour later and it said demon and had a red dot right behind me... never using it again..."
self direction,"Pretty cool,  yet freaky","When I first got this app, I thought that it was just something funny, yet it creeped me out when I first got it. I don't believe in ghosts, but still. Otherwise, cool app for ghost - story lovers!"
self direction,School is Haunting,"I didn't begin yet but I'm going to my school because I'm told the three lockers by me are haunted and at my singing thing,my lil sister saw what she thought was one of her closest friends relatives who said when he died, he'll watch our performance.I know it'll work.:)"
self direction,still questioning.,"im still not sure what too think of this app. lately it seems to be more actively giving information. ill give you three examples. the other night i had it on, and i was watching a movie. i wasnt paying attention to what it was saying until it said listen. so i waited, the word kepler came up. so i googled it. there was a man, a well known lawyer who had been missing until his body was found, his name was kepler. then about ten minutes ago when i was in the bathroom it said "" henry somebody large."" i just thought i would give it a shot so i google Henry large...he also died. now im not sure yet if this constitutes as a real app to talk with ghosts. although it does frighten me a bit when it says lets play or when i tell my roommate the spirits wont talk with me and the app says ""try."" its alot better when you have two devices with the app whirring at the same time."
stimulation,Novelty,"While I do enjoy the Horror Genre, I do also have an interest in the paranormal.  So I figured, let me get this little novelty item for my kindle. It's kind of freaky to use late at night.  Although I won't go so far as to say it's real.  But if you want a little freaky app to kind of get you mildly jumpy/scared at night, here it is"
self direction,I don't know whats going on...,It freaked me out when I bought it. I thought green and red dots were something eles... What are they anyway. After that my heart start racing... looking around I tried to not think of it. Someone tell me what's going on?! Freaking Scared!!!
self direction,Ghost Radar Classic,Great for Holloween! Kinda creepy. Go on when you least expected. It's a neat little gaget to play with I thought it was worth getting.
self direction,HOLY CRUDMONKEYS!!!!,"ok at first I thought this was fake,until I went to my dead grandfathers side of his bed and it detected something. he was my favorite person in the world,and it said ""favorite"". above the bed there is his favorite picture that was framed,and the thing said ""frame"""
self direction,Spooky!,"It was a fun little app for a few hours. After a while, the ghosts would show up in the same spot on the radar no matter where I was eventually, so it became boring. Either the ghosts just like to follow me on my right side, or the app stopped creating random blips and got stuck in the same postition. lol Like I said, it was fun for a short time. Uninstalled it now."
self direction,Spooky!,"I was going to get my laundry downstairs and I was bringing my kindle with me to see if this app works. And all of the sudden the system said ""Fresh"". I ran up the stairs and thought about the voice over and over again."
self direction,totally freaky,we where in a civil war house and thought we would have some fun by turning on ghost radar well it was saying foriegn French gas oil death bone. after that it said select any transportation then it said names including my dads
self direction,surprised,"so when i got this app i thought. that this would be a rip off but turns out it, worked. i sleep  in a basement. the first word that i saw Was hidden and it pointed northeast so i decided to take a look when i close i heard and saw a  mouse run by it almost. scared me to death great app."
self direction,creepy,"one day I was on that radar thing and it said ""death "".I didn't worry though I thought it was fake but the. next day my grandpa died and he is only 62"
self direction,meaningless,"I read the reviews and thought it would be creepy but the only thing creepy is that a voice randomly says a word when you aren't expecting it to. you see a few boils on the screen and then they disappear. you can interpret anything you want from the random words. impressionable people, teenagers and children might get spooked.  best leave the door closed to this kind of stuff anyway."
self direction,it's real,Kind of creepy. Ive had this app on my kindle and I phone. I thought it was bs but I use it now and it's really as if entities are really there watching communicating
self direction,I think it's actually real!!,"I love this app. Me and my Nana play around with it a lot, and we both believe in ghost/spirits. One time my Nana was cleaning the house, and I turn this app on while she was vacuuming. Then a red dot appeared and the word ""Attempt"" popped up. A second later the word ""organization"" appeared. I thought about my Nana cleaning the house and that attempt organization means clean house. After that ""wherever"" popped up and I thought it was saying clean the house wherever it needs to be cleaned. I think this app is pretty cool!"
self direction,scared me to death,"I was in the living room with my brother and I put the scanner on, I told him it was fake and just said words. the. it took forever but it said parent wich my parents were in their room. then I moved over to the other side of the living room, which is close to the window that leads to the backyard where my dog recently died and my dad buried him. I faced the kendle towards the window and a dot came up and said hurried. I freaked out and turned the kendle off. I don't know if this thing is real or not,  but I sure got freaked out. my brother thought it said fairy, but it read hurried on my screen, he does not know how to read. does anyone no what the different colored dots mean"
self direction,vary strange,"while ago around Midnight i had to use the bathroom, while i was in i began hearing what i thought my father in the living room and something that he may have dropped, when i came out nobody was around. i begansecurity check around the area when i notice are backdoor lock was unlocked even though i had just ""checked"" before using the bathroom minutes ago,so i started up the app an got one word out of three that surprised me ""JOE"" we have a Neighbor in are apartment by the name JOE, this paranoids me.i hope he is NOT ""astral projecting"" in are home,"
self direction,Pretty good,"I thought it was pretty good.  It works better in the morning.  A wierd experience was it said dot then like 7 dots in a row showed up.  Last night it was stuck on ""native"".  I don't believe in ghosts anyway but I thought it would be fun!"
self direction,NOT A JOKE!,This app is creepy. My friends and I were eating lunch and the radar was on and it said lunch. I thought it was fake so I was eating and it said good. My friends and I freaked out and I said it's fake. I got a drink and it said coke. Then it said good and choice. I think my friends and I wet our pants.
self direction,wow... just wow,"I don't really say my house is haunted. But one night I tried it and I joked around like I thought it wasn't real. I was saying &#34;Did you fart?&#34; and &#34;You need to take a shower!&#34; But what really got me was a red dot appeared and it said STOP. I stopped talking and then I asked to show me a sign that your there. I saw my curtains move, but I did not have any fan on or air conditioner. The Windows weren't open either. I got scared for a moment and then It said SORRY. Then I said I'm not scared because I didn't want to show fear. TOPIC... SCHOOL. Then it went away. The next day I came into school and I found out that my ELA TOPIC was ghosts. Get this app... they are here with us now."
self direction,does not work!!!!!!!,"ok, so i got this app not entirely sure what to expect, but i thought it was pretty cool. so my sister got the same app. we were sitting next to each other in my room and we both had it on. i placed my kindle fire right next to.hers, like, RIGHT NEXT TO HERS and she had all these Dolores dots everywhere.and different words showing ul and i.didn't have any colorful dots and i got different words. this proves tonne that those app DOES NOT WORK!!!!!! i hope i helped somebody in making their decision in getting this app. just because this app.doesn't work, doesn't mean i don't believe in ghosts, but this app is not real. do not get it!"
self direction,Scary!,"It tells me that my dads couch spot is haunted. its worth it! I recommend this app to all ghost lovers and mystery lovers! scares you a little but is F-U-N-N-Y! I got a couple of words like; ' below' and 'someone'. When I saw 'below' I thought basement, which we always thought was haunted. When it said 'someone' I looked at the window and there was a wasp trying to get in."
self direction,Cool,I was in my living room alone. All of a sudden. A dot appeared. The letters said ..m..fff. I didn't know what that meant. Then two dots appeared. One yellow. The other red with a blue dot in the middle. The letters said m..kk. So I thought they were saying mkay. I think it was my Uncle... He died of his brainal cord disconnecting. He was punched.

self direction,I guess it wasn't free,I thought it was free
self direction,"For being a free app, I give it 5 stars","I really had fun taking my son's hand drawn home floor design and creating it in this app. It does pretty much everything I needed it to do. The amazing thing is I was able to see some flaws in my son's design that he will update in his floor plan. The app does a great job of showing the length and width of rooms and total floor space, as well as the ability to put in appliances and furniture which gives you a real perspective on the size space you need. The developer is very easy to contact by email and he is continuing to improve the app. I agree with some of the improvements suggested in other reviews, but this app does 95% of what I needed and it's free to boot. For that I give it 5 stars."
self direction,Better than paper,This is fun to mess with. I just wish it had more stuff like a fireplace and a way to specify built ins. I have a thing for creating floor plans. This is way more fun than drawing them on paper.
self direction,What I wanted but comes with many frustrations.,"I'm the kind of person that moves around furniture a lot. When I first started doing it I would just move things hoping they would fit. I then started using graph paper to better plan the moving. Now that I found this app this seems like this is the best thing to be doing when it comes to planning out the moving.I would have loved to give this a better rating but there are too many frustrations with this app. First of all don't turn your device portrait style or you'll get blasted with ads. Landscape doesn't seem to show ads, and that's great. My main problem with this app is that it doesn't respond the same way each time. Sometimes I want to move an object and it'll move just fine, but other times it will resize itself instead of moving, very frustrating.Things I do like about this app:-You can measure the room out and all your furniture to your exact measurements.-You can add windows, doors, closets, and ""dead space"" so you really know where you can and can't move your furniture.-You can put things at angles.-You can save your design, kinda (I'll get into more of this later).Things I don't like about this app:-The save your design thing... Sure you can save it but there's a watermark on it. If you want to save a different size or save the plan without the watermark it will cost you money.-It's not responsive the same way twice. It's very frustrating when you try to move an object an it resizes itself. Now I know how the app works and I get that when the arrows appear it will resize the item but a couple of times it would do it while I was just trying to move the item and the arrows weren't displaying. If you have a small device this would be a very frustrating app to use.-Ads in portrait mode and block a good part of the screen.-You have to zoom in and out a lot if you are working with smaller furniture.-There are no desks in the premade shapes, I just used a table instead but I thought that was odd given that they had many other things including a chair!"
self direction,"Love, love, LOVE it!",This tool is GREAT for my daughter who loves creating architecture!!!!! We recommend this for anyone who loves to great and especially for those creative minds!
power,Great for what it is...however it needs more,"This is a great app I've been using to play around with how to add a new room to the house.  Controls are simple to learn and before no time I was up and running playing around with the app.  Very nice to be able to visualize what I need and want in a house design and simple enough for contractors to view what exactly I want without having to survey/re-survey the property and design from scratch.I did mention it needs more.  Over the past few weeks of using this, I noticed it needs the following:Exterior wall and interior wall widths.  Right now you can only set it for one wall thickness and the exterior walls are usually wider than the interior.  Be nice to be able to set these to different values.Needs a 'nudge' option.  Positioning with your finger (or stylus) is fine, but sometimes I need to 'nudge' it a virtual inch or two.  It would be nice if there was an option to nudge the floor in the direction needed.Landscape.  I know this is for floorplans, but the ability to place property boundaries of the house as well as simple outside things such as sidewalks, driveways and SWIMMING POOLS to be able to plan and get ideas to play around with, would really make this enjoyable.But as I mentioned, it's a good app (especially for the money) and enjoy using it."
stimulation,Great App,I love moving my furniture around. This app is great as you can enter in dimensions. It is a little difficult but worth the challenge. If you can figure it all out it will be so helpful. I am having my kitchen remodeled and before they came to measure I had the whole thing mapped out on the app. I just can't say enough good things. Now that I have the actual measurements I am going to enter them all in and make modifications to their plan.
self direction,eeh,so. this app was glitchy at first. I thought it was just a thing with all apps where its a little weird at first but gets better. it did not get better. it ducks. I give it 3 stars because I was only able to tolerate one house I designed. but when I started anotherÃ¢?Â¦ it freaked out/ spazzed out. not worth my time.
self direction,personally like but has limits and ads,"Ok, first, you ALWAYS get what you paid for. Free. So let's start there. Second, yes, of course, there are ads. I personally expected that and don't really mind. I've used the app quite a while and, for the most part just exit the ad and move on. Note, other reviewers said they tried to pay more for app without ads and were unable. Oh well.1 other review noted a limit to the number of plans. Huh? I've created about 25 with no end in sight. Another stated they had a hard time controlling room and furniture size. Room size is easy, there is a ""click"" control in the settings feature. Just turn it off. Play around with this and you'll see, it's hard to explain but it locks in certain sizes if you have it turned on and is VERY helpful if you are creating multiple variations on a floor plan on the same screen. It's EXTREMELY easy to turn off and back on this feature. As for furnishing sizes, yes, I find it frustrating too to put a small chair in my plan and, when moving it around the room, it somehow decides to increase in size and I can't decrease it. Plus, I'd like to have smaller things in the room sometimes than 2"" and nothing in the menu is less than 2"". But it's not that big a deal.In general, I really enjoy playing around with this program. I don't really understand one reviewers complaint about saving with a ""watermark"" (the only free way to save). I haven't personally found that to be a problem. My guess is? Simply that there is no privacy on a wifi type device and these free programs. Again, what do you expect? My plans aren't copyrighted but, frankly, why exactly would I care? I'm not an architect and these are just basic sketches of possible floor plans. If they were ever built, I could care less if someone ""stole"" them. One section is my idea for ""homeless"" cabins. Steel ALL you want as long as you help the homeless out. Great idea!Have fun and you will enjoy. Think it's private or professional or perfect and you will be disappointed."
self direction,Great and easy to follow,"This is a great, simple way to make floor plans to give you an idea of how you would like walls placed.  We are interested in creating living space in our basement and this is coming in very handy for that."
stimulation,"I was skeptical when I saw the rating, but this is exactly what I needed","I want to move some things around in the upstairs level of my home. Trying to figure out a good way to have to scale rooms and objects to manipulate would be a challenge on paper and since this isn't something for a commercial need, I didn't want to invest in some expensive software I can't easily figure out.  This app does the trick wonderfully!  I was able to take measurements of my rooms and easily create appropriate sized rooms ad shapes with the app. Then, I moved them around to see what I could arrange where and this will afford me the ability not only to rearrange but add some things from other areas of the house where I didn't really want them (like the rower in my living room)!  The app has the ability to survey your room to some extent with your camera, but I found the creation tool to be plenty easy and intuitive, so I didn't even attempt that.  The main things I could see improvements on are objects and layers. I'd like some things to sit behind others and I don't think that's possible with the ones I'm working with right now. The size restrictions on certain things is tough too. Like my platform bed has an edge around it and the app would not let me increase to the size I need, so I had to add on a rectangle to properly depict the size.  It would be nice for more object or custom ones that have general shapes or a polygon tool to set up a certain #of side and define their lengths."
power,a good app. A little hard to control dimensions,"Overall, a good app.  A little hard to control dimensions, especially down to 1/4 inch."
self direction,Two Stars,Doesn't work how I thought it would
self direction,The best app . . . and free!  Simple to learn.,"This does exactly what you want if that is total freedom to design your own floor plan from scratch. So much less limiting than other so-called floor plan apps which pre-determine elements for you. I have this on my Kindle Fire and Samsung Galaxy tab 3. I spent too much time trying to figure out how to update my Kindle's version (lots of improvements since then) before I thought to look up the app from the Kindle app store. That's when I saw the update button, where it would usually say ""install."" It would make sense for there to be an update option in the actual app. Love the new menu options.  Things I would love to see: 1. Better chair choices. The small chair now gets longer to make a bench, but not deeper. The sofa can shrink also, but again, only lengthwise; not enough to qualify as a desk chair, especially with those fat arms. So, maybe a mid-sized chair?  2. It drives me crazy to keep trying to layer menu items, such as an upper cabinet over a lower, or a lamp over a table, only to have them reverse positions. Thanks for the fun app!"
power,"Has a lot to offer, I don't recommend for Kindle",Hard to control on Kindle HDX .  May be better on computer
self direction,One Star,Wasn't what I thought it was.
self direction,not too good,"It really wasn't all that great. I thought it could have had better layouts, and it was a bit confusing."
self direction,Somewhat complicated useage,Not as easy to use as I thought. I may end up deleting it.
self direction,"Great, wish there could be more things","This app is really great for creating rooms. I would give this 5 stars if they had more furniture, like bookshelves or things for a backyard. Great app though!"
power,Maybe for a Tablet?,"I installed this on my DroidX.  Forget it.  To small to create with finger control.  Maybe better on a 8 or 10"" tablet?"
self direction,pretty fun,"This app is really cool. But you need youtube player to watch the tutorial video. It takes time to figure out how to do things. It's really fun  though. Creating walls and furniture and new rooms, it's addicting."
self direction,ok,Have not tried this app just yet but still have it on my kindle.  I am sure it won't be exactly as I thought it to be but sure it will be interesting none the less.
self direction,Basic Program,Basic program works as I thought it would and seems like it will be a helpful tool for my home work.
universalism,5 people found this helpful,"Downloaded the app, went straight to designing a floor plan of our home and within 15 minutes had produced exactly that.For a free app this is very good, I will after further use, seriously consider purchasing and supporting the developers.Whilst I am no Cad technician I do have very basic understanding of cad systems which may be why it was so easy to pick up and use out of the box, but I am sure a layman after following the instructions and an hour having a hands on work out will find it very easy and will find many uses when planning home DIY...... I plan on using it to plot cad variations/discrepancies in my job as a shop fit project manger for a well known world wide retailer, should I be caught off duty without the usual tablet/laptop.Great Work"
self direction,6 people found this helpful,"Excellent application - we have been using it to draw up a floor plan in preparation for selling our house, and the integration with our Bosch PLC laser distance meter is really good. Draw a rough outline with all the bits of nooky-cranny wall you've got in a room, tell it to measure, and it shows an outline for each wall to measure, you use the laser meter to do the readings and it adjusts the floor plan of that room for you. Super easy, well put together.A small gripe is the stairs. It is difficult to see on the plans whether a set of stairs are emerging from the floor underneath, or going up to the level above. Be very useful to be able to mark this in some way (i know there are conventions for doing this on floor plans with estate agents and whatnot, and while i realise that be different in the 3D mode, being able to mark this somehow on the 2D plan other than just adding a label would be good).As a suggestion for improvement: Being able to select a bunch of bits and creating a new level out of them would be very useful (as well as selecting multiple bits and moving them around). Ran into this because i was a silly person who made the entire plan on one level before realising that wasn't possible, which turned what i thought would be convenient into something that was less so ;) My fault for not checking, but i think it'd be useful anyway.And a useful actually-new-feature for our purpose specifically: Being able to do ground plans, not just floor plans. We have an unusual layout outside our house, which i wanted to draw a plan of as well, but this app only does internal layouts. As it is called ""Floor Plan Creator"" though, it is understandable that an arguably tangential feature like something that is outside of a house isn't included, but again, thought it might be good for the author to know the desire for the feature exists :)"
power,Very basic,"Too basic, I want more printed controls."
self direction,PrintBot for Kindle,I choose this APP for my Kindle because I thought it would work for my application to print emails and other info from the WEB.This APP would not work on my PRINTER. We have a HP WIRELESS Printer. Model did not show up under printer types. I tried to print to my  I.P. address  and HPEPRINT but would not print. This APP might work for some other printer. This is why my STAR rating was a 3. This might work with a number but not ours Thanks.
self direction,didn't work........,"Thought it was going to work when it found my Brother printer, but it never connected to it.  It didn't list my model.  I tried other Brother models but still did not connect. (MFC-490CW) ?  Evidently works for others, just not for me.  Deleting"
self direction,Used it once,Thought it would be a good idea to print from my Kindle when I sitting down browsing.  I reality I have used it once so OK I suppose.
self direction,ditched the Kodak,"Only just bought it but so far so good, sets up very easy and looks good although not as small as i thought it would be."
self direction,Promising start but didn't actually work!,"Set up easily or so I thought, it confidently told me that my document was printing and then that my document was successfully printed...no it wasn't... Nothing actually happened tried a number of different settings but no joy, so could only give it one star for the ease of set up for a Kodak printer.  But disappointed for its failure to work, will be uninstalling."
self direction,Easy monitoring,"I started off with the free app of this and upgraded to the paid version (which is a great price!).  It enables listening and talking.The App works great.  I have a couple of Foscam wireless webcams and this program works great.  Can easily view, move, listen, talk to the camera.Overall, it's a bargain for the price, because the Foscam web interface is poorly designed.The only hiccup I've found is that if you don't ""Back"" out of the program to close it on the Kindle (press back button to close rather than just pressing Home button) it may keep running.  I've had my kindle cover closed and the Kindle off (so I thought) and heard sound coming from it which was this App still monitoring a room.  This will then run down your battery."
power,EASY TO SET UP!!!  good control,"I was pleasantly surprised how good this free version is.  I can point the camera by tilting my kindle fire the same way I would do if I were tilting my head.  Have to invert controls to do it, which is an easy setting to change.  Load multiple cameras on one screen.  I couldn't get the manufacturers software to work on my phone (foscam on evo 4g), but this does!"
power,Great Camera Monitor App,"Quick and easy installation on my Motorola Android phones and my Airpad. Gives me great control over my HooToo IPCam Plus other IPCams. It's easy to add cameras and you can always upgrade for additional features. My only con is not being able to delete a single camera, it's all or nothing. Tiny Solutions LLC have done a great job on this app. I will probably purchase the pro version in order to get the full audio package but if you're only interested in video this is the app for you."
power,"Nice, but app a little buggy","Pro:I can display several cameras at once and see a realtime display from them all at the same time, something my stock camera app won't do.Con:Among others, I have 2 Wyze cameras.  I have 1 fixed camera and 1 camera with pan/tilt/zoom (PTZ).  App constantly confuses which is which, resulting in my loss of ability to control the pan/tilt of the camera with PTZ because the app thinks that is the fixed one.  I've removed and re-added the cameras multiple times in different orders to try and fix this, but it keeps happening."
power,I wish that I had some navigation controlling when I ...,"I wish that I had some navigation controlling when I touch the radio button.  It seems to just do it thing.  The old tiny camera, I was able to control the navigating of the video camera when I want to view the room."
power,Only one that works,Have tried several Foscam viewers and non have worked on the G5 over https. Only reason for 4 stars is that can not control pan and tilt. Have a F19821w with 2.1 firmware. Great app
power,Great application - ended up upgrading to the Pro version,This is a great application for controlling my Foscam FI8910W camera.  I liked the features in this free version so much that I upgraded to the Pro version!Highly recommend!
power,Works great,"Very easy and just what I need to watch my dogs when I'm traveling.  You can watch up to 14 cameras at once, I only have 3.  I can control the cameras, zoom in, pan, etc"
security,Haven't fully utilized,Downloaded for use with WyzeCam and it added stability to a problematic camera. It does much more that I don't use.
security,Works well but get the pro version if you plan to have more than one cam.,Got this to try out with the newsecurity camera.  Ended up getting the pro version because it worked well as a trial.
security,"Handy Camera App, but a bit complicated in setup","Very useful app for getting a handle on one or moresecurity cameras. I'd give it 5 stars but it can be a bit complicated to get everything working right. Very specific in what it needs in the way of information, but it does not give very clear instructions on just how to do it. Seems to be more of an intermediate skill set tool than beginner. I did, however, figure it out through trial and error. Fortunately, after you set one camera up, you are good to go from then on, knowledge wise."
power,Great Cam App!,The Free tinyCam Monitor works great with my Foscam FI8910W units.  The performance is similar to the Foscam Monitor Android app for multi-camera operation. TinyCam does not allow speaker or microphone operation or pan/tilt control.  But that may be a feature of the paid version.  It works with dynamic DNS for Internet access as well.  If you set your units up this way be sure to change your units default user Id's and pass-codes.
power,Free version has features,Free version has the overall features to see your cams from Intranet (at home network) and Internet. Proversion has more controls if some of your cams need adjustment or repositioning.

This happened 2 days ago and waiting for replacment.  This transaction is through mfg. Not Amazon"

power,Controls cams from remote locations - do not pay attention to bad reviews,"this app is excellent. It does control my 3 Foscam cameras. It also controls an old Android phone camera I have set up. It does control pan and tilt functions. you can view and control your cameras from your Android phone or tablet from a remote location,either using wifi or 4g. To do this, you must use the external IP address of your router. You can also view your cameras from your own internal network while you are at home connected to your own WiFi network. The individuals who claim they cannot view their cameras from their phone do not understand how to set up external and internal IP cameras."

security,50/50,Although I am late in writing this review I have to say even though the quality for a small screen is very good. The trouble that we have been having to this day is that we have only ever been able to rig up one camara.

self direction,Useless on Amazon Kindle,"Installed an uninstalled o.k. I don't like that I can't review after I've uninstalled (Amazon please fix that). First screen was an ad for Facebook, x'ing out of that brought me to a screen to check my wireless connection, connection was verified after hitting start but closing the wireless information screen brought me back to the page asking me to hit start. No further action is possible.  Worthless for the Kindle Fire until they fix that."
self direction,Don't work as good as it shows on advert,"It wasn't what I thought it would be ,my husband has sight problems but it did not help."
self direction,SO slow to load! Cancelled subscription,"I wanted to like this channel...  loved the theory behind it.... and my dogs seem to watch Ã¢??humanÃ¢?Â TV while we are watching so I thought it would be a success... but the performance of this channel/app was so frustrating. The latency was more than my patience could handle. I would stand there for 5 minutes waiting for it to load so that I could select the right option within the channel... when IÃ¢??m running out the door for work, I donÃ¢??t want to wait 5 minutes to turn on the TV for my dogs. Clean up the performance, Dog TV. Note: we have a new smart TV and do not have latency issues with ANY other app/channel we use. This IS a DogTV issue and we cancelled our subscription"
self direction,Depends on the dog,"I have a 10 month old Siberian Husky who already enjoys watching TV whether it's Animal Planet, National Geographic Wild or even a football game. In the right mood, she will watch any TV program, especially one featuring animals or dogs with a surprising amount of focus. We downloaded this app at about 2:30am on our Fire TV and woke her up from a pretty deep sleep just to see if it interested her. She watched for about 15 minutes straight until we made her go upstairs for bed (and turned it on up there).A lot of the negative reviews tend be from people's who's dog didn't care too much or that were having issues with the stream a couple years ago. From the hour or so we've had it on it works perfectly fine and offers on demand selections as well as live programming that fits the time of day. My dog personally couldn't take her eyes off thestimulation video and relaxation video we played when we first got it. The content certainly seems dog orientated which is neat. Lots of dogs eye view of everyday life, various dog clips, and relaxing scenery. I won't lie though, the overnight program is trippy but I guess if it works for dogs, it works. Certainly not made for human enjoyment though to be honest, I find it very interesting and find myself watching just to see what's next.If your dog already likes watching TV, they should like this. If not, they may not. But the service is what it is so I wouldn't be discouraged by the people leaving one star reviews just because their dog didn't care for it or because they thought a channel scientifically designed for dogs would interest them too."
universalism,Good for dogs who stay home alone,"I started to leave this on for my dog during the day while I'm at work as an experiment. When I come home she seems a lot more relaxed. This channel plays videos of dogs sleeping, playing, etc. And pairs them with familiar noises and nature sounds (squeak toys, happy voices, wind chimes, leaves falling, ocean waves) I don't know if I'm crazy but it seems to really work!"
universalism,Miss-  provide better examples,I reviewed the free clips however none seemed to be what your dog would see if you subscribed-  per descriptions /examples of color- sound- etc. meant for the dogs viewing time.I had my dog with me & tried to interest her-  (sheÃ¢??s 1 year Shepard mix - intelligent & curious by natureÃ¢??-)  the free clips did not stir her interest in the least.  I couldnÃ¢??t get her to do more than glance at it-  then look away-I played them several times hoping sheÃ¢??s engage but no interest.Perhaps because these are the clips meant for humans-  not dogs.I Recco allowing a couple short clips meant for the dogs viewing-  as I surely wonÃ¢??t purchase based on our experience so far.Neat idea-  but nothing there to see what our best friend thinks about it in fairness.
universalism,"App needs a lot of work, not user friendly","I wanted to like this service.  But it was glitchy, hard to understand the app to get it to work.  Multiple clicks to try to get the sections to activate.  IÃ¢??m no slouch to understanding the works of most apps and services, but this one was pretty bad and unresponsive.  Maybe I should have asked my Border Collie.  I cancelled the service.  Maybe when they get their app working properly I might try again."
security,"Great, but needs IT to fix the bugs.","Our dog loves Dog TV but it stops and buffers all the time and if you are not there with the remote to start it, then it's no use.  If we leave it on when we have to leave our dog home alone, we can check oursecurity camera and it is always stopped within 10 or 15 minutes of us leaving.  It's not our internet since it doesn't do that when we watch a movie or binge watch a show.  Dog TV needs to fix the problem  or we will cancel."
security,No longer unstable AF,"My dog and I like the app. I even purchased an annual subscription. The problem is that it only plays a few minutes at a time before crashing. I've cleared the cache, I've cleared the data, I've uninstalled and reinstalled, I've signed out and back in, and I've done every combination of the above. Nothing works. Fix the stability and I will gladly change my rating.*updated review - - They fixed it."
self direction,My dog seemed to lose interest,"At first I thought this was a great idea and my dog seemed to actually watch it. She wasn't one to ever notice the TV, so I thought this was going to be great. I put it on two TVs when I went to work and every time I wold peak in on the cameras she was in a different room looking out the window.I definitely think it is made for them and grabs their attention, I guess my dog just prefers to wait for the mailman or Amazon man rather than watch TV."
self direction,They wonÃ¢??t cancel despite my request!,"What I thought would be a great idea to keep my pooch company, turns out my dog is terrified by the images on DOGTV and despite my written attempts to cancel, they keep billing. I even get billed TWO TIMES EVERY MONTH because I accidentally clicked the purchase button twice. I am beyond frustrated and only now realized thereÃ¢??s this review function. It might be good for somebodyÃ¢??s pet, but not mine. All IÃ¢??ve received is acknowledgement of my request, no follow through. I donÃ¢??t have $20 each month to throw away as IÃ¢??ve never turned DOGTV on after the first day. Bummer."
self direction,Looking and listening to what is in this app,"I thought it would be a free channel so my dogs would feel comfortable when we leave to go someplace.  I didnÃ¢??t think it was worth it, I did even get a sample of what to expect."
stimulation,Humans and Dogs Enjoy Dog TV,My dogs enjoy watching and/or listening to Dog TV.  I put on their channel whenever I leave them home alone.  We also watch it together to get away from regular tv and all the conflict in the world these days.  I find it quite relaxing!  The Dog TV Challenge gave me interesting tips on getting my dogs to be more engaged in their programming.
self direction,.....Would be great if these dog shows were really free.,"......I thought they were free, but you must pay for this service.......My dog could watch hours of free dog  videos on ""You Tube "" for free."
self direction,"Abysmally Bad, Limited, Uninteresting Content",Terrible. Paid for a one month subscription and cancelled. Extremely limited content.- I honestly thought this could not possibly be the content.  My dog was not the least bit interested and the repetitive music just annoyed me. Absolutely not worth the subscription fee.
self direction,Great distraction for bored dogs,My dog enjoys the distraction of pleasant sounds featuring dogs & children while I am work during the day.
self direction,Surprise cost,"I thought this was supposed to be free with Amazon Prime not just 30 days free.  They then start billing after the first few days.  This gets annoying, I thought I'd try one again to see if it's gotten any better but sadly, it hasn't.  Too bad because it looked like something pretty cool.  I don't understand why Prime is supposed to have  free stuff for it's members yet it charges monthly fees for everything."
self direction,Not what I expected,Thought be fun to put it on for my dog as some of my friend said their dogs enjoyed it ..... He was not interested.
self direction,Not what I expected. But relaxing to fall asleep to!,"Not exactly what I thought it would be, I was hoping for more ""shows"" for dogs and longer than 30 minute shows or music, especially for the separation anxiety, my dogs didn't really care too much for it. But I enjoyed the music to sleep too lol!"
self direction,Cute!,"My dogs werenÃ¢??t thrilled with it but it is soothing to watch, well, I thought so lol"
stimulation,it seemed like a so-so product,"Damn if I can ever get this working, I have added it to cable and to my Firestick. I work in IT support, I pity the person that is ""tech challenged"" and dare attempts to make this consistently work. The few times it did, it seemed like a so-so product."
self direction,Too expensive,I thought it would at least offer some free options. Nope. It's too expensive and I have no problem usually dropping some coin for my girl.
self direction,Pawfect! Needs more action.,The videos are centered more around tranquility. I would like to see more action. My puppy wants to play.I bought the app so my dogs would be entertained while I work from home. I canÃ¢??t be playing while I need to work. IÃ¢??m not convinced itÃ¢??s worth $9.99 a month yet.
self direction,Not free,I thought it was free but it's not.
self direction,Not impdess,Thought it was a channel FOR dogs.  Wasn't interesting for dog parent either.
self direction,Stupidest thing ever!,I thought this was a joke but it wasn't couldn't believe it.
self direction,Did not realize this was a paid TV app,"I thought the app was free, but there is a monthly fee"
self direction,Playback error defeats the purpose,"Dogs LOVE it. However ... have been experiencing ""playback error"" for the past week-ish. Defeats the purpose of all day distraction. Sofa paid the price."
self direction,What a great idea.,I enjoyed it but my girl Gracie didn't take to it. I tried to get her to sit with me but she had a ear infection and really didn't like it when I would flush em and I think she thought that I would try to flush
self direction,Seriously.,"This is absurd, but I wish IÃ¢??d thought of it so I could charge humans for this nonsense. Zero intention of actually subscribing. My dog rolled his eyes and went back to licking and watching stuff that was free."
self direction,Not for me,Was pleasantly surprised when i came across this app and thought it would be great for our pups while we're away.  Then i needed to pay to activate it.  Why would i pay a monthly subscription for this to be a baby(dog)sitter.  Nuts!!!!  I just deleted the app and moved on.
self direction,A waste of time and money!,A sorry excuse for an app. Very limited programming  and my dogs  showed no interest in watching it and no reaction to listening to it.
self direction,Not for every dog,Thought it would be a good idea it made my dog anxious.
self direction,Dog didnÃ¢??t care,Dog did not like. No action just colors and sound
self direction,My dog loves it!,"My dog LOVES DogTV. I thought there was no way a dog would watch TV, but sometimes when heÃ¢??s a little rambunctious at home, I turn it on. He sits and watches it!"
self direction,Stupid,Just videos of dogs.... not at all what I thought it would be q complete waste of my time would definitely never pay for it
self direction,Wont use it.,I thought it was free.
self direction,Not what was expected,DidnÃ¢??t like it wasnÃ¢??t what I thought it would be.
self direction,There's nothing here...,There was only like 3 minutes worth of free programming and it was just previews of the regular programming. And some videos about dog adoption. Everything else comes with the $9.99 monthly fee. I thought it would have lots of programs for dogs but it would been nice to know how limiting it was before downloading.
self direction,Just a Trial.  Don't waste your time.,Hated the trial trick.  You only get am extremely short trial loop. Everything else paid for by a micro transaction process. A waste of time.
self direction,One Star,I thought it was free!  In any case too expensive ...
self direction,The service is completely unreliable!,"When I try to log in, I continuously receive an error message. IÃ¢??ve tried creating a new account and changing my password. I am able to access the app from my iPhone, but have problems streaming from my TV. The support at Dog TV was wholly inadequate."

self direction,Not perfect,"As reported previously, no audioNot a problem if you have a Bluetooth speakerHowever, as also reported, the video lags, creating image distortion and audio lag which is not a problem for short videos but would be hell if trying to view a movie or other lengthy videoOverall, mehIt did what I wanted"

self direction,I have no reasonable input,"My daughter downloaded this.. I have had zero interactions with it, other than writing this review, which I felt compelled to write."
