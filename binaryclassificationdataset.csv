Useless. I was unable to make the simplest edit to my PDF. Wish I could get my money back but Amazon makes it impossible.,Yes
I installed this app and that's as far as I got. Every time I tried to open it it would crash then tell me an unknown error occurred. Uninstalled and reinstalled a few times but never got it to even open.  Can't say if I liked it or not because I never got to try it.,Yes
"Found it difficult to use, and I think I can't make an account",Yes
i use this quite often. We need the update verion because save buttton is not working. And also the layout is bothering me.,Yes
"If I could give it less stars, I would Does not work on Samsung Galaxy Note 8. Email to developer does not work. Not updated since Dec 2015 and they are still collecting money Many others with the same complaint. If you risk buying this program, I'd recommend trying to email the developer first to ensure you can get support in case it doesn't work. Otherwise, avoid this product.",Yes
"I got a new tablet with Marshmallow.  Apparently the app has been abandoned, because I get ""invalid file"" every time I try to read a file into the app.  This is not just a tablet problem, because I just checked my phone that has Marshmallow, and that also gives the same message.i think it will not work for me anymore.",Yes
"App doesn't work. It hasn't for the longest time, over 12 months. Not maintained by developer and no response to crash reports. Invalid email and no WEB SITE. I'm on Android 8.0 Oreo on HTC 10 unlocked. Been over 12 months I tried, gave it a chance with new update to OS.. no luck, it still sucks. UNINSTALL ASAP. i think it will not work for me in the future also",Yes
Continuously crashes. Cannot open even after restarts. No way to receive refund. Update to report one problem I have found. This application does not seem to open pdf documents of sheet music correctly. Had similar issues with other apps as well (Adobe app works). Other than that I am still happy with the performance of this app.crashed,Yes
"Opens .pdf documents way faster than the Adobe app, and more functional as well. This is a must have app if you deal with .pdf documents at all. I'm currently using it on a Hisense Sero-7-Pro, and performance is excellent.EDIT: Update to report one problem I have found. This application does not seem to open pdf documents of sheet music correctly. Had similar issues with other apps as well (Adobe app works). Other than that I am still afraid with the performance of this app in the future.",Yes
"Like others, I began receiving the ""invalid file"" message when attempting to open any pdf file with PDF Max Pro after upgrading to Marshmallow. I recently upgraded to crying and sadly the issue persists. What was once a very useful app now serves no purpose whatsoever. I guess I finally need to give up hope and uninstall it. Time of death March 4, 2017 11:39.",Yes
DO NOT WASTE YOUR 4.00. APP DOESN'T EVEN OPEN. Why is there no refund option like on regular Android devices. SCAM,Yes
"I dont  like a lot of the features. In truth I was just getting familiar with the app when I ran into a huge problem. It won't run without internet access. Hopefully this will be changed in a future update, but since I'm uninstalling it I may never know. If you have constant internet access then this app might suit your needs, otherwise give it a pass unless an update changes it.",Yes
Never opens and will not open any pdfs.  Waste of money.  Please remove this app from the AppStore,Yes
"Adding strikethrough or underline to a document repeatedly gives ""Unfortunately, PDF Max has stopped.""Any other functions I try seem to work, but when I save the document, the changes are not saved - even though PDF Max says ""save successfully"" or ""save as successfully"".Nice concept, but not worth using if the changes are not saved and not working ",Yes
"I find this little app very easy to use. However, I have a major issue with it on my galaxy tab S. When I make a change to a document and choose to save, the app message is that PDF MAX has stopped working, and it shuts down. I was able to use the stamp feature to insert an image and save that.  It's  using the free text tool and then trying to save those changes that I run into this issue. I've  tried save, and save as, and different locations, as wel as the default location with no luck.not work",Yes
It is impossible to use this app. There seems to be no way to navigate to where my documents are. A total scan and waste of money,Yes
It won't open at all. I want a refund. downloaded and deleted because I faces problem in the dificult  layout. No working,Yes
"I like this app's features.  Pretty handy to have for modifying PDF files.  But I don't understand why the latest update requires reading users identities? Until I understand the purpose of the requirement or they take it away.  Only 2 worthy to me,  sorry.its bothering me",Yes
Dont work Trash My money  back I can't return.,Yes
I just paid to download this. Not working. It shuts off when I open a Pdf file. :( waste of money,Yes
"For 8, I had expected more. Maybe it is the operating system (Android), but this is a poor product. Many free ones that are similar and even better.Don't waste your money.  Also my old windows tablet and phone have better PDF apps",Yes
"Can't use at all.  App crashes as soon as file is opened.  It's crap.  Plus, there's no way to get support.  No help file.",Yes
I just downloaded this and immediately it doesn't work.,Yes
I should have believed the reviews. Crashes on everything that I try to open. Waste of money. Big disappointment,Yes
"In the Evernote app, for Android, click on a PDF attachment and - ugh PDF Max 4 replies it's an ""invalid file"". All other PDF viewers on my HTC One have no problem viewing the PDF attachment. So, PDF Max 4 is now uninstalled.",Yes
"It says it has saved but then I go back in and my highlights and underlines are gone. It asked if I wanted to ""back up"" I said yes and it doesn't appear to have done anything. A few seconds later the app ""encountered a problem"" and forced close on me :(",Yes
"this app doesnt work well in my kindle, I had to uninstall it immediately I wasted my money",Yes
"This app does not seem to work with all PDF files. I've never had problems with Adobe Reader. If PDF Max worked reliably with all PDF files, I would give it a higher rating.",Yes
Crashes every single time. Need a refund asap. waste of time using this app ,Yes
I recently purchased this app for my Kindle Fire.  Where would I find instructions?  Also Erase doesn't work.  I typed in something and now I am stuck with it.  How to I remove something I typed?  Useless if I can't erase....,Yes
Don't waste your money.  It doesn't work at all.This app does not seem to work with all PDF files,Yes
This app doesn't seem to want to work well with the Samsung Tablet I have..... I can't really judge the app since my tablet would not let it run,Yes
Continually crashes as soon as I try to open a file.  Developer cannot be contacted.  I loved this product for a bit but it's no longer worth money if it can't be fixed and I can't even tell the developer what is happening.  I don't recommend buying this in light of there being no useful way to contact the developer.,Yes
"This is the weakest of the pdf apps I've tried, and most expensive. I expected for the money to get more functionality. Instead it has less. You can't even resize text annotations-how stupid. Don't waste your money.",Yes
"Doesn't open PDFs, doesn't work, don't waste your money. 0 stars don't recommend",Yes
"This app is useless since it will not connect to any Cloud service to import documents.  Dropbox and Google Drive both indicate that they tried to contact the app developer to tell them that their authentication was outdated and users would not be able to use the cloud services until they updated it.  Who knows how long ago that was.  In the technology world, this is business suicide. I made the mistake of paying for this app and it doesn't even work for what I need it for.  So don't waste your money.  Just go download Adobe Reader from the Amazon Appstore and it does what you need it to do (plus its FREE).",Yes
"The application has several interface problems and is not usable for my main type of annotations using free text. Hard to add, edit, reposition free text. With fast typing, the app cant catch up and letters disappear. Removing annotations is painful. Many other usability issues. I recommend professional usability testing. Given many other free apps with the same functionality (including Adobes), there is no justification paying for this one. Hope, future versions will do a better job.",Yes
Not a bad application bit I can not find a way to contact the developer to report an issue. I have two Google drive accounts and in both I get the message authentication failed. .. There is some kind of bug. No problem with the other cloud services. I wish copy could be added in the cloud services.,Yes
This app doesn't work with Dropbox (or any cloud service as far as I'm aware) which makes it totally useless. I wasted 4.,Yes
"I have a lot of problema with it, the app crashes repeatedly on mi Kindle fire hd.",Yes
App doesn't work properly on my Kindle Fire HDX.  When first installed it worked.  After I closed & reopened the app it stopped working..  When I open a document it closes the app.  Uninstall & reinstall made no difference.,Yes
"Every time I attempt to open a PDF file, I receive an *invalid file* notice, and then the app immediately closes. Call me crazy, but I'm pretty sure PDFs are what this app is made for. I have tried multiple PDF files, all with the same results. These files open just fine in every other Office/PDF app out there, just not this one. I have even uninstalled and then reinstalled twice, with no luck. I have tried contacting customer support, but have not received a reply. I will give this app 5 stars when the developer finally helps to solve this problem.",Yes
Bought it. Won't open any PDF. Waste of my money.,Yes
"I have tried a few different PDF readers, and I believe that this one is superior. The documents load quickly and easily. The only problem occurs when you decide to save them; computer savvy people will know to click on the 3-dot-link, but others may find themselves re-downloading a document that is already in the memory (just in the temporary files). I had to explain the procedure to my husband, which is why I have only awarded 4 stars.",Yes
"not what i expected , dont waste your time on it",Yes
I can't seem to figure out how to close the PDFs once they are open.  The file menu has everything but close exit quit or load.  I guess it's fortunate that there are so many crashes. Completely unstable in its current state for Kindle HDX. Got the app for free in a kindle Appstore sale.,Yes
"1. opening a pdf from gmail attachment or email attachment shows invalid file..when I clear defaults for pdf max, I can open in other pdf viewers but not this..2. can't edit pdf like delete pages of add pages or add files...",Yes
"it doesn't work on toshiba thrive, slow at start, some pdfs won't openyou can't beat MuPDFthis might useful to edit, but it won't open some of my docs. i removed it",Yes
Unable to reload purchased copy after factory restore to fix root problem,Yes
still some problem and Won't open up my PDF,Yes
Program doesn't work.  Contact with company through email an website failed.,Yes
Device used: Galaxy Note 3.I was unable to fully try out the app. I could not select and annotate the first page easily. Every time I try to edit the annotation I can only see page 2. Then I couldn't see page one. Scrolling didn't work. Using a stylus doesn't help.,Yes
"not Easy to use.I was unable to make the simplest edit to my PDF, I don’t think it will work for me ",Yes
"Installed 1st on my moto g and it worked. But doesn't work on my tablet, LG GPad where i would use it. Unfortunately pdfmax has stopped.That's the error i get. And i don't even need to open any pdf.If i browse using my explorer or pdf max i get this error.",Yes
there are too many PDF files that this app can't open that others can.,Yes
"Crashes constantly and corrupts my files regularly. Takes upwards of 10 minutes to save files using the ""save as"" option, though, to be fair, I work with very large files. I lost over 400 pages of work thanks to crash on this thing. Don't waste your money, don't waste your time.",Yes
Crashes continually on my kindle fire.  Can't use it.,Yes
Purchased it and a waste of money. Kicks me out of the app when I try to open a file.,Yes
"While opening a PDF file in my Nexus 7 (2013-Wifi Only Tablet) , the original Font style of that PDF file changed The file doesn't appear in its Original form. Ultimately, reading becomes pathetic. This problem doesn't exist in my Uncle's Samsung Galaxy E7 smartphone. This app is functioning there normally. Please Fix this issue at the earliest.",Yes
It doesn't work with my galaxy note 10.1,Yes
"The latest update has rendered the auto-open function of this app unusable. When opening a pdf from an email etc, the app shows an error: ""Invalid File"". If the pdf file is opened from inside the app, it works well. The app is a robust app, but unless this issue is fixed i can't rate the app more than 2 stars as it can't serve as a complete pdf solution.",Yes
Crashes when opening. Waste of money,Yes
"It does NOT work, rubbish. Crashes when opening. Waste of money",Yes
It just doesn't work :( Crashes when opening. Waste of money,Yes
"sorry got this by mistake, Crashes when opening. Waste of money",Yes
Waste of Time came as a free download can't get rid of it,Yes
"Waste of time. Keeps crashing, so any annotations you've made are lost.",Yes
Waste of time for me...but it's free so judge it yourself.,Yes
I was unable to figure out how to use,Yes
Fun way to connect with my granddaughter.I was unable to figure out how to use,Yes
Didn't work and Waste of time. Never worked consistently,Yes
I can't delete it bc it's says install but I can still u the app,Yes
Never worked consistently.Can't get it to work.,Yes
Can't get it to work. too many random text came through.  I already deleted it.,Yes
Awesomesauce when you have wifi.I was unable to figure out how to use,Yes
"Its so frustrating, constantly signing me out, making me sign back in just to erase all of my previous messages including new ones that I have just received an  haven't gotten to read. And now all it shows me when I open the app is a text that's sending, that I sent yesterday morning and wont let me do anything else. I have ran the repair app tool multiple times and contacted customer service for the issues. This app is being un installed. So annoying to deal with just to send texts. Not worth it.",Yes
"I might need this for 2-step verification. So I chose the ""free"" app. But that's a lie. It's not free. To get a single text, it's 4. That's not nearly free. That's a ripoff. I could go to a dollar store and get a burner phone for ten dollars per month and get unlimited texts. But I don't want a cell phone. I suppose in the days of two-step verifications, that means I won't be able to function online any more. I certainly won't choose to deal with a company that lies about its price. That should not be allowed, and Amazon should remove their app from the Fire store. False advertising is wrong. Poor value is wrong. I have no idea why there are positive reviews here. All paid for, I assume.",Yes
"This app does not even open for me.  Just says ""TextMe has stopped working"" - and I haven't even been able to send a text from it.  That's as far as the download went.  Terrific   It doesn't deserve even one star.",Yes
"Can't get a ringtone on Kindle., so I don't know when somebody is calling. Maybe this is the reason that I don’t like it ",Yes
I've been using this app to text on a Kindle Fire for several months with no major issues. Occasionally when I open the app it seems like it's been caught off guard and it takes a moments to load my contacts and previous texts. None of my contacts or  texts have been lost.I have not used the app to make calls.,Yes
"You shouldn't have changed it because it was way better before, I Loved it but now the ubdate won't work I can't even get a new number because I had to delete it.it showing too much ads please fix it ",Yes
I had it for a year but the new update doesn't work it just loads for hours. I just hope I don't lose my number. Again,Yes
"Please help It's telling me my number is expired and showing ads but when I try to pay for the monthly unlimited upgrade (again) Amazon says I'm already subscribed. Therefore I'm stuck. Unable to make a call. Unable to use my number. And the worst part is, this isn't the first time it's happened to me. Last time, I had to delete my number and get a whole  new one. Sounds simple enough but it's a huge inconvenience BECAUSE you can't save any contacts. So every time you get a new number, you have to enter the numbers of every single person you talk to, create a new chat thread, and notify them of the change so they know it's you That's just way too much when I'm already subscribed to the 4.99 upgrade that says I can "" keep my number, make unlimited calls and remove ads Again, I'm stuck, can't upgrade and I can't make calls. Extremely Frustrated. Please fix the issue causing this to happen.",Yes
I have had for two months and all of the sudden I am unable to send texts at all. Contacted support and they can't seem to help either.,Yes
"I got this thinking that it was a way to access my normal texts on my fire tablet.  Instead, it gives you a new phone number.  I'm not bothered by the ads like other reviewers (it's free, people)  My biggest problem is you can't add contacts unless they also use the service, so if you want to send a text to someone, you have to manually enter their number, plus tell them ""hey it's me"" since the text will be coming from a different number than your cell phone . It's pretty useless.  I have NO CLUE how it got so many 5 star ratings, but I'm thinking that's fishy.",Yes
"Rip off rip off rip off, even though it's free, try to do the offers no reward just a waste of time. Plus it's full of glitches and slows down my os. DO NOT DOWNLOAD Virus haven.",Yes
Only issue is you need WiFi for it to work. Saves a cell phone bill for people with limited finances.,Yes
"unable to log in, effectively change password, or manage account",Yes
Its cool just needs unlimited calling.Maybe this is the reason that I don’t like it ,Yes
Text me dose not let me call can't put names on the tags to who you are texting I have to use phone number but I can at least text,Yes
"You can't just make a contact, or even have their name saved.  You just sit there texting (902)109-0210.  I mean yeah it's free, but remember they collect ALL your data",Yes
"Can't login, always sends me back to login screen or program crashes/closes.  Pretty funny for a program made for Kindle.",Yes
"It works-ish.  You can call and text, but you have to watch TONS of ads.  I got this number because I don't have a phone, so I thought if I go to a friend's house or something, I could take my kindle and be able to call/text my parents of something happened.  WRONG.  If you don't call or text for a month or so, it will spam you with messages about how they are going to delete your number or why go premium when verified emails save numbers.  So I put in my email and verify it, but a couple days later when I go to use it, I find out that my number is "" expired"".  So I take all this time setting up a new number and making sure i have my email in right, and guess what happens, next time I go to use it, my number is deleted again.  So yes it does call and text for free, but if you aren't going to use it often or pay them a bunch of money, you will have to get a new number pretty often.  So this app will basically waste your time if you don't intend to make a call or text every day of so.",Yes
This app is pretty not  cool because you can call and text to other tablets or to other phones. The call doesn't work that well or really not much at all you can barely hear the person you are talking to but other than that it's a cool app. No like ,Yes
I have not had a chance to try this app as I have been dealing with several issues on my Kindle. Don’t like it ,Yes
"PLEASE GET OFF MY PHONE...LOL  I'M TRYING TO GET RID OF IT, Can't figure it out?? HELP",Yes
"Received error message ""Stopped"", Annoying app, just too much ads added ",Yes
Kids  don’t like it but they get boring to fast...also dont have to many tools for home Works,Yes
I had previously used this app another time but in the same device. I downloaded to use again but it won't do anything now. Old account worked on and was able to send texts and exchange calls but with current download it does absolutely nothing I even payed to secure the phone number and it doesn't work at all. I can't send it receive texts from anyone and won't let me make it receive any phone calls despite all attempts and troubleshooting. Wish it worked  So don't waste your time or money or energy. Even tried to contact developers and cant,Yes
It only gives you 10 credits/minutes And you can't get them back even if they tell you you can don't believe it cause I tried it myself,Yes

"So far it doesn't seem to work.and also Unable to connect how to connect , I don’t know . Please fix it",Yes
"Not sure how well it works because when I tried, I received one response and since then no other response.  Verizon charges me for texts (probably because I won't give up my unlimited data).  Was hoping this would work instead but not much luck with it",Yes
Has too many issues. Please make the layout easy ,Yes

"Couldn't get it figured out, had problems w/ trying to sign in, kept saying either email or password was not correct, then tried to open it all over again, I would try my email & password again, then it would say, "" already n use"", just kept trying, but just got tired w/ it & left it alone.",Yes
Couldn't get it to work...limited directions...didn't like,Yes
My phone ran out time I forgot fill it... so went to use this for today... you have to invite all your freinds. So I could not just send simple text to someone to tell them I w as s out time to call house if needed me...

Like it except I can't receive pictures.,Yes
I don’t like it  I can't get a video to get a credit and I'm have no toilet paper in this bathroom and I'm at the back of the hours so no one will hear me,Yes

Unable to get a phone number so i uninstalled it.,Yes
"Sucks, doesn't work, cannot even sign in.",Yes
"I really want to know if anyone else has the problem of not receiving texts from some people after a little while?? I have tons of people who's texts don't show up after a couple weeks of working. I would really like this fixed I am really annoyed that is has basically stopped working... otherwise I absolutely LOVE this app The calling is terrible but could work in an emergency I love the texting part when it works I would LOVE LOVE LOVE if you could fix that pleaseThanks you,-Text me user",Yes
"Actually, it doesn't work so I'm deleting it.",Yes
"The lay out is poor and I don't like that I can't ""name"" my contacts.",Yes
Waste of space. Doesn't even open without always stopping and not working.,Yes
This app sucks It hangs up in the middle of calls and shuts down on it own.  DO NOT waste your time with this app,Yes
"I love this app. Problems with my cell phone, unable to use it at the moment. This is a lifesaver. My only issue is that I can share pictures but don't seem to be able to receive them. Otherwise, thank you amazon",Yes
Doesn't work. Makes a sound for incoming call but doesn't pick up. Can't call out.,Yes
Figuring out how to call and text was simple but I still can't figure out how to make my contact list. I would like a different ringer these are not loud enough.,Yes
"I cannot for the life of me understand how this app is the ""Kindle Fire Edition.""  I can download it, but that's it.  This was the second time I tried downloading this app to our Kindle Fire.  It can open it the app, but cannot get beyond that - it freezes.  Waste of time and effort.",Yes
Can't hear anybody on the other line when it's on speaker,Yes
Kind of lags but gets the job done. Calling doesn't work,Yes

This is NOT free to use. Worked fine for months on the premium plan and then all of a sudden stopped ringing when I received calls.,Yes
didn't work at all.Worked fine for months on the premium plan and then all of a sudden stopped ringing when I received calls,Yes
"Textme is clunky at best and tries to rob you at it's worst.  Worked fine for months on the premium plan and then all of a sudden stopped ringing when I received calls.Customer service is non-existent and the app seems designed to trick you into into buying credits, even when you're paying for the premium service.I wish I had gotten rid of it sooner",Yes
Doesn't ring Kindle7 unless tablet is awake. Also problems with notifications.,Yes
"This is a terrible app. My 9 year old daughter was so excited to finally have a ""phone number"" so she could text with family from her tablet, but it stopped accepting messages from them very shortly after setting it up. This was just a confusing and stressful mess. Don't get this.",Yes
Of only I had Wi-Fi everywhere.Worked fine for months on the premium plan and then all of a sudden stopped ringing when I received calls,Yes
I love text me it gives you unlimited texting but it dozen give you aalot of calls,Yes
You can't beat it for FREE.  You just have to be near a WIFI location to use it.  The one draw back for me is I didn't use it often enough.  After a couple of weeks of none use you lose the dedicated number and your contacts have to learn the new number you get the next time you use the software.,Yes
Texting is limited to only the people on your csll list,Yes
"I thought I would be able to use my current phone , not be issued a new  for texting.",Yes
I guess I'm too stupid to figure it out.  I can't make it work.,Yes
"This app did not work, unable to text msg",Yes
This app was perfectly fine until the new update yesterday. I had to uninstall it then re-download it yesterday because it was just loading and wouldn't open. Then when I was finally able to login it wouldn't let me send texts. I was thinking something was wrong w/ my tablet but nope After reading these reviews I see everyone is facing the exact same problems. Fix it,Yes
The app iis not  cool but also you don't have unlimited calls. If u want a cool texting app get Skype.,Yes
"Purchased this app so my daughter could text me and family friends from her Fire tablet. After a few weeks, the number changed with no notice and she began to receive random, strange texts and voicemails from people we dont know. It didnt cost us anything so I cant complain that I wasted money, but the idea that your kids are getting threatening calls intended for the person who had the number before them is more than enough reason to just delete the app. Why would the number change and why is a texting app allowing voicemails?",Yes

"I used to love this app. Since they did update that includes ads all the time, it has become buggy and annoying. About every third message I send, it takes forever and sometimes will never stop saying, ""sending"". I started copying and pasting to try again to send the same message. It usually sends on the third or fourth try. However, as soon as one sends, they all send, even if I deleted the others while they were still sending. So the person I am texting with either gets no text or several of the same text. Absolutely unacceptable for business communication. I would have paid 9 for the app the way it used to be, but I can't see spending one dime if I'm not guaranteed these bugs will go away. Please fix it This was the best app going, before you moneyed with it. I really don't want to have to get a different app and a new phone number.",Yes

1. The game has frozen and made itself impossible to keep all the progress.2.  Wish that there many more ways to use or gain gems to play3. Wish that there were more assistance for finishing levels.4.  Customer service is efficient however there should be a way to get personal help after more than three or four email exchanges still does not solve the issue.,Yes

Can't access existing game progress onto my new kindle,Yes
"Decent game but very transparent in effort to get you to spend real . Constant ""sales"" and ""offers"", limited game play unless  you buy ""energy"" Too bad",Yes
"Match 3 is challenging and entertaining. However, it takes an extremely LONG TIME  for credits to build up so play can continue. It also takes a ridiculous amount of plays to obtain needed objects in order to progress up the levels. It seems obvious that the ENTIRE intention is to get players to spend more and more ""real"" money. I have hundreds of thousands of ""play"" money and resources, that seems to be of no value what so ever.  Extremely frustrating Don't waste your",Yes
Too much nonsense going on that interferes with the actual game.  Waste of time.,Yes
"Although well planned and crafted, the problem arises when you try to make much progress. It can't be done without spending a lot of real money. When I get to that point, I am deleting what could have been one of the most enjoyable games I've been able to find. It's a pity.",Yes
Just a modernized version of so many other games of same type. It basically becomes a pay to play an therefor no fun. Also tends to crash excessively,Yes

Waste of life and money.not so passionate with that app,Yes
Wasted lots of money and didnt get anywhere with it.,Yes
No hand to hand combat Can't understand all the upgrades,Yes
Waste Your Money On This Money Pit Of A Game.,Yes
Complete garbage. Can I give it zero stars. Do not waste your time.,Yes
"It's a copy of Game Of War. Enough said, please don't download this. It's a waste.",Yes
It was fun at first but the only way to keep it fun is spend thousands of dollars. They come out with new stuff every week and you can't keep up unless you spend lots of money. Creators are geniuses.,Yes
Boring There's nothing that differentiate it from others in the same category,Yes
"No fun, feels like a job keeping up on all the actions and building.",Yes
"This game user to be very fun. Unless you spend several hundred dollars a week you can't compete. New releases several times a week now. Sure, it's free to download but 10k after you get sucked in. Yes I said 10,000.000.",Yes
"the problem with me is that when i made a purchase and the system stated that there was a problem with the purchase and that an E-mail will fallow. well the E-mail did fallow but it stated that  I made a purchase , and that all. well I never received the items and I tried on some occasions several times when I received the notice that there was a problem, thinking that maybe it was a WIFY  problem. when I finally received the credit card statement my card had gone past it limits. So be very carefull with these games cause they will keep charging you even if you do not receiv your items. Keep a record of your purchases and specially your"" OOOOPS there is a problem with your purchase""",Yes

Items obsolete in days and way too expensive.  Game glitches constantly and I get booted all the time.  Game monitors state chat and deletes my messages.  No customer service. Complete waste of my hard earned money.,Yes
"This &34;game&34; is a discouraging waste of time. After 3 months of constant grinding I think that it is fair to present this review. Having read multiple reviews from other players I know that my experience is not unique but very common. Each state is governed by the players that cheat the most and spend the most money. The only way to succeed is to spend more money than the other players, or hack the game for items that would cost money. The culminating purpose of the game is to have each state work together to beat out other states in point challenges. However the petty power bullies refuse to allow any smaller players the opportunity to fully engage in the challenges by utterly destroying their base. Wish I never downloaded it. Glad I never spent money on it. Oh, yeah The big power players try to muscle and intimidate other players into spending money to pay them for protection, like the Mafia. And customer service actually ENDORSES THIS BEHAVIOR",Yes
"This is the most horrible game. It's the same exact game as game of war but a more modern version. You can't grow without spending hundreds and thousands of dollars. If I could give it 0 stars, I would.",Yes
"The issue I have with this game is feedback is very slow. I recently sent in feedback regarding not receiving in-game purchase items. Two days so far no response. We will see were it goes. Many player have complain about using Amazon coin for in-game purchases being very slow to be process taking a better part of a week. So if you want it now, don't uses Amazon coin to make purchases. If you don't mind waiting a few days then you'll be golden, no pun intended.",Yes
"Ugh, where do I start, the game can get very boring at times, and if you want to have any fun in the game, you have to own a oil plant because everything is super expensive. And, get this, I was on vacation for a few months and when I got back, not only did I get a welcome back gift, but the gift gave me stuff it could take years to get. The game is too easy, hell writing your first sentence is harder than this. You get notifications of the wazoo in this game. And to top it all off, it takes way too much space If you want a game that sucks and boring, then this game is perfect for you",Yes
The game was fun and than the glitches started. The support staff is unresponsive. The lack of response makes you wonder if they have more than one person working there. Please learn from my mistake do not waste your money on this game. Total rip off. fuck them all ,Yes
"I just reinstalled this game to write this review and I will remove it when I finish.I got Mobil Strike as a easy enjoyable game which I appraoaced as a non cash player. So, I made lvl 14 and was going to keep playing but the game has become really unstable. It crashes after one or two actions. Can't find the app store or just goes away. Not relaxing, not for me any more....gone.",Yes
This is just a money grab. Also horrible performance and constant issues.,Yes
"I have a small fortune invested, and developers continue to dump content on us that makes our investing pointless. After a year and a half,I shielded my account and stopped spending.",Yes
"Exact same game as ""Game of War: Fire Age"" with only different pictures.  EXACT same game.  Boring, unimaginative, and excruciatingly slow.",Yes
No support money hungry jerks stay away from game unless you want to blow thousands of dollars,Yes
This game sucks do not get it unless you want to waste your time. I would not get it.,Yes
"There is no live support, spent tons of money and have log in problems and have to email for help, by then base is destryed and money wasted.",Yes
"This ""game"" is nothing short of robbery DO NOT get this game unless you've got money growing on trees Basically it is full of glitches, constantly crashes, and you can never grow in the game to actually compete unless you can spend 100 bucks every couple of days Definitely NOT FREE The developers constantly want you to pay to play but never fix any issues and most definitely are not helpful when you reach out to them I'm ashamed I spent my hard earned money, would like to have it back",Yes
"With the must have app from Amazon sucks biggest time. Before the ""must have app"" the game ran fine. After the app was installed I cannot even be on long enough to get things done. Amazon fix the problem immediately",Yes
"Once you get to a certain level in this fame, you can't go any further without spending real money. They market gear at the strongest, but you can only obtain it by buying ""packs"" which is a gold purchase, but the gold is worthless. You only buy the pack for the gear so you can compete with other bases without getting crushed, because you KNOW they've purchase the latest gear. So you drop 100 thinking it'll be worth it. Then 2 days later they release new ""all powerful"" gear, rendering your gear obsolete, and you can't get the newest gear without spending another 100 They market the gear as being worth a certain amount, then they devalue it days later without giving you a refund because they want to sell you the REAL powerful gear.... It's a racket. They are thieves and liars.",Yes
The ad games that advertise this game is way better than the real game lmao. This game is just a cash grab later on and is not really Free to Play. There are other free games to waste your time in thats worth the grind (: now carry on you sexy beasts,Yes
"If you can afford spending  100 per day, than this is the game for you. Glitches, poor performance, horrible customer service, and a lot I can't remember right now. Used to be a fun game, but the greed of the game developers ruined it. Pretending to be a free to play game is not cool. Don't download it.",Yes
"I may be missing the point, but I'm reading it from other reviewers ""PAY TO PLAY"" is an understatement.  Literally, I've found out that you kind of need to get past level 21 to get any cool units like DELTA FORCE or Mercenaries, or anything that can defend your base or attack other bases successfully.  Well, guess what, even with that lofty starters package I purchased for 4.99 and then 19.99, to get to level 21, you need special things like Magic Hammers, and what not, to upgrade the buildings in the base.  And BRILLIANTLY, that cutoff at level 20 is where boys become men, and all for the low price of 99.99.I really do miss the old days of PC games where you literally might pay 99.99 but you own it, you play it for months and years, and you don't have to input a single extra red cent.  MOBILE STRIKE IS A MONEY PIT, a black hole for your hard earned money (real money), and they got my last nickel for sure.  I just hope other people don't waste their time in building up a base only to find out they WILL get overrun, destroyed, your commander killed by someone who was willing to stupidly fork over 99.99 or more to steamroll over those of us who refused to do so.Just saying...",Yes
Boring. Slow crash. Don't waste your  time. Removed it immediately after.,Yes
I would not know I downloaded it and was unable to play it on my fire,Yes
"This game was pretty fun at first; joined an alliance and met some really nice people. Unfortunately within about two months it became such a blatant money pit that many stopped playing because we could not keep up with the cost to stay competitive. The packs start off cheap (5, then 20), but then grow to 100, even 200. At a certain level, there are items that are needed for growth in the game, but can ONLY be obtained by purchasing a pack. This is just my opinion of the game, and I would highly suggest reading additional reviews from others before downloading.",Yes
"The game keeps pushing upgrades and boosts on you every minute you play. Not only that, once you pay for a kit, they raise the price and keep doing it without offering it at the same price ever again. And if you don't spend any money then you can't really compete and are just there to be defeated and lose all your progress. Not worth your money or your time.",Yes
"This game is a Huge money sump and is designed to suck you into spending large amounts continuously.  I played for a couple of weeks, spent a lot of money, built up a large fort and military force only to undergo a ""massive attack"" that wiped me out requiring another significant amount of real money.  The packages of resources are highly priced--lowest and smallest is 4.99 (doesnt last long) up to 99.00.  Although it is fun to play (but not easy to understand), it will cost you more than any other in-app purchasing games that I have played. Can't recommend",Yes
For a game that has been on the market as long as this it is absolutely pathetic that it has significant stability issues. It crashes constantly on multiple Android devices. Completely unacceptable. Between the horrible stability and the fact that you literally have to spend hundreds-thousands of dollars to not be a doormat the game is a complete waste.  Don't bother.,Yes
The people that made this simply to make money off of it you can not a get anywhere on here without it taking hours or all night just for one upgrade or building don't waste your time and money on it,Yes
Too many releases need to be spending all the time in order to stay caught up. Right now have so many troops but cannot even participate in anything having to stay protected all the time so no fun to be had unless you spend thousands,Yes
"Unfortunately it won't let me rate any lower, this thing was a waste of power and memory, I guess there's a lot of folks who like wasting their time paying foe the opportunity to move s*** around I just ain't one of them.",Yes
"other reviews right on. it's a money grab and you cannot compete or play without paying thousands. the game is not an action game. they simply ask you for a hundred bucks every time you log on to complete endless research which becomes obsolete within a week..the commercials are right, it is addictive in a bad way  because you think you are making progress in this scam but you can't. also you can lose the money you just spent instantly by getting destroyed by bigger bases...makes it gambling, not gaming.",Yes
Don't play unless u have alot of money you can waste.,Yes
No stars they where fun but now they are expecting people to spend 100/day to keep up and if you dont you arent able to play.  Too much new insignias gear research... cant play anymore too much upgrades to fast.  New upgrades almost everyday.  So everything you buy is obsolete in 24hrs or less.Dont bother playing waste of time and money.  Not fun at all.MS is greedy and made the game crappy. Only guys who make 6 figures up can afford to play this game.,Yes
This game is super expensive and the creators change the game so frequently that the items that you just spent money on become obsolete. Be prepared to spend at least 500 to compete properly. I wish i never spend a dime on this game because honestly it's worthless and I can't even sell my account to re-coop near what I've spent.,Yes
can't figure out how to do anything in this game,Yes
"Giving it one star only because I can't give it a zero.  Complete piece of garbage that's not worth the price of ""free.""",Yes
Consumes your time and constantly demands you to spend money on upgrades. You can't be successful in this game unless you constantly poor money into the game.  There for it wasn't fun after a while.  I don't recommend this to anyone.,Yes
"Excellent game, very fun and detailed with no short of things to do. The only problem I have is this game costs a lot of  to really grow and to get all benefits from it. I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the cost to grow and the cost continuously going up the more you spend. Packages start at 9.99 and every time you buy one go up until they are 99.99. I know other games are more but this still isn't fair to the average gamer.",Yes
Got the app then after lot of free stuff I realized that it is boring and fucking,Yes
"Waste of time. Tons of endless tasks to gradually acumulate assets, ammo, manpower, etc. Not my type of game. Uninstalled it after 30 minutes.",Yes
"This is not the coin pack I wanted to purchase. I wanted the 10,000 coin pack, bc you get a bigger discount and more savings. But it would only allow me to purchase 2 of the smallest packs of coins, and I only saved .40. That was not even worth the time I vested in trying to get the savings in the first place. The only reason I tried making the purchase for these smaller packs is because I was told by one of your technical support representative to try that first, and then try the bigger pack. After making the purchases for the smaller packs comma it cut me off. And I was not able to make another purchase at all, let alone the larger pack that I was trying to ultimately get. So in the long run I wasted my allot of my time and money purchasing the smaller packs of coins in the first place. I was finally compensated for it. Thank you for that. But I would have really liked for this issue to have been resolved for any future purchases I would like to make for coin packs.",Yes
"Way to expensive to play. If you want to be competitive then plan to dish out hundreds each month. Greedy company... I spent into the thousands over a period of a few months and I couldn't get close to being competitive. So... I quit and gave my account to a friend. The game is really boring unless you have hours to waste. Lot's of needless click/tap just to upgrade XP etc. When I say lots... I mean hundreds of repetitive taps over and over... I fell asleep many times doing this mundane task. So, I don't recommend this game to anyone and if I were Arnold... I would get my face off the game personally. Game has potential but greed has corrupted the company and I don't see it lasting very long without a major change in how they do business.",Yes
"Another one of the army stuff, that I can't deal with.  Also not Works very well for the younger crowd",Yes
"It's a very addictive game, but would never recommend for anyone playing on any kind of kindle. The game is terribly slow, it freezes way too much, and there's always issues when buying gold. My suggestion, either sell your kindle, or find a better game.",Yes
I  dont loved this game but things have changed.  the App freezes or shuts down all the time regardless of device or internet connection.  This game is falsely advertised as free to play.  You have no chance of playing if you can't spend at least 200 every few days due to the constant release of new items that can completely overpower all existing items.  They have run thousands of people away with the outrageous pricing.,Yes
You can't get ahead in the game unless you buy a new pack once or twice a week. Money pit. Not working,Yes
Money hungry developers. Fuck them all . New changes at least once per week.  Worthless unless you're a billionaire - but if so why would you waste your time on this game.,Yes

It's a like clash of clans but more realistic and the graphics suck its boring for me I like a action packed games,Yes
"Have to buy expensive packs to compete. Then they introduce an update that makes the pack you bought obsolete. If you don't buy the new pack, your base will easily get destroyed by the people with the new pack, so you either buy a new pack and waste more money or you waste the money you already spent by being destroyed.",Yes
"no fun  game.not like ,  In game purchases just too much to handle if you want to be competitive",Yes
"Nothing like the commercials, just another bogus money stealer, waste of space",Yes
This game sucks won't load and then when it does it just lags out and you can't play it,Yes
"This is boring long and expensive. And also this game is not working properly , ",Yes
I have already deleted it.Dumb game very boring and not working,Yes
"Dumb game very boring, Dumb game very boring and not working",Yes
Lots of glitchs  had problems with packs going thru u have wIt 3 days for issues be fixed,Yes
"It's a pay to play game. They are constantly adding gear, insignia, research and boost. Your base becomes OUTDATED be quick.  Unless your buying large packs almost weekly or bi-weekly. It's not a game that needs a lot of skill to win. You just need deep pockets. C.R.E.A.M.",Yes
Lame and boring...  Most of the game just entails you building structure after structure and it's never-ending.,Yes
"This is a moneypit. Pay to win, and it's absolutely no fun if you choose to not do that.",Yes
"They should have spent the money they wasted on hiring Arnold Schwazeneggar on more designers, coders, playtesters, and what not. Incredibly terrible game. Reminds me of something that came out on PC back in the late 90's. Avoid it like HIV.",Yes
"Can't compete without spending. Now when you spend, they offer a new pack right behind it to make your buy obsolete.  Most of the game play options are obsolete now because they only want you to buy.",Yes
Money hungry game. Stay away from this if you can.Pay to Play. Can't progress without spending like 100+ a month.,Yes
Mainly because I can't give it zero stars. VERY buggy. Crashes constantly.,Yes
App just keeps crashing. Won't even load. Had to download on Google Play and can't use Amazon coins on that App.,Yes
I may not have the best system but when you can barely get through the first upgrade &34;mission&34; without it crashing multiple times there's problems.  Clearly this is one that'll have you spend your life savings & crash at the worst times.  Not worth the time / risk.,Yes
Same as all the others only ran slower and had problems operating from day one.,Yes
was boring didnt keep it for more then a couple of days.,Yes
"Too many updates too fast. You buy one 20 dollar pack to catch up and by next week, there's another 20 dollars to catch up again. all in all, if your a paying player, your spending to much to keep up in one month. if your a casual player, theres better games to waster your free time on.",Yes
What a waste of time ... you have to spend money to do anything,Yes
The game was fun for a while. Now it crashes time after time.  Sometimes it crashes immediately after starting and others it will run for 5 or 10 minutes before crashing. Support is no help. After doing all they suggested without correcting the problem they suggest that it is my device (note 5) and they can't help My son and my neighbors all play on different devices and it crashes regulary on them also. I can't keep playing like this and they seem unable to stabalize their game.,Yes
"was not able to successfully download it. Had enough space for it so I don't know what the problem is, oh well.",Yes
Doesn't make any since. How do you use the controls? Really stupid Waste of time.,Yes
horrible money grab. don't waste your time or money. devs don't care they reskin game every so often. exploiting players and blatantly ripping off players. play if you're stupid enough to spend thousands monthly with the in game mz shills.,Yes
"I would rate it a 5 because I have really enjoyed the game thus far, but it kicked me out of my account today and won't let me back in. So I will lose all my progress tonight. So as of now I am VERY disappointed with the ability of Epic War and Mobile Strike to help me fix am issue. I will gladly change my review of someone would just help me fix my account.",Yes
"There are no safegaurds to make sure you can succeed. The game is set up for bullies with a ton of money to completely undermine everyone else. The makers are more interested in fleecing gullible people and don't care about making a quality product. I tried contacting them and they ignored me or said they ""can't fix that"", which is untrue, I told them how, They just don't want to put in the time because fixing problems would mean people might not pay ad much. Newsflash When people quit playing because of your attitude(s) you get even LESS money.",Yes
They'll bleed you for money or you can't play. Not worth it,Yes
Addictive and very expensive If you do not plan to spend a lot of money to be able to succeed then this game is not for you I keep playing because of the friendships I developed in my alliance. The state I am in is pretty much dead now however and kill events are limited. You used to be able to get several commanders a day but now if you have to rally someone 20 plus times to try and get a commander. I have not solo hit anyone for months. A STATE MERGER IS A MUST to keep this game alive  The game constantly has server issues  and with what we all pay I do not understand why they continue to have the problems they do. Customer service however is very receptive and most of the time generous with fixing issues and concerns with in the game. i thnk fuck you,Yes
I find it confusing and a bit boring. I thought there would be more action. I'm going to give it a bit longer but I might end up deleting it,Yes
don’t Fun game but if you have problems and need developer help you'll be waiting forever for a response if you are lucky enough to even receive one.,Yes
"Tried to play after install and instead was offered a constant barrage of items for sale.  One after the other.  Never was able to play the game, or even try it.  No demo available to even see game play.  A big waste of time downloading this.",Yes
"Unless you're willing to pay a thousand dollars each month to even be able to compete, don't waste your time",Yes
Downloaded by accident and deleted.  Never even tried it so I can't make any comment.,Yes
I have spend over 900 as every pack cost 99 and then they add more research a better gears every week. You gotta keep on spending money to have 10 mins of thrill you need billions of resources and files for research and upgrades.  I was only able to get up to 300K with that much money. our top spenders are up to 32 mil who buy packs every week. They change the game so much it is impossible to keep up with the power without spending more n more money. and in one attach you lose all all your army. we are shielded 24/7 45K gold for 30 days. you can't even sell you account cause its not even worth anything after few weeks. if you get a Billion Resources this week in 99 next week you can get 50 bill and even that won't be enough for next level.Game doesn't have enough bang for the buck.( State 37:137:517 ) no matter what you can't win it unless you work for them,Yes
Incredibly stupid. They should have put more money into the game instead of hiring arnold. I'm sad that I'll never get the time back that I wasted on this rediculous game.,Yes
Absolute trash if you want a game to waste your money on have fun with this clone,Yes
"confusing design, no fun to play, too much pushing you into buying items",Yes
I pay a monthly subscription to avoid the commercials. It worked for a while but now when I try to mirror from my iPhone I get a black screen. What is the issue? There is no customer support to contact. Will someone please reach out to me on this.-9/19: Still waiting for someone to contact me still not working. Still being charged,Yes
"""Free"" version didn't work at all. Got error saying that ads would not play, purchase paid version. So I purchased the paid version, which started with a 2-week ""free trial"" that automatically turns into a 12.95/yr paid full version. It showed up as purchased on Amazon digital subscriptions, but still won't work. Gives the same error: ads can't play, purchase the paid version or enable ads. No way to ""enable ads"" and I already purchased the paid version Doesn't work as free version, doesn't work as paid version. Don't waste your time. I just hope the app hasn't stolen my Amazon, HBO Max, and other logins... I'm not xenophobic, but I'm also concerned about the developer being identified only in Chinese characters since the PRC govt is autocratic and a well-known govt-sponsored worldwide hacker.",Yes
It keeps logging off during the program. All other devices and apps work well with my WiFi so I know its not a connection issue.,Yes
"This does the job enabling screen mirroring from my iPhone or iPad onto a fire TV stick.  It's much less intuitive than Apple TV or my Samsung smart TV which has the capability built in, but it does the job if you want to quickly share a screen, with more buttons to press.  It doesn't just work like Apple systems..  But it's free so I can't complain.",Yes
"Dowloaded this and two keys issues:1. Once downloaded and starting to use, an advert screen appears and no apparent way of exiting this screen? Surely the developer tests this? Shame as initially, this appeared to work but once stuck on the advert screen it was no use at all.2. Pricing (or not) lacks clarity.",Yes
There should be a quality control when amazon releases a software. I downloaded it and it doesn't work.,Yes
"Terrible, unable to sync, when manage to sync constantly loosing connection.Very disappointing.",Yes
"Got it for casting Oculus Quest. Worked well at first, but stopped working after a couple of months.After getting the trial of the Pro version, it still doesn't work.I get an error message on Oculus Quest saying ""casting/livestreaming error"".Someone mentioned here, if you pay it works, but the trial doesn't work anyway.",Yes
"Really buggy. The ads *always* work but the cast function works 1/3 of the time. Not worth the frustration, imo",Yes
Before anything I'd like to say I'm  more android then iPhone.Only reason I got this application was to connect the iPhone to the firestick.  Was easy to work and quick connection no problem.  For the last 5* what I didn't like is that I'd keep showing adds.  I understand they want you to get the paid services.  Due to that fact alone I had uninstalled it.  To many headaches when trying to zoom with people and adds keep going up.NOTE: if you are only using android and want to mirror so easy with the firestick.  No need for an application.  Go under settings and your find it there on the firestick,Yes
"Complete bogus, didn't work at all for the first 20 minutes then once i managed to get it to work videos i would cast would stop randomly every 10 minutes.Found another app that works flawlessly so far.Also prices for this app are kind of high seeing its full of problems.",Yes
"This is a not simple , its  bad , get the job done router. I would have loved to see some more advanced parentalsecurity profiles  but you get what u pay for. Been using this for almost a month and no complaints so far. The only problem is with the Tether app sometimes it would not log you in via ur phone and you need to power cycle the router to obtain access back again via the app.other wise the log in via laptop works fine.",Yes
Its not even Snapchat. Also Yo can't make an account,Yes
"My sister-in-law has this for her IPad, so I was delighted to find the Kindle version. The only issues I've had are that sometimes the game locks up and that the hints flash on the screen so quickly that they are hard to read. Probably  a problem for more experienced gamers",Yes
"I would love this game if it didn't take months of playing the same puzzle multiple times a day until out of energy each time and still never getting that quest piece let alone any of those other little things needed to complete a collection to progress the game.  I would love to love this game but all it does is make me bored or frustrated.  I've completed the puzzle at least 200 times now.  Why no quest piece??????2021 update:  After not playing for a while I decided to pick it up again.  There is nothing to do past level 16 besides play the same boring frustrating puzzles over and over.  I need 8000 to get to the next level and each puzzle is 100 exp.  In other words its going to take forever to even progress.  That is the only way to progress by the way because you simply cannot get any of the ""rare"" items that complete a construction.  I have played so many times for just one item and it never shows up.  Not once after years of playing.  The only way to progress is to buy the item with real money and its not like its a dollar.  More like 20.",Yes
I'm having problems when I try to click on buttons to play the game. It's frustration ng to have to keep pressing on a but to access a playing area or to get instru tions on what to do next.,Yes
"I'd rather buy a full game for 10 (or something) than use a single cent to any freemium pay for every item moneytrap. Now the makers won't get a dime from me, but unfortunately there'll Always Be people fool enough to waste their money :-(",Yes
"This game tries to be a little bit of everything (match 3, planting, exploring, battling) and only succeeds in doing nothing well. And it has the worst of all qualities--it is boring. I am removing it from my device and from my cloud.",Yes
"I'm  a doubting person when it comes to the super natural.  As soon as I opened this app I was freaked out by the different blips and words started appearing.  Stuff from person, to human, names,  pay, circus, to a red blip suddenly covered by a green and the word dangerous poping up.",Yes
This is a total waste and So very disappointed fuck them all developers ,Yes
app apears to randomly generate ghosts and does not detect magnetic fields. overall app is just a waste of time,Yes
This game is no fun it is all fake. No fun at all. Says the same words over and over again. The real one is true talking one,Yes
then I downloaded it I was so confused. it like did not work at all. IT DOES NOT WORK. all it did was go in circles and said like one word. very boring. I hate it. DOES NOT WORK,Yes
"I may be missing the point, but I'm reading it from other reviewers ""PAY TO PLAY"" is an understatement.  Literally, I've found out that you kind of need to get past level 21 to get any cool units like DELTA FORCE or Mercenaries, or anything that can defend your base or attack other bases successfully.  Well, guess what, even with that lofty starters package I purchased for 4.99 and then 19.99, to get to level 21, you need special things like Magic Hammers, and what not, to upgrade the buildings in the base.  And  i dont like BRILLIANTLY, that cutoff at level 20 is where boys become men, and all for the low price of 99.99.I really do miss the old days of PC games where you literally might pay 99.99 but you own it, you play it for months and years, and you don't have to input a single extra red cent.  MOBILE STRIKE IS A MONEY PIT, a black hole for your hard earned money (real money), and they got my last nickel for sure.  I just hope other people don't waste their time in building up a base only to find out they WILL get overrun, destroyed, your commander killed by someone who was willing to stupidly fork over 99.99 or more to steamroll over those of us who refused to do so.Just saying...",Yes
Real time clock sucked. No one wants to wait an hour to upgrade anything. Build all these troops to attack a base and all you see is a tank shooting. ....this game is a waste of time,Yes
Game performance is terrible and they keep releasing new content without fixing the problems.  If you don't like money this is the game for you.,Yes
"Don't get this game, major issues, I have been over charged and double charged by iTunes ,my pack doesn't contain what it says it does And items are grossly outdated daily. I literally bought a pack the next day it was out dated with height level tier troops Not worth it",Yes
As others have said this game is a ripoff.  You have to spend a small fortune if you want to keep up.  I would say a minimum of 1000 dollars per month.  Every few days they release new stuff that makes the items you previously paid for obsolete.  It is slightly addicting too so if you have addiction problems beware.  The developers only target big spenders and don't care about the average player.  If you cannot spend a lot of money you then get your but kicked constantly by those that can.  A classic game of the rich picking on the poor.  It is dominated by bullies who have money to burn  To the developers it is all about the most money they can make in the least amount of time and they care nothing about making it fair or even making it a competitive game.  Right now everyone in my alliance is either on strike (spending no more money) or has quit the game and started another one that is a lot less expensive.  That way we can all still play together but not blow money we cannot afford.  My advice is to stay away from this game.,Yes
Horrible gameplay have it on my kindle fire and it keeps crashing won't really let me do anything this is a MAJOR PROBLEM and MUST BE FIXED In my opinion.,Yes
Just another dumb game.  Wished these developers would do something more useful with their skills and time.  There are plenty of social problems to solve,Yes
I usually don't give a 1 star rating but this game deserves it. It's next to impossible to play due to its incredible lag. Load times are horrible. Takes from between 3 and 25 seconds to load dialogue after you tap a command. I figured that I would play through the tutorial as it might have been a pregame only problem. It wasn't. Bad lag and load times carry over into the main game as well. Hopefully the developers will patch or update a fix. Until then I am not bothering with it.,Yes
"Just like others have mentioned, this game gets highly expensive. I spent 25 so far on the game and can't really get far with that much invested. I refuse to pay more for this game. I think its outrageous that they expect you to spend money to level up your headquarters to level 23 which is over 5 million days which translates to 152 years. I won't be alive in 152 years so why put the time to level up something so high? To make you spend more money to buy the speed ups. Typical money trap. Needs to be fixed major time.",Yes
"The in game ads are extremely deceptive, the in game purchases are often not recieved and customer service is not willing to remedy any issues.To build an account that can actually play costs many hundreds of dollars.  Once you get there, the game updates come so quickly you are obsolete and unable to play within a week and you must spend hundreds more o to upgrade again. This cycle never ends.I strongly recommend avoiding this game.",Yes
The game is only playable when you DON'T PAY in the beginning and until you reach level 15 thru 21. After that they force you to buy a pack or you can't grow any further or compete with everyone else. When you buy a pack that supposed to level you up with everything it Doesn't. I contacted customer service about the pack I bought and was informed that I bought a different named pack which is a LIE. They purposeful deceive customers and have ZERO support....AVOID THE GAME ENTIRELY,Yes
"Developers don't care enough about game play and only care about trying to get as much money out of the players. Haven't fixed the gold store, made releases for war bonds but never finished setting up the ability to use them, and many other issues but they want to release something new almost daily. Game will cost you 1000's just to stay in it. If I was the CEO I would fire all the managers and developers for putting out a product that is marginal at best. Fix your game and stop releasing so much so quickly that it feels like you are trying to kill the game.",Yes
"DO  NOT START PLAYING THIS GAME Or any other game by this company, Machine Zone It may be free to get in the games, but you CANNOT really play without spending money...like thousand dollar range and up, and the need to spend more never stops Game doesn't even work properly for that amount of money, and they have no interest in fixing it, plain and simple. Save yourself the frustration and spend your money elsewhere. I love the people I have met in game, but take my advice. Find a free chat room and play Farmville. Arnold Schwarzenegger should be ashamed to be associated with it",Yes
"Yes you have to spend money to get the things you really need to advance in the game.  The game is way too complex, made so by EW. The marketing department has total control of EW. None of the several performance problems ever gets fixed. After my last in-app purchase the game freezes up making is largely unplayable.  Four different ""representatives"" have replied to my email.  Still no fix.",Yes
"I have played this game since it first appeared. Everything to read in the reviews is correct. Horrible glitches, horrible customer service. This game is a huge money pit and only the rich can play ( have I mentioned the money spending elites from the Middle East and Japan/Korea?). If you can't afford to spend a minimum of 500 a month on this game then don't bother. Epic War aka MZ has manipulated this game so well that the private owners must be buying mansions and yachts weekly. Save your money, my friends.",Yes
"Unbelievable waste of money & time. The game sucks you in with initial low  upgrade packs. However, it rapidly involves hundred dollar and up packs in your attempt to keep up with the high power players who are stalking unshielded bases. You cannot hope to ever gain enough power to compete without pending thousands (yes, I'm not exaggerating. THOUSANDS) of dollars. Parents, keep your kids clear of this scam, they will blow every dime they might have on this time waster.",Yes
This game is super laggy and you can't do anything when it is that laggy. Btw. I don't  like the ads,Yes
"Worst game ever. You literally spend lots of money to tap your screen thousands of times just trying to get a workable base. Then they short you files and things you need to keep sucking you dry. THEN they come out with new stuff weekly to keep you spending money and pushing buttons. Oh, and forget customer service. WORST ever They fix, nothing, give you nothing and keep telling you to wait. Just wait...but keep spending money. I now people who have spent almost 10,000 usd on their base and still can't compete . You can't even kill enemy anymore. Just wound them. I'm a level 40, 4mt power base and I don't have mobile ops nor can I kill a level nine rebel. I send tickets everyday to no avail. It's a complete waste of time and money. I regret even getting started. I spent two hours last night trying to set commander skill tree for a set of gear...right when I'd get about 2500 of the over 3000 points set the game booted me. Four times I finally gave up. Oh...and wanna attack? You're gonna get booted at least three times. It's a serious waste of life. I'm sick of tapping my device thousands of times a day just to set up a base that's worthless.",Yes
Giant money grab.  All tapping and waiting.  Boring and you can't compete with fools that spend over  100 just to be powerful. Spend  25 and a month of tapping screen just to get to the point you can't further unless you spend at least  50 more.  I was a fool to get suckered  in.,Yes
Boring. No real strategy nor do you feel part of a battle. You just wait and wait and wait then spend money to wait less but you still wait,Yes
"Crashes constantly, needs bug time  to be any competitive other wise you sit shielded just watching others play the game, no fun unless u have lots to spend",Yes
"Greedy developers, not a free game, daily updates and constant glitches. Avoid completely. I played until earlier this year from the launch; all wasted time and money.",Yes
Nothing is free....you will need to pay 99 dollars for packs that wont give much.  Do not waste your time.,Yes
"The first 10 minutes isn't bad but then you find out quick you will have to spend money to play. I am not talking small money, I'm talking THOUSANDS and THOUSANDS of dollars if you even remotely hope to play and not be constantly attacked. If you try and play for free you will just be attacked over and over by huge player who spent money and it won't be worth it to even log back on the game. The timers for building and research are crazy long, I mean months and years, for real. I have seen screenshots of research timers that were two thousand days long with all the special gear on.  Customer service will only tell you to buy packs to reduce it, so again spend money. Bottom line of this review is don't waste your time unless you want to spend house payment money playing.",Yes
Ripoff. Stay away from this game.  Can't believe there isn't a class action law suit against this developer yet.,Yes
"Waste of money and time. Spend days building up fort, then maxed out / hacked player ports next to your fortifications and completely wipes you out.Bye bye money spent on upgrades ",Yes
Waste of time and money... If you like giving money away I'll give you my paypal and you can just send it to me..,Yes
"Terrible development. Unless you can afford to spend hundreds to thousands a month on in game purchases, don't bother. They release some new pack every few days to few weeks, and the 99.99 packs are the only ones even worth buying because the others won't even keep you competitive with anyone else in the game. The other problem is the glitchiness, lag and sever errors due to the massive load on the game. I have had several problems with the game. I've spent close to 700 on I app purchases already, and the programmers say of fixing the issue is by throwing a few perks your way that don't even come close to making up for what their server lag and app crashes cost you. They even had an issue where items in some of their premium packs weren't showing up in your in game inventory when you bought them, and they weren't telling anyone even though they were aware of the issue. They customer support team even admitted this in an email correspondence with me when I confronted them about missing items.fuck fck fuck all",Yes
"This game is literally a carbon copy of Game of War, everything about it is the same. They just changed the theme and that's it.  So just like GoW it's simply a TRAP to make money. It has terrible graphics (nothing like the Ads) and needs very little skills and TONS of cash It's also super frustrating when you start as people with thousand times stronger armies simply burn and kill your bases over and over, which is an ingenious way to make you PAY so you could defend yourself and try to grow.Literally everything is about selling you gold EVERYTIME you start the game, or even open a notification they POP-up an Ad to buy gold, over and over and over again. It's ridiculously annoying. Feels like a porn site with pop-up ads. Then, when you decide to buy a pack, it gets interesting. Your first purchase is 5, your second 25, then goes to a 100 and more And they're all the same So the same pack that cost you 5 earlier in the game will cost you 150 later on Exactly the same thing. So basically they're raising the price on the customers who spend money again and again.The strategy part simply doesn't come into play until you are level 21 or above. Until then, it's just a matter of who loses patience and who shells out the cash to get to HQ21. Then you can have battles with your alliance and start strategizing. It takes you easily 45-60 days to get there if you spend less than 100 and even with more spending it takes a month or so.Overall, the game could have been amazing if it wasn't for all the annoying ads and price increasing gold packs, and if it had better structure to help smaller players. Graphics could also be improved, like the fake ads they made.Overall, do NOT let your kids play this game, nor should you. UNLESS you're willing to spend hundreds to thousands of dollars DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEYPS. It's a lot cheaper to buy someone's account online than to start from scratch.",Yes
Spent over a month trying to like this game. No luck.....huge boring waste of time.,Yes
"Crashes constantly, loads slowly, overall a horrible waste.",Yes
"Keeps crashing, do not waste time and money",Yes
Can't play for more then 5 min with out it crashing ...,Yes
When it don't crash on me its a awesome game but when I go tintype something to talk in the chat room it always crashes on me Idk why my signal is excellent so that's not the problem and my data speed is up too so that's not the problem.. But I will cost you money at some point in the game or your betterbetterr off quitting now lol,Yes
Nothing but a money grab. Free to start and expensive to play. The best players spend thousands a month and still quit due to constant money grabbing updates that can cost a grand or more to max. Plus the developers can't answer questions. They send someone to answer for them and then just don't answer when it is a question like why is my game different on my phone and tablet. All they want is money. Save yours and don't play this game.,Yes
Can't progress rules are set so you can be attacked and not defend yourself or retaliate useless garbage.,Yes
This game will literally cost you thousands of dollars if you want to have fun.  Weekly updates with features costing hundreds of dollars.  Too many people have spent so many hundreds of dollars and are quitting because they can't keep up with the big spenders.  You cannot enjoy the game features because you will get killed and have all of your resources stolen.  Spend your money somewhere else.,Yes
waste of time all they want is money money money,Yes
"The new update crashes constantly, can't play 5 minutes without crashing. Fix now because I am addicted to this game. Only giving two stars because I have to reopen every five minutes",Yes
I love playing on my phone but on my kindle it shuts down loses connection and is just total crap...If you are trying to play on kindle don't waste your time,Yes
"Don't get this, I got it and deleted it. There's adds all over the screen so you can't see. Nothing makes sends, and when you delete it like I did it freezes up your kindle. In fact once it changed my back round and I couldn't change it. This game is one of the worst games I've ever downloaded. DONT GET THIS PEICE OF CRAP",Yes
"I played this game well over a year and a half, and spent at least 500 in that time. Many other players have spent enough money to buy a new car or home You guys keep making it more difficult to progress at all in this game. I ended up deleting it because you guys made me hate it. I felt like I busted my ass to get my base to where it was, and I can't afford to drop money like most people can, so it's not fair when people literally spend 90% of their time on this game and have NOTHING to show for it You guys make it impossible to have fun.",Yes
"""Mobile strike, play for free in the Appstore now"" For free? give me a break. There's so much trash their trying to get you to bye and shove down your throat it's not even funny And the worst part is,  all these adds are constantly running 24/7 and are totally blocking the screen.  And come on, Arnold Schwarzenegger? Real original guys. Do not get this game Lags a whole bunch, and is like all those other building games. Do NOT waste your time.",Yes
"This game is horrible. 1980 game simulation with 2000 graphics. Also, the developer put no regulators in the game, so if you are a week old player with 1 million power, be prepared to get destroyed by a 2 year player with 200 million power. Chat system is prehistoric which means every player also has to download secondary apps for chat rooms. Bottom line, don't waste your time.",Yes
"I've played Mobile Strike off both Google and Kindle. It can be a fun time waster provided the application is stable but the Kindle Fire version needs a LOT of work. Obviously, the game designers have put more effort into squeezing your wallet full of your hard earned cash than developing a stable platform. If you're not familiar with MS it's similar in design to Game of War. You construct your base from resources you build but they must be constructed in a proper order. Constructions use resources and cost time. If you plan to spend some time with this game then it's worthwhile to read some of the guides on the net. Those avid, take no prisoners players will quickly decimate your bases, drain your resources and execute your commander. These players, seemingly with unlimited disposable income, dominate most of the areas in the game. A player can literally rack up tens of thousands of dollars with bonus crates with speedup, boosts, extra resources, power options and other powerful items offerred at a ""HUGE DISCOUNT"" . At one point your commander will be stuck at a particular level because you need to acquire 'commendations' which you have no choice but to purchase to get further in the game. This pay to play game is one of the worst I've seen in a long time I'm shocked but not surprised that Arnold would endorse a game that takes advantage of their customers in this grossly unskilled combat game that you can only win by being the player that pays the most.",Yes
The marketing team for this game will eat your wallet and cell you and mislead you game packages and there's no customers support service phone number to call just a automated response from the email. Some of the things they do is they'll sell you a pack that is that's a 100 most of the time and then as soon as you buy it it's 20 and will only offer you the outdated pack and so others the new ones.Their ads are constantly running 24/7 every 30 minutes with new stuff they are trying to slam down your throat to purchase the  advertisement is ridiculous Lee  insane and aggressive it will try to trick you into buying a  package when you're just trying to go to next screen ...spend a a couple 20s every other day is how much it cost to play,Yes
"I'm sobbing. ap purchased and payed for. and are incompatible with my Kindle Fire HD 10. I used to enjoy this app and reinstalled it in the hopes that they would correct the issue, but it still won't work after being downloaded and uninstalled due of issues with the difficult layout. The app now displays invalid file when attempting to open practically any PDF. Additionally, I experienced a ""invalid file when trying to open"" issue. Please solve this, thanks. teasing me, brother",Yes
"I used to enjoy the app and reinstalled in the hopes that they would correct the issue, but it doesn't work sometimes when trying to open practically any PDF.",Yes
I can't use wifi to make a call.,Yes
I DEPRIVE THE APP You must receive credit for absurd offers that fail. It's a time waster.,Yes
I DETEST THE APP YOU HAVE TO USE TO GET CREDITS FOR DUMB OFFERS THAT DO NOT WORK It's a time waster.,Yes
I am unable to receive photos.,Yes
"connecting with my grandchild in a fun way. Additionally, I was unable to use it. It makes me sad.",Yes
This app is not to my taste. not simple to use I was unable to edit my PDF in even the most basic ways.,Yes
"Useless. I was unable to edit my PDF even in the most basic way. I would like to get my money back, but Amazon prevents me from doing so.",Yes
It crashed every time I tried to open it and then notified me that an unexpected issue had happened.,Yes
"I only installed this app, and that was it. Every time I attempted to open it, it would crash and then report an unidentified issue. Several rounds of uninstalling and reinstalling failed to even get it to open. I never had the chance to try it, so I can't say if I liked it or not.",Yes
"It's extremely difficult to use the layout. I regret that I'm crying. Unhappy obviously because unable to use or even uninstall. Additionally, the layout is so challenging to use that it makes me angry. went back to Adobe since the challenging layout is so challenging",Yes
Marshmallow doesn't work well with PDF Max Pro.,Yes
"I would rate it with fewer stars if I could. Not compatible with the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. Emailing a developer is ineffective. Updated in December 2015, however they are still taking donations. Numerous more who have the same issue. If you're willing to take the chance of purchasing this program, I'd advise you to email the creator beforehand to make sure you can get support if something goes wrong. Avoid this stuff if possible.",Yes
"My new tablet has Marshmallow operating system. Every time I try to read a file into the app, I receive the message ""invalid file,"" which suggests that the app has been abandoned. Since I just checked my phone, which also has Marshmallow, and it displays the same message, this issue is not limited to tablets. I believe it will no longer be effective for me.",Yes
"I made an effort to view things favorably. However, I eventually gave up. I was reading a pdf file while underlining, highlighting, commenting, and taking notes. I was surprised when it began to crash on page 9 of the 10 page document. Before this, whenever I tried to write something, the tablet would freeze and I would have to wait around 40 seconds for it to react. The worst aspect is that only the highlights and comments are kept if you want to open this document using Adobe Reader. I cleared the tablet's memory, halted background processes, and removed and reinstalled software, but that didn't help either. I can't believe I just spent two hours studying this crucial document again. I'm extremely sorry about it. You need to correct it.",Yes
"won't load multiple 250 MB magazines that EZPDF Reader and Adobe, which aren't their bloated, useless selves on Android, can handle without a problem.",Yes
"B & N HD+ running Android 4.4.3. Android 4.4.4 on the Samsung Galaxy 2. Despite being packed with many excellent features, it is unable to successfully read PDF files. It's possible that this software has too much maximum functionality and insufficient basic functionality, or that 280 MB of RAM is insufficient to load a 250 MB file. Regardless, this software does not support huge files (Consumer Reports, etc). On the FAOTD, I received this for free. I don't like this ridiculous software, to put it simply.",Yes
"App is broken. It hasn't for more than a year at this point. No reaction to reports of crashes and not maintained by developer. No website and invalid email. I have an unlocked HTC 10 running Android 8.0 Oreo. Over a year ago, I tried it and gave the latest OS upgrade a chance, but it still doesn't work. ASAP UNINSTALL. I believe it won't work for me in the future; you might like it, but I don't. Because It appears that after updating to Android 6 PDF Max Pro stopped working and now simply displays a ""invalid file"" error for ANY PDF I attempt to open. I'm happy I got this for free rather than being tricked into purchasing it.",Yes
"frequently crashes. even after restarts, cannot open. No possibility of refund. I'll update to mention one issue I came into. The pdf files of sheet music do not appear to open properly in this application. Similar problems also occurred with other apps (Adobe app works). Other than that, I continue to be pleased with how well this software performs. crashed",Yes
"opens.pdf files far more quickly and effectively than the Adobe program. If you work with.pdf files at all, you absolutely need to have this program. Performance is amazing when I use it on a Hisense Sero-7-Pro. EDIT: I'd like to mention one issue I came into. The pdf files of sheet music do not appear to open properly in this application. Similar problems also occurred with other apps (Adobe app works). Other than that, I remain concerned about how well this software will perform down the road.",Yes
"After upgrading to Marshmallow, I started getting the ""invalid file"" error whenever I tried to open any pdf file with PDF Max Pro. I recently upgraded to crying, but the problem still exists. What was previously a really helpful app is now completely useless. I suppose I'll have to uninstall it at this point and give up on it. death occurred at March 4, 2017 11:39.",Yes
DON'T WASTE YOUR FOUR DOLLARS. APP NEVER EVEN OPENES. Why is there no option for a refund like on standard Android smartphones. SCAM,Yes
"Many of the features are not to my taste. Actually, I had only begun to become comfortable with the software when I encountered a significant issue. Without internet access, it won't function. Though I'm removing it, I might never find out if this will be changed in a later release. If you always have connection to the internet, this app might be right for you; otherwise, pass until an update fixes it.",Yes
"I found it quite simple to utilize this small software. I'm having a serious problem with it on my Galaxy Tab S, though. When I make a change to a document and select to save it, the app shuts down with the notice that PDF MAX has stopped functioning. I was able to insert and save an image using the stamp tool. I have trouble when I use the free text tool and then try to save my modifications. Without success, I tried saving at other places, saving as different locations, and saving to the default location. not work downloaded and deleted due to a difficulty with the layout. Additionally, I experienced a ""invalid file when trying to open"" issue. Please solve this, thanks.",Yes
This app is impossible to use. There doesn't seem to be a method to find my docs anywhere. A complete waste of money and a scan,Yes
"I used to enjoy this program and reinstalled it in the hopes that they would correct the issue because I appreciate the capabilities of this app. However, the app occasionally displays invalid file while attempting to open practically any PDF. It's quite useful to have for editing PDF files. But I fail to see why the most recent change necessitates reading user identities. Until they explain the rationale behind the requirement or remove it. Sorry, just 2 seem worthy to me. It irritates me.",Yes
"Despite numerous uninstall/reinstall cycles, it has continually showed the INVALID FILE issue for more than a year, even on my Galaxy 7.",Yes
"Garbage. I can't open any pdf files because they all say ""invalid file."" Thieves. Fearing it",Yes
This just stopped working after I downloaded it.,Yes
I download and install the software but when I click to open I get a notice something like camelia.com quit working. I tried multiple times and I still got the same problem message. This is the paid version,Yes
Don't spend your money. It doesn't work at all. This program does not seem to operate with all PDF files,Yes
"Terrible purchase. Does nothing that the Free version doesn't do. Bought it so that I could save flattened documents it continuously crashes or freezes while trying to do this, or reports issues.",Yes
This program doesn't appear to want to work well with the Samsung Tablet I have..... I can't truly judge the software since my tablet will not let it run,Yes
Continually crashes as soon as I try to open a file. Developer cannot be contacted. I loved this product for a bit but it's no longer worth money if it can't be corrected and I can't even inform the creator what is occurring. I don't advocate buying this in light of their being no practical way to contact the developer.,Yes
"This is the weakest of the pdf apps I've tried, and most pricey. I expected for the money to receive greater functionality. Instead it has less. You can't even resize text annotations-how foolish. Don't spend your money.",Yes
Not a bad program bit I can not find a way to contact the developer to report an issue. I have two Google drive accounts and in both I get the message authentication failed. .. There is some kind of bug. No difficulty with the other cloud services. I hope copy could be added in the cloud services.,Yes
This program doesn't work with Dropbox (or any cloud service as far as I'm aware) which renders it entirely worthless. I wasted 4.,Yes
"I have a lot of problema with it, the app crashes constantly on mi Kindle fire hd.",Yes
App doesn't work properly on my Kindle Fire HDX. When first installed it worked. After I closed & reopened the app it stopped working.. When I open a document it closes the app. Uninstall & reinstall made no difference.,Yes
"Every time I attempt to open a PDF file, I receive a *invalid file* alert, and then the program quickly closes. Call me crazy, but I'm pretty sure PDFs are what this program is meant for. I have tried various PDF files, all with the same outcomes. These files open completely well in every other Office/PDF app out there, just not this one. I have even uninstalled and then reinstalled twice, with no luck. I have tried contacting customer service, but have not received a reply. I will give this app 5 stars when the creator eventually helps to solve this problem.",Yes
"I have tried a few various PDF readers, and I believe that this one is superior. The documents load quickly and simply. The only problem occurs when you decide to save them; computer aware people will know to click on the 3-dot-link, but others may find themselves re-downloading a document that is already in the memory (only in the temporary files) (just in the temporary files). I had to explain the method to my spouse, which is why I have only awarded 4 stars.",Yes
I can't seem to find out how to close the PDFs after they are open. The file menu offers everything but close exit quit or load. I guess it's fortunate that there are so many crashes. Completely unstable in its current state with Kindle HDX. Got the software for free in a kindle Appstore deal.,Yes
2. can't edit pdf like delete pages of add pages or add files...,Yes
"it doesn't function on toshiba prosper, slow at start, certain pdfs won't openyou can't beat MuPDF this could useful to modify, but it won't open several of my docs. I removed it",Yes

Program doesn't work. Contact with company by email a website failed.,Yes
I was unable to completely try out the app. I could not choose and annotate the first page simply. Every time I try to change the annotation I can only see page 2. Then I couldn't see page one. Scrolling didn't function. Using a stylus doesn't help.,Yes
"not Easy to use. I was unable to make the simplest update to my PDF, I don’t think it will work for me",Yes
Useless. I was unable to make the simplest edit to my PDF. Wish I could get my money back but Amazon makes it difficult.,Yes
"Installed 1st on my moto g and it worked. But doesn't operate on my tablet, LG GPad where I would utilize it. Unfortunately pdfmax has stopped. That's the error I get. And I don't even need to open any pdf. If I navigate using my explorer or pdf max I get this problem.",Yes
There are just too many PDF documents that other apps can open but this one can't.,Yes
"My only issue with this otherwise fantastic program is that it doesn't support printing. I must therefore have two PDF apps. Adobe Reader for printing and this for editing. If this issue is fixed, the rating will be five stars.",Yes
"I don't like this program. It was initially highly effective before suddenly going haywire. Problem is, I spent $3.99 for this and would like a refund.",Yes
"I don't understand why app developers keep adding new permission requirements without bothering to explain them. One can only presume it's done intentionally. The once-respectable software will be automatically uninstalled from my device unless the new permissions are explained. I won't be updating till then, too. Your preference",Yes
"It was a waste of money to buy it. When I attempt to open a file, the software terminates my session.",Yes
"My Nexus 7 (2013-Wifi Only Tablet) modified the PDF file's original Font style while opening it. The file does not show up in its initial state. Reading eventually devolves into pathetic. My uncle's Samsung Galaxy E7 smartphone is free of this issue. There, this software is operating normally. Fix this problem as soon as possible.",Yes
"I adore this app, however if the creator can fix this issue soon, I'll alter my rating to a 4. It will receive a 5 for speed control.",Yes
"Up until I modified the permissions to include storage, I was getting a ""invalid file"" issue. Now, whenever I try to open any PDF, it simply crashes.",Yes
"The auto-open feature of this app is no longer functional due to the most recent update. The app displays the message ""Invalid File"" while attempting to open a pdf from an email, etc. When the pdf file is opened directly from the app, everything goes smoothly. The software is feature-rich, but until this problem is resolved, I can only give it a rating of 2 stars because it cannot be used as a complete PDF solution.",Yes
unable to understand how to use it. I grade this poorly since I can't locate any instructions. not simple to use,Yes
"Although I recently paid for and downloaded this app, my Kindle Fire HD is unable to run it. If there was a manner I could see of returning it for a refund, I would do so.",Yes
"whenever you attempt to open a PDF, a crash occurs. Useless, sorry I accidentally received this. Crashes when opened. Waste of money because I have no idea how to use it, and the directions aren't really that useful.",Yes
Waste of Time was a free download that I am unable to remove.,Yes
Time waster. Any annotations you've done are lost because it keeps crashing.,Yes
Installed incorrectly. Unhappy obviously because unable to use or even uninstall. Also Layout is extremely challenging to use,Yes
"Time waster in my opinion, however it's free, so make your own judgment.",Yes
"At initially, the possibility to earn credits through commercials and videos seemed fantastic. However, despite my best efforts, I was unable to gain credits through the surveys, so my only option was to purchase credits. Not likely to occur. Uninstalling. Scam",Yes
"unable to understand how to use it. It's extremely difficult to use the layout. Make it simple, please.",Yes
Time was wasted and it didn't work. never regularly worked,Yes
"I can still use the app even if it says ""install,"" therefore I can't delete it.",Yes
unable to make it operate.,Yes
unable to make it operate. The amount of random text was excessive. It's been removed already.,Yes
"This one is still beyond our comprehension. If we don't use it, we lose it, it keeps saying. We just received it. I still can't figure out how to video chat.",Yes
"It's so annoying that every time I sign out, it forces me to sign back in, only to delete all of my prior messagesóincluding any new ones I have just received and haven't had a chance to read. Now, when I start the app, all it displays is a text that is now transmitting that I sent early yesterday morning, and it won't allow me do anything else. I have used the repair app tool numerous times, and the problems have been reported to customer service. We are uninstalling this application. Just to send texts is so annoying to deal with. A waste of time.",Yes
"When I didn't even call anyone, they refused to give me credits, even though I could have needed this for 2-step verification. I decided to use the ""free"" software. But that is untrue. It costs money. It costs four for one text message. That's far from being free. That is a scam. I could purchase a burner phone from a dollar store for $10 a month with unlimited texting. However, I don't desire a cell phone. I suppose it implies I won't be able to use the internet anymore when two-step verifications are in use. Without a doubt, I won't choose to do business with a firm that misrepresents its pricing. That must be prohibited, and Amazon must take down their app from the Fire store. False advertising is unacceptable. Low value is incorrect. Why there are nice reviews here is beyond me. It's all paid for, I believe.",Yes
"I can't even get this software to open. It just states, ""TextMe has ceased operating,"" and I'm unable to even send texts from it. The download ended at that point. Terrific Not even one star should be given to it.",Yes
Unable to run after installation and receiving no error messages,Yes
Unable to comprehend. I don't require directions.,Yes
"I can't obtain a ringtone for my Kindle, therefore I never know when a call comes in. Perhaps because of this, I don't like it.",Yes
"I haven't encountered any significant problems while using this software to text on a Kindle Fire for a while. My contacts and recent texts take a while to load when I start the app on occasion, as though it was caught off guard. I haven't lost any of my contacts or texts. I haven't placed any calls through the app.",Yes
"There are too many advertisements that children can access, and you can't SMS them on your ownóyou need the app.",Yes
"I loved it but now the update won't function and I can't even obtain a new number because I had to erase it, so you shouldn't have altered it. It was significantly better before.",Yes
ignored the impending messages or calls alert,Yes
"kindly assist My number is flashing adverts and it's informing me that it's expired, but when I try to pay for the monthly unlimited upgrade (again), Amazon says that I already have a subscription. I am therefore trapped. cannot place a call. You can't use my number. And what's worse is that it hasn't been the first time for me. The previous time, I had to change my number completely. Sounds easy enough, however the fact that you can't save any contacts makes it a major inconvenience. It follows that whenever you get a new number, you must enter the numbers of everyone you speak to, start a new chat thread, and inform them of the change so they know it's you. That is simply way too much work, especially considering that I already have the 4.99 upgrade that states I can ""Keep my number, dial unrestricted numbers, and skip ads Once more, I'm helpless; I can't upgrade, and I can't place calls. incredibly irritated Please address the problem that is causing this.",Yes
"I've had it for two months, but all of a sudden I can't send any texts. Support was contacted, but they also appeared unable to assist.",Yes
"I purchased this with the idea that it would allow me to access my standard messages on my Fire tablet. You are instead given a new phone number. Since it's free, I don't mind the ads as much as other reviewers do. However, the fact that you can't add contacts unless they also use the service means that if you want to text someone, you'll need to manually enter their number and identify yourself because the text will be coming from a different number than your cell phone. It's not really useful. I have NO IDEA how it amassed so many 5-star reviews, but I suspect something is off.",Yes
"Even though the offerings are free, they are all rip-offs that will only waste your time. It also slows down my operating system and has several bugs. AVOID DOWNLOADING Infection haven",Yes
One problem is that it doesn't work without WiFi. reduces the need for a cell phone bill for those with tight budgets.,Yes
"I only gave it a four star rating since I can't currently use the text feature; perhaps after an update, I will.",Yes
"I can just text me; I can't call."" I have to use a phone number instead of names to identify the people I'm texting, but at least I can text them.",Yes
"Can't log in; every time I try, the software crashes or shuts. Pretty amusing for a Kindle software.",Yes
"It kind of works. You can phone and text, but you must endure a TON of advertisements. Since I don't have a phone, I obtained this number thinking that if I went to a friend's house or anything, I could take my kindle and be able to call/text my parents if something happened. WRONG. It will bombard you with messages about how they are going to delete your number or why you should go premium when verified emails save numbers if you don't call or text for about a month. I enter my email address and confirm it, but a few days later when I try to use it, it says that my number is ""expired."" I spend a lot of time setting up a new number and double-checking my email address, and guess what? The next time I try to use it, my number is once more deleted. So, yes, it is free to phone and text, but you will need to get a new number fairly frequently if you don't use it frequently or give them a lot of money. If you don't plan to phone or text every day or so, then using this app will essentially be a waste of time.",Yes
I haven't had a chance to try this app because my Kindle has been giving me problems. I dislike it,Yes
"Thank you! I really enjoy this app, but you only get ten calls, and you have to earn more by watching videos, which doesn't work when you click the button to do so.",Yes
I'm having to memorize everyone's phone number so that I can text the right person because I can't seem to add names to the phone numbers that I text.,Yes
"Received the error message ""Stopped,"" annoying app, just too many ads added. This worked on my phone before but not well on my son's tablet.",Yes
I was unable to get it to function on my Samsung tablet.,Yes
I was unable to get to it. They request far too much personal data. seems to have a systemic flaw. l,Yes
My daughter adores it a lot. One issue is that the Kindle Fire edition does not support Chromecast.,Yes
"It was quite difficult to use, and I was unable to get it to operate with my tablet. I uninstalled it and will try another product.",Yes
"This application keeps closing and is unable to open an account, making it useless. Fix is required if on the application list.",Yes
"I had previously used this software on the same device at a different time. I downloaded it to use it again, however it is currently unresponsive. With the previous download, the account could send texts and make phone calls and was functional. I even paid to secure the phone number, but it is completely useless now. Despite my best efforts and debugging, I am unable to send it or receive messages from anyone, and it won't allow me to make it receive any phone calls. Wishing it would Therefore, don't squander your time, money, or effort. Even tried to get in touch with the devs, but I couldn't stand this program. I deleted my account from this app after using it for a while. The app then refused to allow me create an account when I downloaded it to a separate device.",Yes
"WORKED NOTHING AT ALL Then I was unable to log into my account; evidently password resets take a LONG time, so I am still locked out. We tried unsuccessfully for hours to text each other. We detest this. aggravation a thousand times Uninstalling.",Yes
"Needs an update; I may have tried deleting it and resetting my password without success. You start out with a limited number of credits, but you must pay 7.99 to make more texts or calls. Check the fine print.",Yes

not effective enough to even be bothered. How to connect if you can't,Yes
"disliked it and never used it, How to connect if you can't",Yes
"both also Unable to connect; I have no idea how to connect. Fix it, please.",Yes
"I'm not sure how well it functions because when I tested it, I only got one reply and haven't had any more since. Because I won't give up my unlimited data plan, Verizon charges me for texting. Instead, I was hoping that this would work, but I've had limited success.",Yes
Has too many issues. Please make the layout easy,Yes

It was easy to use and the only big problem was the pop ups.,Yes

I can't sign in with an email you have to receive a number that it gives you. Struggling and perplexed.,Yes
"I like this software, but it freezes on me sometimes so I either can't text or the screen just goes black. That's what got it at 3 stars",Yes
"Couldn't get it figured out, had problems w/ trying to sign in, kept saying either email or password was not correct, then tried to open it all over again, I would try my email & password again, then it would say, "" already n use"", just kept trying, but eventually got tired w/ it & left it alone.",Yes
"I did not like it,Couldn't get it to work\sI can't receive photographs.",Yes
"Fun I can't text my buddies who use their mothers' phones, but I can text them on my Fire Kindle in front of their mothers. It's a shame since after installing the software on my Kindle, I was unable to make or receive calls. I then gave my iphone a go and had a similar result. An app killer is that obnoxious red message alert. It's a virus if you can't remove it without paying credits, in my opinion. Earn my business by your goods, not its trappings. will remove.",Yes
"Since he has an outdated phone, my spouse purchased this so he can text our children. But it required access to information of all kinds, which he felt uncomfortable providing. Why does it need his location and access to so many other pieces of information, passwords, etc. when all he wants to do is send a text message? He blew it away since it seemed strange.",Yes
Did not work; I was unable to click on the app's picture.,Yes
I can't rate it because I've never used it.,Yes
"Limited instructions, couldn't get it to work, didn't like",Yes
"My phone ran out of battery life and I neglected to charge it, so I used this for today. You must invite all of your friends. Therefore, I was unable to simply contact someone to let them know I would be unavailable but could be reached at home if necessary. But you can't do that with this app without going through the process of inviting them, getting them to sign up, etc., making it a slow way to contact people.",Yes
"I enjoy it, but I can't get pictures.",Yes
"I downloaded it, but I was unable to read the text.",Yes
I was unable to make it work.,Yes
I uninstalled it since I was unable to get a phone number.,Yes
fails miserably; I can't even sign in.,Yes
"I really want to know whether anyone else experiences the issue of certain people's texts disappearing after a short while. After a couple of weeks of working, I have a ton of folks whose SMS don't arrive. I really want this fixed since I hate that it has virtually stopped working. Aside from that, I adore this app. Although horrible, the call might be used in an emergency. I would Adore LOVE LOVE if you could fix it because I love the messaging feature when it works. Many thanks. - User, text me.",Yes
"It was quite helpful when my iPhone died. The only problem was that I had to be connected to WiFi in order to make a call, but because there are so many hot-spots now, I can live with that.",Yes
"I enjoyed Text+, but I can't get it anymore. I don't like the way Text Me is set up.",Yes
I can't sign in because it keeps logging me out.,Yes
"Somehow, it changed our phone number. and stopped texting a different person. Scared me; I won't use again.",Yes
"It is problematic since it forbids you from using a password or email, and it constantly informs you that TextMe has slowed down before taking an hour to download. I advise against downloading this app because it will only add to your tension.",Yes
"Actually, I'm deleting it because it doesn't work.",Yes
"However, I deleted it because I don't want to pay to phone or text anybody when I run out of money and am unable to call or text anyone. I want it to be free.",Yes
"This app is amazing. I'm currently unable to use my cell phone due to technical difficulties. This saves lives. The only thing is that while I can share photographs, it appears that I cannot receive them. Otherwise, I'd want to thank Amazon.",Yes
"I have no idea how this software is the ""Kindle Fire Edition,"" for the life of me. I can only download it, though. I attempted to download this software to our Kindle Fire for the second time. It can launch the application, but after that it freezes. Time and effort wasted.",Yes
Can't hear someone on the other line when it's on speaker,Yes
Kind of slow but gets the job done. Calling doesn't work,Yes
This is NOT free to use. Worked good for months on the premium plan and then all of a sudden stopped ringing when I received calls.,Yes
It was nearly tough to use or to figure out. Did not enjoy it one bit. Also didn't know when it was on or off. Just terrible\sdidn't work at all. Worked perfectly for months on the premium plan and then all of a sudden stopped ringing when I received calls,Yes
"Textme is clunky at best and tries to rob you at it's worst. Worked good for months on the premium plan and then all of a sudden stopped ringing when I received calls. Customer care is non-existent and the software seems meant to deceive you into into buying credits, even when you're paying for the premium service. I wish I had gotten rid of it sooner",Yes
"This is a bad app. My 9 year old daughter was so pleased to finally have a ""phone number"" so she could communicate with family from her tablet, but it stopped taking messages from them very shortly after setting it up. This was just a complicated and unpleasant mess. Don't get this.",Yes
Worked perfectly for months on the premium plan and then all of a sudden stopped ringing when I received calls,Yes
You can't top it for FREE. You merely have to be near a WIFI location to use it. The one draw back for me is I didn't use it often enough. After a couple of weeks of none use you lose the dedicated number and your contacts have to learn the new number you obtain the next time you use the app.,Yes
The entire EMOJI situation is not even amusing because you can't use the EMOJIs. It's not even amusing.,Yes
"Up until yesterday's fresh update, this app was in excellent working order. Yesterday, it wouldn't open and was simply loading, so I had to uninstall it and re-download it. Then, after I was able to log in, I was unable to send texts. I thought there was a problem with my iPad, but there wasn't. I can tell from reading these reviews that everyone is having the same issues. Fix it",Yes
"It once worked for me. After that, I was unable to get it to log in again. even with a full charge on my Kindle.",Yes
Both the app and the number of calls you can make are limited. Get Skype if you want a hip texting app.,Yes
"I bought this program so my daughter could use her Fire tablet to text me and her family members. After a few weeks, the phone number abruptly changed, and she started getting bizarre, random texts and voicemails from unknown callers. Since it wasn't a financial investment for us, I can't say that I was wasting money, but the thought that your children would be receiving frightening calls meant for the person who had the number before them is more than enough of a reason to deactivate the app. Why does a messaging app permit voicemails and why would the phone number change?",Yes
IS UNABLE TO SEE OR RETAIN PASSWORD INFORMATION. IT SEEMS TO BE STILL BUG. I dislike it,Yes
"It would only let me send one text message before telling me I needed credits to continue. The list of things you can do and the number of credits you can earn is then provided. I took surveys because you could make a lot of money there. I should have gotten at least 40 credits for my three lengthy assignments. When I return to the software, it indicates that I earned 15 Such a waste of time",Yes
"Up until yesterday, it was the best texting app ever. It was working perfectly until yesterday when it stopped delivering messages. If it starts working again, I'll give it a five-star rating.",Yes
"Where are the videos for credits? Every time I try to view them for credits, it doesn't work and automatically turns to offers.",Yes
"It was ambiguous if it was free or not. When exhibiting a ""points"" system along with charges, I'm afraid of hidden fees. I'm on a fixed income, so I obviously can't utilize it if there's a fee.",Yes
This app is stupid because you can't receive any credits through video.,Yes
"I was never able to progress past the sign-in, so this review is unfair. The sign-up process felt excessively intrusive, and I later had to register with a new phone number. Just so I can text with my pals who use Apple goods, this seemed like a little too much. All of this can be a misinterpretation of how the Fire functions. I'm prepared to spend a little bit extra right now and purchase an iPad mini.",Yes
"Seriously, do not waste your money using this app.",Yes
"I only noticed it as a typical app where I could video chat, though. I own a kindle HD, and it doesn't work. When I select a free account, texting me stops. Sign in; stop texting me. Can anyone explain what transpired?",Yes
"It says free, but I had to purchase minutes. I only used it for texting, not calling, but after a limited amount of texting, it needed to be purchased.",Yes
"I was unable to enter my phone number because of an area code error. My location has a different area code than I do. I couldn't fix it, so I deleted the application.",Yes
I was unable to get it to function on my Kindle Fire.,Yes
"They claimed that this app was free, but I have other VOIP and texting apps that work just as well. You can't text or email this one.",Yes
no usage guidelines. I was unable to make it operate.,Yes
"I'm not too happy with the app now that I've downloaded it for my Kindle Fire. Without using their emails (which would eventually saturate them with spam), which I will not do, I am unable to create contacts. Although it is not very user friendly, my son enjoys texting my family and friends. Since I don't have many options on the Kindle, I'm going to keep it for the time being. TextMe will be removed once I discover a replacement.",Yes
No new contacts may be added. I can only call folks who have the app because I can't get my personal phone number through it.,Yes
Too complicated to understand. I can only call folks who have the app because I can't get my personal phone number through it.,Yes
"One-way text communication was possible, but the recipient was unable to reply. I worry about texting a complete stranger.",Yes
"I am unable to view the other person's text messages. Says This application set a very high bar but never jumped it. When I attempted to open it, it would crash and keep requesting an update. After a day, delete this to avoid wasting space. Not compatible with my Kindle Fire 8.9",Yes
"Since I invested money in this software, it is annoying that my login doesn't work.",Yes
"I was unable to get it to work on a Fire HD 8. (2016). I restarted it once and got it to function. After that, despite numerous resets and reinstalls, I was unable to log back into the account.",Yes
"On a Kindle Fire, I was unable to get it to operate. Time waster. I'm angry.",Yes
"On our son's Kindle, we downloaded this program, but because we have Parental Controls on, he is unable to access the web browser. He was able to access You Tube by clicking on an ad in this app. He utilized this software to see porn. It is disheartening that neither the Kindle Fire parental controls nor this app were able to ban it. I'm furious about it; could you kindly fix this app?",Yes
"At first, it was operating smoothly. However, I soon logged off. And now it continues to malfunction. like when I try to log in. And as soon as it occurs, I'm automatically logged out once more. Fix it. I've started texting some essential folks. Wtf, this app is terrible. I can't even phone anyone because of that.",Yes
had issues sending and receiving text messages.,Yes
I'm not a fan of this app. You are unable to contact your friends and family.,Yes
"I was unable to send or receive text messages on my Kindle. I've tried a lot of things, and I wouldn't attempt this one again.",Yes
"Calls are not always obvious on this application, which is only fair. I am unable to remove contacts from my contact list, and when I call my husband's number, Amazon Marketplace appears. It is disappointing since despite upgrading in the hopes of receiving better service, things really became worse. I'm seriously considering switching...",Yes
"I've been using this software on my Kindle for at least a year at this point. However, it started to produce pop-up advertisements in my browser around two days ago. And it spams them in a manner akin to that of a computer virus. Additionally, it only occurs when I have this app open in case you're worried that the problem is with the program rather than a virus. Which indicates that it is somehow related to this program. This review would have been much higher if they fixed whatever the problem is.",Yes
"This app is awful. When someone calls, You can't even pick up the phone with it. Simply a dark screen with no content. The app connects you to the call when the call is disconnected. It really annoys me. When you click the app, you can use it. It might launch the app right away. But the majority of the time, it returns you to the home screen. The tablet might be the only one affected, but the phone could also be. I'm over it.",Yes
I don't love it because I can't send messages or save contacts.,Yes
"I'm unable to make it function. On my HD Kindle, I attempted to install Open Garden, but it did not function.",Yes
"not be compatible with my Kindle HD tablet. numerous times, yet the problem of not being able to install persisted. very dissatisfied",Yes
"That's a terrible app. Even if you renew the text me number, you are unable to send any messages.",Yes
"When I enter the number, it appears for one second before disappearing, and I am unable to text ANYONE.",Yes
"I was being terrorized by someone who was following me and wouldn't let up, saying things like, ""I know where you are, and I can't get rid of them.""",Yes
"I really don't like it, but I wish that you could receive verification codes by text messages when you want to log in to anything and you need a verification code, but they can't send it to your email.",Yes
"It's absolutely awful that you can't contact, text, or FaceTime your buddies. However, I must say that it contains a lot of advertising and is rather difficult to grasp. But aside from that, I don't like it.",Yes
"I have no issues using this software on my phone, but I am unable to get it to function with my Kindle. I feel as though something is missing. like a working Internet connection is insufficient. Any suggestions? I'll update my stars once it starts working for me.",Yes
"I was wondering how to text but it's okay, but I can't text my mom and I can't text when I go anywhere on the bottom it says FAILED.",Yes
It doesn't work. All mails that use 1+area code fail.,Yes
"Be careful using this software since it might be the Devil Child for my Kindle Fire 8.9, which kept stating that it had stopped.",Yes
Please address the issue since I adore the app but I can't text my best friend any longer.,Yes
"I could only use TextMe after downloading it if I paid 4.99 per week or 8.99 per month. What is unlocked? I am unable to enter anyone's name, let alone their home or cell numbers or addresses. For me, it is completely pointless. I wonder whether it has anything to do with my issue of receptive processing. Almost everything I try and fail at, I miss out on. I'm over it. I discover they are billing me 59 each month two days afterwards. If I knew how, I'd file a lawsuit. They get away with it in this way. What BS",Yes
"Up until recently, it operated without issue, but it now repeatedly displays pop-up advertisements.",Yes
"It has everything I need, but the speaker doesn't function, you can't use FaceTime unless you both have the app, and you get calls later than they contact you. This is fantastic because you can text and call.",Yes
"The worst application I've ever paid for and downloaded is this one. They canceled my account for strange activity the moment I had problems logging on, costing me thousands of dollars due to the lost business relationships I had built up. Watch out for the terms of use; they'll use them as an excuse to cheat you out of your money. I repeat: don't use this app; it's a scam.",Yes
"This app is awful. I've made three attempts to link it. My email is deemed invalid, it says. My cell phone won't work there. I notify it that I need a new password when I try to log in. After asking for my email, it notifies me that it is invalid. Instead of utilizing my number, it has given me an other one to use. I am unable to amend or correct my information. Absolutely useless",Yes
"This app has always been my favorite, but since the most recent update, I can't text anyone.",Yes
"advertised at the Kindle Store, but the support topics are irrelevant. The help options do not mention the Kindle Fire, which is my first straightforward issue. I'm getting nothing for what I've already paid.",Yes
"The app requests that I pay 5 credits for each and every SMS I attempt to send, despite repeatedly stating in their descriptions that you can TEXT COST-FREE [""Free Texting (real SMS messages) to any Phone number in the United States, Canada, and 40 countries.""]. All of this was sent from the US-based number they gave me (213-375-xxxx) to a number of other US numbers I tried to text. I won't waste time describing the numerous other user-interface issues that exist ó I am not a volunteer beta tester. The app will be removed from my Kindle Fire in less than a minute.",Yes
"The help options do not mention the Kindle Fire, which is my first straightforward issue. I am getting nothing for my money thus far, and I was unable to log in because the website loads so slowly. Additionally, I have heard that calls can only be made occasionally per month, so I advise against downloading this app because it is terrible.",Yes
"The help options do not mention the Kindle Fire, which is my first straightforward issue. I'm getting nothing for what I've already paid.",Yes
"The issue began when my account was unable to receive calls. Big mistake, I created a phone number for my business using the app. I posted the phone number all over the city on signs and on the website. My business completely slowed down because I couldn't answer calls. I was unable to get in touch with anyone at the business. I sent over ten emails, but I kept getting the same canned response. I advise you to avoid using this company if you intend to do anything significant with it. I spent a lot of time and money on this.",Yes
All were put to use for a while before the incoming calls stopped.,Yes
The only issue I have with it is how poorly it manages group texts.,Yes
"The app doesn't recognize their Bluetooth headset as being connected, which is the only issue.",Yes
"bro, it's not working. The app doesn't recognize their Bluetooth headset as being connected, which is the only issue. Just fix it",Yes
"Can't get it to work and it's a junk app. a surplus of advertisements. It was rather annoying, but I downloaded it so I could talk to my schoolmate. and when I exited the app, I was in the middle of a challenging game, and it proceeded to text me for no apparent reason while claiming that ""your camera and flash light are in use by another app."" I don't even have a camera or flashlight on this.",Yes
You must MODIFY YOUR NUMBER. I don't like that. I was unable to register using my email address either. Not suggested.,Yes
"I added this by accident not realizing it wasn't actually SNAPCHAT and nothing but perverts add you and now I can't stop it. I hate it and wish I could take my username off your location can be tracked by anyone on this app- very scary- children under 18, and anyone not rational over 18 should beware.",Yes
"Don't download this app because it's bad and it doesn't work. I wish it did because it would be a lot of fun, but the app won't be worth your time to download. because it is ineffective. Gratitude - Amazon User",Yes
Downloading it is pointless and a waste of time. I regret finding it because I can't access the internet anymore; could you please explain how to undownload it?,Yes
I repeat NOT Avoid wasting time using this app. Completely pointless. SnapChat is not it. Why can't we have the real thing?,Yes
"Very bad Every time I try to create an account, it will first ask for a list of characters, and then when I press the next button, it will ask me to complete a series of stupid tests to ensure that I am not a robot. As a result, I am unable to even create an account. Please, Amazon, make Snapchat real. I despise it because it's difficult to sign up. I tried to create my account, but it's all BS, don't download this app. I wish we had Snapchat on our Amazon tablets.",Yes
"VERY BAD APP, you can't change anything, and whenever you want to access another page, it asks you to verify that you are not a robot. The names were also extremely offensive; I can't think of even one example. I cite again, There's a reason your tablets cost $50; it's a VERY BAD APP, SO GIVE US REAL SNAPCHAT, AMAZON.",Yes
"This app is the worst and I detest it. It's nothing like Snap Chat; all it does is display a list of users and a question about whether or not you're a robot. If I could give it a zero, I would because it is the worst app I have ever used. All you do is compliment other users, and it is incredibly boring. THE REAL SNAPCHAT AMAZON IS GIVE.",Yes
"I don't like it, and I don't understand why regular Snap Chat can't be downloaded.",Yes
"No one likes this fake garbage from Amazon, give us the real Snap Chat. Even a developer wouldn't use this deal. It is @% trash and a waste of 3 seconds to understand it.",Yes
You're better off downloading Google Play and installing the fake version of SnapChat than doing anything else. Please don't waste your time on this.,Yes
"so stupid I hate this app because it's useless and stupid, but I keep getting snaps despite my dislike. I can't seem to stop it after someone did this to my account.",Yes
Don't waste your time downloading this app; Kindle could do much better things with the time available.,Yes
This app was completely useless. I only gave it one star because I was unable to give it zero stars.,Yes

"My computer was hacked, so I was unable to access this.",Yes
I can't even create an account. Not usable. Waste. Not what I anticipated,Yes
"This is total garbage. I don't mean to be impolite, but do you people actually read these reviews? I'm sick and tired of you guys playing games with me. And sincerely, you're going to mess with the wrong person one day and, hopefully, face legal action for your ripoffs. And I'm almost done with Amazon, so I can't wait until I get a phone. I'm unable to download even a basic app for my academic work. If it's that difficult to create real apps or are you simply too lazy to actually make things so simple, I'm getting the grade instead of you. I'm not the only one who is sick and tired of it, and this is coming from an 11-year-old who finds it sad that it has to be that way. I'm sure every person who downloaded it wants to throw their Amazon tablet, phone, or whatever out the window, and if you don't read these, get ready for a lot of freaking phone calls.",Yes
"This application is not SnapChat, nor does it give you any access to SnapChat. A complete waste of time. Thank you for nothing at all; I will never use this app. Give us the real Snapchat already! People keep adding me and sending me terrible snaps. This is bullying. If possible, please remove my snapchat username from your app or provide me with instructions on how to do it myself. I'm grateful.",Yes
"I have a Kindle Fire HDX, which is what it's made for, and it doesn't have the people I want to follow either. All I have to say is don't waste your time downloading it because it won't work and you could be playing better games instead.",Yes
"This app is fake, and you need a SnapChat account to use it. Don't waste your time getting it because it will simply be simpler to obtain the regular one if you thought you would only be able to communicate with people.",Yes
"Nothing can be done because this is so terrible. AMAZON, GIVE US THE REAL SNAPCHAT This is unfair because SnapChat is available on other devices; you are unfair.",Yes
"Amazon should just provide us with Snapchat. Since I don't own a phone and all of my friends use Snapchat, I am unable to keep up with this idiotic imitation. Just give us regular Snapchat, Amazon. As well as updating social media apps, as I receive updates about a year after they are released. Publish faster updates.",Yes
"Why is Kindle flawed? I had to download Mobogenie to obtain my snap, but it still doesn't work since I require Google Play services. You can't do anything on here. Give us what we wantóthe genuine Snapchatóand until you do, I won't buy for anything on Amazon because this is so pitiful and so lazy.",Yes
"If you can't use SnapChat on this phone, why would you use this app to make SnapChat friends?",Yes
Finding people to chose seems like a huge waste of effort in my opinion.,Yes
This software is bad; why can't Amazon at least provide the authentic Snapchat rather than fake versions that don't function? I couldn't even log in.,Yes
"Don't download this app, please. It is wasteful. Just give us the genuine Snapchat, not this nonsense, Amazon.",Yes
"I swear I'd rather spend my entire birthday budget on a phone so I can use SnapChat, download this, throw it out the window, and scream ""F U, Amazon!"" IT'S A WASTE is inoperative: ( I'm very hurt and disappointed. Why must you provide us with a subpar off-brand version, Amazon? We seek the actual thing.",Yes
"Without the real Snapchat, this app is completely useless. It's time for the app store offered to Kindle users to keep up with the times and include apps like SnapChat, Instagram, and other popular ones rather than outdated obscure ones that receive fewer than five downloads annually. I am becoming increasingly irritated and angry as a kindle user with the garbage that is being sent to me in place of the actual apps. Please stop denying us what our devoted users truly want and stop distributing complete BULLLL like this software. I'm grateful.",Yes
"Come on, we knew they had nothing, but now since it doesn't work, why can't we just do something enjoyable? A few of us maintain social lives.",Yes
"Nobody will download this app because it doesn't work, so I'll simply keep using my iPhone 5, which is much, much better. Amazon FAILS.",Yes
Why are the apps on this tablet so outdated? acquire the genuine apps This app is terrible; do not purchase it.,Yes
"It's awful. Why can't Amazon just give us Snapchat instead of these stupid, ineffective knockoffs? I'm really growing sick of Amazon. The same is true for Instagram. All of us are growing weary of this Amazon. Fix it",Yes
You are unable to access your Snap Chat account since this does not operate at all.,Yes
Even Snapchat isn't it. Yo can't create an account either.,Yes
"Cheap and disgusting, straight to the trash, money wasted",Yes
"There are no usage instructions, the app didn't start, and the screen is blank. This is a waste of time.",Yes
"Because you can't even chat, it is useless. Snap Chat is incorrect, as it was said, but students in my class have it.",Yes
"I was unable to send texts, unfortunately. wouldn't download my contacts in my personal capacity",Yes
"Refuses to labor was marked as a very unsafe program to use, therefore I removed it right away. suggest to no one.",Yes
"Since I don't yet have a phone, this stupidity doesn't work, so my mother downloaded it, however it reports that the text was not received. UGHH.",Yes
"Don't get this app because it doesn't work; it just says ""Text not sent.""",Yes
"Junk. because it uses Google's infrastructure and wants unrestricted access to my email and Google accounts, I don't need the app.",Yes
"1. The game has become unplayable and has made it impossible to save all of your progress. 2. Desire more opportunities to use or acquire gems for gaming 3. Desire additional support for level completion. 4. Customer service is effective, but if more than three or four email exchanges fail to resolve the issue, there should be a way to get personal assistance.",Yes
gets cold Third time not loading Don't waste time by moving too slowly. You cannot create an account and the page won't move.,Yes
Can't get far without assistance that is WAY too expensive; who pays $40 or more for a few extra aids?,Yes
"One of the worst examples of this game type I've ever played, in my opinion. Slow, boring, and repetitive game, plot, and aesthetics.",Yes
"Run, don't walk away from this game unless you're prepared to continue playing it till retirement. A waste of time. boring, did I mention that? You have been forewarned.",Yes
"If I didn't have issues clicking on items, the game would be a lot of fun. Every time I attempted to click something in the game, it would freeze before unfreezing, and it wasn't my computer; the problem was with the game. I finally had to uninstall it.",Yes
Too challenging for smaller kids. My 8-year-old grandson became so frustrated that he stopped playing it.,Yes
I can't access the game's current state on my new Kindle.,Yes
"On my iPad, I was unable to get it to operate. I had to remove it.",Yes
"The game is fun, but the energy recovery time is excessive. Playing the same games over and over again to acquire the necessary stuff is also boring.",Yes
"decent game, but very obvious attempt to convince you to pay real money. Limited game play unless you purchase ""energy,"" constant ""sales"" and ""deals,"" Not good",Yes
"There is just too much bullshit going on, which ruins the game. Time waster.",Yes
"Although carefully thought out and executed, the issue appears as you attempt to make significant progress. Without investing a lot of actual cash, it cannot be done. When I get there, I'm going to delete what might have been one of the best games I could have found. It's too bad.",Yes
Life and money wasted. I'm not all that like the app.,Yes
No physical altercation unable to comprehend all the upgrades.,Yes
Waste Your Money On This Money Pit Of A Game Would Not Work On My Samsung Galaxy 7,Yes
"costly and boring, did not enjoy and did not get along with this game.",Yes
A replica of Game of War. Enough said; refrain from downloading. It is wasteful.,Yes
"It was enjoyable at first, but thousands of dollars are required to maintain that enjoyment. Every week, new products are released, and unless you spend a lot of money, you can't keep up. Creativity requires genius.",Yes
Boring Nothing sets it apart from similar products in the category.,Yes
"No fun, feels like a chore trying to keep up with everything going on in the building.",Yes
"Quite enjoyable game, however it's very expensive and my Kindle Fire crashes all the time now. I honestly can't suggest it on Amazon's platform any longer because it now crashes every few minutes.",Yes
"I was using the version before the change, but it won't let me play any more. Fix the problem.",Yes
"Although I really enjoy the game, I do have two problems. The absurdly long wait times for construction, research, and other tasks, as well as the frequent pitches to buy things. Give it a try if you can get around that.",Yes
"recurring server crashes If you can't afford $100 a week, don't even bother. Be broke and have no fun at all.",Yes
"Without spending a lot of money, you can't enjoy the game. This game is designed so that you must purchase packs in order to compete and have fun playing; otherwise, you will lose due to having insufficient power.",Yes
"Things that are overpriced and quickly become obsolete. The game frequently crashes, and I frequently get kicked out. The game deletes my messages after monitoring state chat. Zero customer support. My money was completely wasted.",Yes
"This ""game"" is a depressing time waster. I believe it is appropriate to provide this review after three months of relentless pounding. Having read numerous testimonials from players I'm aware that my experience is not exceptional but rather quite typical. The players who cheat the most and spend the most money control each state. Spending more money than the other players or hacking the game to obtain stuff that would otherwise cost money are the only ways to win. The ultimate goal of the game is for each state to cooperate in order to defeat other states in point competitions. By completely demolishing their base, the petty power bullies, on the other hand, refuse to give any smaller players the chance to fully participate in the challenges. I regret downloading it. I'm glad I avoided spending money on that. Oh, right Like the Mafia, the major players try to bully and threaten smaller players into paying for theirsecurity. Customer service even supports this behavior.",Yes
"time waster with a lot of ads that offers no amusement. It's worse than Clash of Clans, which I just kind of enjoyed.",Yes
"The slow input in this game is the problem I have with it. I recently complained about not getting in-game purchases fulfilled. Still no reaction after two days. We'll see how it turns out. Many players have voiced complaints about how long it takes to complete in-game purchases made with Amazon Coin. Therefore, avoid using Amazon Coin to make purchases if you need it right away. You'll be in the clear if you don't mind waiting a few daysóno pun intended.",Yes
This is merely a cash grab. Poor performance and ongoing problems are also present.,Yes
"I have a modest amount of money invested, yet developers keep dumping stuff on us, negating the value of our investments. I stopped spending after a year and a half and protected my account.",Yes
"merely because I can't give it a star rating of zero. If you prefer to compete by spending hundreds of dollars and hours pressing buttons, just to lose to someone who has more money? And because this game is still terrible, you should find a new interest. I quit.",Yes
"If you don't want to lose hundreds of dollars, stay away from the game. No support money-hungry bastards.",Yes
"If you don't want to waste your time, do not purchase this game. I wouldn't understand it.",Yes
"There is no live assistance, huge financial waste, log-in issues, and a need to email support after the base has already been destroyed.",Yes
"This ""game"" is really robbery. DO NOT purchase this game unless you have an endless supply of cash. In essence, it is riddled with bugs, frequently crashes, and you can never advance in the game to genuinely compete unless you have $100 to spare every few days. Unquestionably NOT FREE The game's developers insist that you pay to play, but they never repair any problems, and they are certainly unhelpful when you contact them. I regret using my hard-earned money and would like it returned.",Yes
"With the essential Amazon app, things are really bad. The game worked perfectly before the ""must have app."" I am unable to stay online for an extended period of time now that the app has been loaded. Not as entertaining as the preview teasers I played prior to its release, Amazon instantly fixes the issue.",Yes
"You can only advance in this fame to a certain point before having to spend actual money. They advertise gear for the strongest, but you can only get it by purchasing ""packs,"" which is equivalent to paying with gold, but the money has no value. You only purchase the pack for the gear in order to compete with other bases without losing ground because you KNOW they have invested in the newest equipment. You spend $100 believing it would be worthwhile. Then, two days later, new ""all powerful"" gear is released, making your existing gear outdated, and you are unable to get the most recent gear without spending an additional $100. Because they want to sell you the REAL strong gear, they pitch the equipment as having a specific value before devaluing it days later without offering you a refund. It's a swindle. They are liars and thieves.",Yes
"This game is for you if you have $100 to spend every day. Mistakes, subpar performance, terrible customer service, and many other things I can't recall right now. A nice game once existed, but the game's producers' avarice destroyed it. It's not cool to pose as a free-to-play game. Avoid downloading it.",Yes
"The only regulation in Mobile Strike is to charge 99 for a ""pay to play"" system that is slightly addictive and quite expensive after a short period of time. The end-less 99 pack needs quickly render the incentives you purchase in resource packs outdated. The game is a complete imitation. No end to it. It's a game for trolls. Avoid falling for the trap.",Yes
"I might be missing the purpose, but other critics seem to be. An understatement would be ""PAY TO PLAY."" Literally, I've learned that in order to gain any amazing troops, like DELTA FORCE or Mercenaries, or anything that can successfully defend your base or attack other bases, you kind of need to reach past level 21. Guess what, even with that opulent starting package I paid 4.99 and then 19.99 for, you still need special items, like Magic Hammers, and other things to improve the base's buildings in order to reach level 21. And BRILLIANTLY, at the level 20 cutoff, boys start to turn into men, and all for the low, low sum of 99.99. I absolutely miss the days when you could buy a PC game for as little as $99.99, own it, and play it for years without having to spend any additional money. They definitely grabbed my every nickel because MOBILE STRIKE IS A MONEY PIT, a hole in the ground for your hard-earned money (actual money). I only hope that other people don't waste their time constructing bases just to discover that they WILL be destroyed, overrun, or even have your commander killed by someone who was stupid enough to pay 99.9 or more to trample over those of us who refused to do so. Simply stating, Mobile Strike is a terrible excuse for a video game. Epic has unmistakably created a platform that has made it possible for a traditional con to stoke greed. Extremely frustrating gameplay. I enjoyed playing this game for a few months back when it originally came out. I had just finished level 21 when I initially quit, and level 22 was released a short while later. To keep your forces at a level where they can be productive, there is a constant need to spend money. Typically, packets cost 99. I returned after a year, and level 60s were present. For 4.99, epic offers a catch up pack. Not bad, I believed. To get me to level 90, the subsequent bundle cost $19.00. They will start selling level 125s in three weeks. The amount of data utilized to track resources is staggering. such sums as Million, Trillion, Trillion, and Trillion (MTTT). Epic updates the game frequently, making it more and more necessary to buy new packs in order to advance to the next level. The most recent power levels are multiplied by 10 whenever a level is extended. By doing so, a person with a lesser power level has no chance of defeating a 10 times stronger foe. As a result, the 4.99 catch-up deal quickly changed to 99 packs to maintain. To be competitive in the current game, you need to take two power steps per week. I would strongly advise against playing this fictitious game.",Yes
Boring. gradual crash Avoid wasting time. I took it out right away.,Yes
"If someone with more authority decides to ban you from the game, there is nothing you can do to stop them. Otherwise, I would not have known that I had downloaded the game and was unable to use it on my Fire.",Yes
"At first, playing this game was enjoyable; I joined an alliance and made some good friends. Unfortunately, it turned into such a clear money pit after about two months that many people stopped participating since we were unable to keep up with the expenses to remain competitive. The packs initially cost $5, then $20, but they eventually rise to $100 and then $200. At a particular level, certain game objects are required for advancement but may only be acquired by buying a pack. This is simply my assessment of the game; I strongly advise checking other reviews from other people before downloading.",Yes
"The only cost is the download, and that's about it. The game reaches a stage where you have to start purchasing items to continue playing. There are many things you can't accomplish in this game without buying things, unlike some games where you can play the game but speed it up with purchases. The purchases are also pricey. They frequently advertise packets that typically sell for 99.99 apiece. Not even one pack will do. Additionally, there is a nonstop barrage of pack advertisements. A lot of bugs might be found in the game at times. Finally, they continuously increasing the amount of resources and actual time required to complete tasks, to the point that eventually they would require billions or quadrillions of resources and trillions of days to complete if you did not purchase speedups from them. Even just the math is becoming quite difficult. I play because I've already made some pals and don't want to lose them. However, I regret that I even started. This game is terrible, buddy.",Yes
It is extremely pitiful that a game with this much market longevity has so serious stability problems. It frequently crashes on different Android smartphones. Unacceptable in every way. The game is a ridiculous waste due to the terrible stability and the fact that you essentially need to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in order to not be a doormat. Make no effort.,Yes
"Every single review I've read is accurate. This game is a massive fraud designed to drain you of your hard-earned cash. Don't be misled. They don't give a damn about you, your gaming experience, or anything like. Intense lag and problems make competing impossible and agonizingly irritating. If you spend even 500 US Dollars every week, you are a little fish. Customer service, or the lack thereof, is pure horse feces. group litigation Whoever's Lawgroup decides to actually take this to court has the right to do so. I hope you take them to the cleaners like they have been taking us for the past three years or so. Bravo and thank you. We're all willing to sign up to sue these scumbags in court and get our money back where it belongs. DO NOT. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME, I SAY.",Yes
Don't waste your time and money on it; the folks who created it just intended to profit from it. You cannot move about the site without it taking hours or all night to complete a single upgrade or construction.,Yes
"To keep up with releases, one must spend too much time releasing. There are currently a lot of troops, but they are unable to engage in any activities since they must constantly protect themselves. As a result, there is no enjoyment to be had without spending a lot of money.",Yes
"Unfortunately, it won't let me give it a lower rating because it was a waste of time and memory. I suppose there are plenty of people who enjoy wasting their time by paying to move s*** around, but I'm not one of them.",Yes
"other reviews are accurate. You can't participate or play without spending thousands of dollars, thus it's a money grab. The game lacks an action component. The advertisements are accurate; it is addictive in a negative sense since you believe you are progressing in this scam but you aren't able to. They simply ask you for a hundred dollars every time you go on to perform endless research that becomes outdated after a week. Furthermore, if you get destroyed by stronger bases, you could quickly lose the money you just spent, which turns it into gambling rather than gaming.",Yes
"No stars, they were entertaining, but now they want people to spend $100 every day to stay up, and if they don't, they can't play. I can no longer play since there are too many new insignias and quick improvements. Nearly daily improvements. Therefore, everything you buy becomes outdated in 24 hours or less. Don't waste your time or money playing. NOT AT ALL FUN. MS made the game poorly because it was hungry. Only men who earn six figures a year can afford to participate in this game.",Yes
"This game is very pricey, and the developers update it so regularly that the things you just bought lose their usefulness. In order to compete effectively, be prepared to invest at least 500. Since this game is worthless and I can't even sell my account to recoup even a little portion of what I've paid, I wish I had never spent a penny on it.",Yes
"This game is unlike anything you've seen in the advertising or demos for other app games. The actual game has several bugs and frequently crashes out on you without warning. Pros: + Fun and addictive Quite complex strategy that has a higher learning curve Areas for development Glitchy, erratic app shutdowns; many advertising urging users to purchase packs; occasionally malfunctioning notifications If the game weren't so glitchy and there weren't so many advertisements urging you to buy things, I would give it more points. You must pay real money in order to advance, compete, or use all of the game's features; beware, it is quite addictive. I can't figure out how to accomplish anything in this game.",Yes
"The game doesn't run smoothly. Commander gear can be changed without freezing, however help desk tickets are never resolved. They don't and seem unable to resolve bugs.",Yes
"I'm only giving it one star because I'm unable to give it zero. Completely useless junk that is not worth the cost of being ""free.""",Yes
"It's not advisable to play mobile strike unless you want to spend a lot of money, and it occasionally doesn't work, in my experience after 4 months of playing. Find a different game.",Yes
"takes up your time and keeps asking you for money for improvements. Without consistently investing money into the game, you cannot succeed in this game. As a result, it became boring after a while. I don't think anyone should do this.",Yes
"Excellent game; highly entertaining and intricate; plenty to do. The only issue I have is that this game costs a lot of money to fully develop and reap its rewards. If it weren't for the cost increasing as you spend more, I would give it a perfect score of 5. Package prices begin at $9.99 and increase by $9.99 for each additional purchase. Even though I am aware that some games cost more, this is still unfair to the typical gamer.",Yes
"After receiving a ton of free content, I discovered the app was boring and utterly awful.",Yes
"For three hours, I was unable to access the game. then ads after reconnecting. NO GAME is available to play. ONLY AD.",Yes
"Time waster. endless duties to gradually build up resources, ammunition, manpower, etc. Not my cup of tea. 30 minutes later, I uninstalled it.",Yes
"I wasn't looking to buy this coin set. I like the 10,000 coin pack because you may save more money and receive a larger discount. However, it would only let me buy 2 of the smallest coin packs, so my savings were only.40. Even the time I spent initially trying to gain the savings was not worth it. The only reason I attempted buying these smaller packs was because one of your technical support representatives advised me to do so before trying the larger pack. It cut me off after I made the purchases for the lesser bundles. And I was unable to acquire anything else, much less the larger bundle I had been aiming for. Therefore, in the long run, I lost a lot of time and money by first buying the smaller packs of coins. Finally, I received payment for it. I appreciate that. However, I truly would have preferred for this problem to have been fixed before I made any further coin pack purchases.",Yes
"Playing is just too pricey. Prepare to spend hundreds per month if you want to compete. Greedy business... Over a few months, I spent many thousands of dollars, yet I still fell well short of becoming competitive. So... I gave my account to a friend after quitting. Unless you have hours to kill, the game is pretty dull. It takes a lot of pointless clicks and taps to improve XP, etc. Lots is what I mean. I'm talking about repeatedly tapping hundreds of times. While performing this boring activity, I frequently slept off. Therefore, I don't suggest anyone play this game, and if I were Arnold... Personally, I would leave the game without a smile. Game has potential, but the firm has been tainted by greed, and I don't think it will endure very long until they drastically modify the way they conduct business.",Yes
"The user interface is sluggish, crowded, and imprecise. The map is impossible to use. Although there is a limited capacity to contact with other players, the ""chat"" feature is connected to the gold shop. The ""blog"" is actually a series of blurbs about the most recent discount package. Despite posing as a ""war game,"" it contains no elements of strategy or tactics, which fall under the category of C3 (communication, command, and control). In addition, it is extremely expensive to play. To unlock important structures, technology, and combat abilities, 99.99 purchases are necessary. My recommendation is to not bother.",Yes
"Another aspect of the army that I can't handle. Additionally, it doesn't work well with the younger crowd",Yes
"Although it's a highly addictive game, I would never suggest playing it on any kind of Kindle. The game is quite sluggish, it stalls far too frequently, and there are frequently problems with gold purchases. My advice is to either find a better game or sell your Kindle.",Yes
"Although I didn't enjoy this game, things have changed. Regardless of the device or internet connection, the App constantly freezes or shuts down. The claim that this game is free to play is untrue. Due to the frequent introduction of new things that have the potential to completely outperform all currently available items, you have no chance of playing if you can't pay at least 200 every few days. The exorbitant prices have turned away thousands of customers.",Yes
"If you don't buy a fresh pack once or twice a week, you can't advance in the game. Pit of money. Not operating",Yes
"starving for cash developers. Fuck all of them. At least once a week, new modifications. Unless you're a billionaire, this game is useless; even then, why would you waste your time playing it?",Yes
Another aspect of the army that I can't handle. Works incredibly well with younger audiences,Yes
"If you don't buy a fresh pack once or twice a week, you can't advance in the game. Pit of money.",Yes
"starving for cash developers. At least once a week, new modifications. Unless you're a billionaire, this game is useless; even then, why would you waste your time playing it?",Yes
"Customer service just offers canned, pre-written responses that DO NOT address your issue or flaws in how the game is run. The typical response asks you to do a hard reset and restart the game in order to resume activities. The game will therefore pause in the middle of a war game while you are vulnerable and assaulting, and you will be required to complete a technical task on your phone that takes at least five minutes. As a result, you have been reduced to being a target for an aggressor, and you have simply wasted your money. Additionally, numerous system resets are needed for corrections and modifications as well as the ongoing marketing upgrades introduced into game play. Some of these resets happen in the middle of the game, requiring you to log back in. During this time, you run the danger of losing the money you just spent.",Yes
"Nothing like the commercials, just another waste of time and space that steals money",Yes
"This game is terrible; it takes forever to load, and when it does, it lags so much that you can't play.",Yes
"This is both pricey and tediously long. Additionally, this game isn't functioning properly, I found it to be boring, and I don't have that much time to set up a game.",Yes
I truly hope that they make some modifications because the game is becoming increasingly pricey and many high spenders have really stopped playing.,Yes
"It costs thousands of dollars to keep up, thus you can't possibly keep up. Many players spend $100 to $200 on the game before giving their accounts away, and even then, if you get one of these accounts, the game is not enjoyable.",Yes
"However, the marketing machine is moving at rapid speed. You won't be able to stay up or compete unless you continue to spend astronomical sums of money. Major time waster as well. Spend your time on something more worthwhile.",Yes
"It wasn't even worth downloading; after spending time putting it up, it was erased. Additionally, the software doesn't work properly when you launch it.",Yes
"Although it has a lot of potential and can't possibly be enjoyable, this game is somewhat of a bait and switch. The first game bundle costs only $4.99, the second is $19.99, which is still not outrageous, but the last one costs a staggering $99.99. It's obviously not worth it unless you're independently wealthy, given how glitchy the program is and how it constantly occurs at the worst possible time. Without spending a lot of money, it is just impossible to compete successfully. Although there have been apparent attempts to make the game UI as intuitive as possible, it still has a very long way to go. Game rules and explanations are at best simplistic. The combination of all of this causes a great deal of uncertainty for novice gamers. Customer service has typically been prompt, but just about half the time has it been beneficial or useful. It seems entirely random as to whether you speak with a support representative who has a thorough understanding of the game. Overall, this game has to perform much, much better for the outrageous amounts being charged. It's a shame because it does contain some intriguing concepts. It's an absolute disgrace that they don't just reduce their pricing and try to make up the difference by doing more business. Far fewer gamers would undoubtedly feel as though they were taken advantage of. I simply don't enjoy this game.",Yes
"very dull dumb game, pretty boring dumb game, and not working",Yes
I simply detest this game. I wasn't all that excited about that app because it was boring and I didn't use it for more than a few days.,Yes
"Overzealous update frequency The next week, there will be another 20 dollars to catch up once more after you buy one 20 dollar pack to be caught up. Overall, paid players spend too much money to stay up in a single month. There are better games to waste your free time on if you're a casual player.",Yes
What a waste of time it is that everything costs money.,Yes
"For a while, the game was enjoyable. Now it frequently crashes. Sometimes it crashes right away, and other times it runs for five or ten minutes before giving out. Support is useless. They claim that my device (a Note 5) is the problem after trying all they advised without fixing it and that they are unable to assist. On various devices, my son and my neighbors all play, and they all have frequent crashes. They don't appear to be able to stabilize their game, and I can't keep playing this way.",Yes
"was unable to download it successfully. I don't know what the issue is because I had plenty space for it, but whatever.",Yes
doesn't make sense at all. How should I operate the controls? seriously stupid Time waster.,Yes
"To difficult to set up. I had hoped it would be more intuitive, but it seems to be a time waster.",Yes
"I would have given it a five because I have so far thoroughly enjoyed the game, but today it locked me out and won't let me log back in. So tonight I shall undo all my progress. Therefore, as of right now, I am VERY dissatisfied with Epic War and Mobile Strike's capacity to assist me in resolving a problem. If someone could only assist me in fixing my account, I would be happy to update my review.",Yes
"There are no safeguards in place to guarantee your success. Bullies with a lot of money can use the game to thoroughly discredit everyone else. The creators don't care about producing a high-quality product; they are more interested in taking advantage of trusting consumers. I tried contacting them, but they either ignored me or said they ""can't repair it,"" which is false. I explained how they are simply unwilling to invest the time because addressing problems would result in less people purchasing their advertisements.

"pricey and addictive This game is not for you if you do not intend to invest a lot of money in order to achieve. I continue to play because of the relationships I formed inside my alliance. However, kill events are few and my current status is essentially dead. Previously, you could obtain a number of commanders each day, but nowadays, you must rally a person at least 20 times in order to accomplish this. Since months ago, I have not solo hit anyone. To keep this game going, A STATE MERGER IS A MUST. The game's servers are continually having problems, and given how much money we all pay for it, I don't see why they keep happening. However, customer support is quite accommodating and generally kind when it comes to resolving problems and bugs within the game. I'm really sorry.",Yes
I find timed performance-based competition in video games to be boring.,Yes
"After installation, when I tried to play, I was constantly presented with products for sale. Following one another. Never succeeded in playing the game or even attempting it. No demo is offered, not even a playable demo. Downloading this was a complete waste of time.",Yes
"Don't waste your time unless you're prepared to spend $1,000 per month to even be able to compete.",Yes
"accidentally downloaded and removed. I haven't even tried it, so I can't comment.",Yes
"As each pack cost $99 and they continue to introduce more, better stuff every week, I have spent over $900. You require billions of resources and files for research and upgrades, which means you have to keep paying money to get a 10-minute excitement. With that much cash, I was only able to get up to $300,000. Up to 32 million of our biggest spenders purchase packs weekly. They alter the game so drastically that it is hard to keep up without investing more and more cash. and you lose your entire army in one attach. We have 30 days of 45K gold shielding. You are unable to even sell your account since, after a few weeks, it will be worthless. If you receive a Billion Resources this week in 99, you can receive a $50 note the next week, but even that won't be sufficient for the next level. There isn't enough value in the game. (State 37:137:517) No matter what, if you don't work for them, you'll never succeed.",Yes
Absolute garbage if you're looking for a game to waste your money on.,Yes
"unclear design, boring gameplay, and excessive product promotion",Yes
"I subscribe on a regular basis to get rid of the ads. For a while, it worked, however as of late, my iPhone's mirroring attempts result in a blank screen. What's the problem? There is no way to reach customer service. Please get in touch with me about this, thanks. -9/19: Still waiting for a response; the problem persists. Continuing charges",Yes
"The ""Free"" edition was completely useless. received a message stating that the advertising would not play; buy the paid version. So I bought for the version, which included a two-week ""free trial"" before switching automatically to the full, 12.95/year version. It appears to have been bought on Amazon Digital Subscriptions, but it is still not functional. The same problem is displayed while trying to play advertising, buy the paid version, or activate adverts. There is no mechanism to ""allow ads,"" and I already paid for the premium edition. Doesn't function as a free version or a paid version. Avoid wasting time. I simply hope that the app didn't steal my logins for HBO Max, Amazon, and other services. I don't have any xenophobic feelings, but the fact that the developer's name is solely written in Chinese characters worries me because the PRC government is dictatorial and well-known for supporting hackers around the world.",Yes
"I was able to cast the screen of my Samsung S8 phone running Firefox to my LG TV using an Amazon FireStick. I discovered that I also needed to install the Google Home app on my phone, launch it, and select the Cast connection in the Firestick app. It functions, but I'm not sure how much I can rely on the Chinese-developed program to keep my data secure and free from eavesdropping (Chongqing Ioni Technology Co., Ltd.) Numerous skips in the Vimeo video the last time I used it; perhaps sluggish internet; or was there another issue? but I'm scared of it.",Yes
"It repeatedly logs out of the software. My WiFi is compatible with all other devices and apps, so I know the problem isn't with the connection.",Yes
"No, a second window appeared midway through the movie and I was unable to close it; as a result, I was unable to see the film's conclusion.",Yes
"This works to make it possible for me to mirror the screen from my iPhone or iPad onto a Fire TV stick. It's far less user-friendly than my Samsung smart TV or Apple TV, which both have the feature built in, but it works if you just want to rapidly share a screen with a few more keys to push. It doesn't merely function the same as Apple systems. But I can't complain because it's free.",Yes

"I used it for Oculus Quest casting. first worked fine but ceased operating after a few months. Even after downloading the Pro version's trial, it still isn't functional. On Oculus Quest, I receive an error notice that reads ""casting/livestreaming error."" Someone mentioned that the trial doesn't work but that if you pay it does.",Yes

"This router is awful, not easy, and does the job. I would have liked to see some parentalsecurity profiles with more complex features, but you get what you pay for. Since I've been using it for about a month, I haven't had any issues. The Tether app's main drawback is that occasionally it won't let you log in using your phone; instead, you'll need to restart the router to get access. Otherwise, using a laptop to log in is seamless.",Yes
"Avoid downloading It isn't even close to being Snapchat; all it does is promote your Snapchat username so that random perverts can add you and send crude pictures. I closed the app and logged out, but the issue persisted. Can anyone offer any assistance?",Yes
"Unable to or unwilling to invest real money, you advance in this extremely stressful game very slowly. If you are specifically seeking something, you must do quest after quest in order to obtain it; but, all you receive is energy or something you already have in abundance. In this case, you should carefully consider deleting the game. Support is useless since they only give you pointless emails.",Yes
"Showed promise as a game that would be interesting, however after playing a few rounds, the game became continuously stuck at one point. unable to go past it. Removing it.",Yes
"I was happy to discover that there was a Kindle edition of this because my sister-in-law has it on her iPad. The only drawbacks I've encountered are that the game can occasionally lock up and that the hints flash on the screen too quickly for easy reading. For more seasoned players, this may be an issue.",Yes
"1. The game has frozen, making it unable to save all of your progress.",Yes
Can't get far without assistance that is WAY too expensive; who spends $40 or more for a few extra aids?,Yes
"As soon as the app charged me for stuff I didn't receive, I stopped like it. What a scam",Yes
"When I try to click on buttons to play the game, I run into issues. It is annoying to constantly press a button in order to get to a playing area or instructions on what to do next.",Yes
"One of the worst examples of this game type I've ever played, in my opinion. Slow, boring, and repetitive game, plot, and aesthetics. Run, don't walk away from this game unless you're prepared to continue playing it till retirement. A waste of time. boring, did I mention that? You have been forewarned.",Yes
"I might be missing the purpose, but other critics seem to be. An understatement would be ""PAY TO PLAY."" Literally, I've learned that in order to gain any amazing troops, like DELTA FORCE or Mercenaries, or anything that can successfully defend your base or attack other bases, you kind of need to reach past level 21. Guess what, even with that opulent starting package I paid 4.99 and then 19.99 for, you still need special items, like Magic Hammers, and other things to improve the base's buildings in order to reach level 21. And I don't Like Brilliantly because it costs only $99.99 and the level 20 cutoff is where boys turn into men. I absolutely miss the days when you could buy a PC game for as little as $99.99, own it, and play it for years without having to spend any additional money. They definitely grabbed my every nickel because MOBILE STRIKE IS A MONEY PIT, a hole in the ground for your hard-earned money (actual money). I only hope that other people don't waste their time constructing bases just to discover that they WILL be destroyed, overrun, or even have your commander killed by someone who was stupid enough to pay 99.9 or more to trample over those of us who refused to do so. Just a thought...",Yes
"A horrible excuse for a game, Mobile Strike. Epic has unmistakably created a platform that has made it possible for a traditional con to stoke greed. I find the game to be quite annoying, and I don't enjoy it. I enjoyed playing this game for a few months back when it originally came out. I had just finished level 21 when I initially quit, and level 22 was released a short while later. To keep your forces at a level where they can be productive, there is a constant need to spend money. Typically, packets cost 99. I returned after a year, and level 60s were present. For 4.99, epic offers a catch up pack. Not bad, I believed. To get me to level 90, the subsequent bundle cost $19.00. They will start selling level 125s in three weeks. The amount of data utilized to track resources is staggering. such sums as Million, Trillion, Trillion, and Trillion (MTTT). Epic updates the game frequently, making it more and more necessary to buy new packs in order to advance to the next level. The most recent power levels are multiplied by 10 whenever a level is extended. By doing so, a person with a lesser power level has no chance of defeating a 10 times stronger foe. As a result, the 4.99 catch-up deal quickly changed to 99 packs to maintain. To be competitive in the current game, you need to take two power steps per week. I would strongly advise against playing this fictitious game.",Yes
Real time clocks were awful. Nobody wants to have to wait an hour for an upgrade. This game is a waste of time if you build all these forces to attack a base and all you see is a tank shooting.,Yes
"The game's performance is poor, and they keep adding new stuff while leaving the issues unattended. This game is perfect for those who dislike spending money.",Yes
"Don't buy this game; it has a lot of problems. My iTunes account has duplicated and overcharged me, and the products in my pack don't contain what they claim to. The very following day, I bought a pack that was outdated and contained lower tier height troops. Not worthwhile.",Yes
"This game is a knockoff, as others have stated. If you want to keep up, you have to spend a lot of money. A least of $1,000 each month, in my opinion. They regularly produce new products that render the things you previously purchased obsolete. It is also quite addictive, so if you struggle with addiction, be careful. The designers don't care about the typical player; they just cater to big spenders. If you are unable to spend a lot of money, those who can constantly kick your but. The rich picking on the poor is a well-known practice. It is dominated by bullies with unlimited resources. The developers don't care about making the game fair or even competitive; they only worry about how much money they can make in the shortest amount of time. Currently, everyone in my alliance has either departed the game and established a another, significantly less expensive one, or is on strike (not spending any money). In this manner, we may all continue to play together without spending money we cannot afford. I would advise not playing this game.",Yes
"Horrible gameplay; I'm playing it on my Kindle Fire and it keeps crashing, making it impossible for me to do anything. This is, in my opinion, a MAJOR PROBLEM and needs to be fixed.",Yes
Another pointless game. I would these developers would use their abilities and time for something more beneficial. There are many social issues that need to be resolved.,Yes
"Normally, I wouldn't give a game a 1 star rating, but this one does. Due to the extreme lag, playing is all but impossible. The load times are awful. After you tap a command, it takes anything between 3 and 25 seconds for the dialogue to load. I reasoned that I should go through the lesson as the issue might have only affected the pregame. Not at all. The main game is also plagued by lag and load times. Let's hope the creators release a patch or update with a fix. I won't worry with it until then.",Yes
"If I could, I would give this game a bad rating of two stars, but you can only give it one. Having said that, I choose not to give the game a negative rating because it is entertaining for about 30 minutes before forcing you to purchase really expensive packs in order to advance. Don't waste your money, and if you must get rid of it, donate it to a good cause.",Yes
"The in-game advertisements are incredibly misleading, in-game purchases are frequently not delivered, and customer service is unwilling to address any problems.",Yes
"It costs several hundreds of dollars to create an account that can really be used to play. Once there, the game updates so quickly that you are no longer relevant and unable to play within a week, and you have to spend more money to improve once more. It is an endless circle. I strongly advise staying away from this game.",Yes
"The game's gameplay isn't given enough consideration by the developers, who merely want to extort as much cash as possible from the users. They want to release something new virtually every day despite the fact that they haven't fixed the gold store, released war bonds but haven't yet finished setting up the ability to utilize them, and many other problems. To stay in the game will cost you thousands of dollars. For releasing a product that is at best subpar, I would terminate all the managers and developers if I were the CEO. Stop releasing content so frequently and fix your game so that it doesn't appear as like you're attempting to kill it.",Yes
"Start not playing this game or any other game created by this studio. Device Zone Although it's free to sign up for the games, you CANNOT actually play without spending moneyóin the $1,000 level and aboveóand the want to keep spending money never goes away. For that price, the game doesn't even function properly, and they clearly have no interest in repairing it. Spend your money somewhere else and spare yourself the frustration. I adore the individuals I've met through gaming, but heed my counsel. Play Farmville and locate a free chat room. Arnold Schwarzenegger ought to feel guilty about his involvement in it.",Yes
"Yes, you must pay money to acquire the items necessary for game advancement. Due to EW's design, the game is far too complicated. The marketing division has complete authority over EW. The various performance issues are never resolved. The game stops up after my most recent in-app purchase, rendering it completely unplayable. To my email, four different ""representatives"" had responded. Not yet fixed.",Yes
"Ever since it originally came out, I have played this game. The reviews contain accurate information. terrible bugs, awful customer service. Only the wealthy can play this game because it is a massive money pit (have I mentioned the Middle Eastern and Japanese/Korean money-spending elites?) Don't bother if you can't afford to spend at least $500 every month on this game. The private owners must be purchasing houses and yachts on a weekly basis since Epic War, as MZ, has so effectively manipulated this game. Spend less, my friends.",Yes
"What a waste of time and money. The game lures you in with inexpensive upgrade packs at first. However, when you try to stay up with the high-powered players who are prowling unshielded bases, it quickly becomes necessary to buy packs costing $100 and higher. Without spending thousands of dollarsóno, I'm not exaggeratingóyou can never hope to have enough power to compete. 1000s) of money. Parents, warn your children away from this con since they will waste all of their money on it.",Yes
"When a game is this jerky, you are powerless to do anything. Btw. The advertisements annoy me.",Yes
"Most awful game ever. You literally spend a lot of money tapping your screen thousands of times in an effort to establish a solid foundation. They then fail to give you the files and supplies you require, draining you further. THEN they release new material on a weekly basis to keep you splurging and pressing buttons. Oh, and disregard customer support. Worst ever, nothing is fixed, nothing is given, and you are just told to wait. Just wait, but don't stop your buying. I know folks who built their bases for almost 10,000 dollars and are still unable to compete. Now, even killing enemies is impossible. Simply hurt them. I am a level 40, 4MT power base, and I am unable to kill a level 9 rebel because I lack mobile ops. Every day, I send tickets, but to no avail. It is a total waste of time and resources. I wish I had never started. I tried setting the commander skill tree for a set of gear for two hours last night, but the game booted me just as I reached about 2500 of the roughly 3000 points set. I tried four times before giving up. Oh, and you want to attack? You will be expelled at least three times. It's a terrible way to waste life. I'm tired of having to touch on my iPhone countless times per day only to establish a foundation that is useless.",Yes
"massive money grab Everyone is tapping and waiting. You can't compete with fools that spend over $100 just to seem powerful, thus it's boring. Spend 25 and a month clicking the screen to reach the point where you can't advance without spending at least another $50. I was an idiot for falling for the scam.",Yes
"This game lures you in by offering it for free. If you really want to play it, you must be prepared to spend money on packs in order to level up and acquire better equipment. But every few weeks, a better set of equipment replaces that one, rendering it outdated. Purchasing the packs is insufficient. It takes a lot of busywork to create, improve, obstruct, etc. You must establish a base with at least 50 trillion power before you can engage in full combat. This will cost between $50 and $100 every day. True, every day. In a few weeks, there will be more. Although the majority of people would not pay this much money, some can and some MS employees also play the game for free. They can kill you in one blow since they are so strong. One strike can erase all of your hard work; it takes days to rebuild. The majority of people won't enjoy this game.",Yes
"Boring. No actual plan, and you don't feel like you're fighting. You simply wait, then spend money to make the time pass more quickly, but you still have to wait.",Yes
"Greedy developers, a paid game, frequent bugs, and daily updates. Completely avoid I played up to the launch earlier this year; it was a complete waste of time and money.",Yes
"Unbelievably high costs involved in playing the game, keeping up, and avoiding total ruin. Every few days, a new pack is issued, and you must keep up with it to keep from losing all of your obscenely costly troops.",Yes
"Simply put, playing this game is a waste of time and money. You might enjoy this game if you want to watch numbers grow, but don't expect to be able to compete without paying hundreds or thousands of dollars.",Yes
Ripoff. Avoid playing this game. Can't believe a class action lawsuit hasn't been filed yet against this developer.,Yes
"Time and money wasted. Spend days constructing your fort, just to have a maxed out or hacker player port right up to your defenses and completely destroy you. Goodbye to the money used for upgrades",Yes
"Time and money wasted If you enjoy giving money to others, feel free to send it to me using my paypal.",Yes
"awful development Don't bother unless you can afford to spend hundreds to thousands of dollars every month on in-game items. Every few days to a few weeks, they release a new pack, and only the 99.99 packs are even worth purchasing because the rest won't even keep you in the game's competitive bracket. Another issue is the game's glitchiness, slowness, and severe problems caused by the intense load on it. I've had a number of issues with the game. I've already spent close to 700 on in-app purchases, and the programmers claim that the only way to remedy the problem is to give you a few benefits that don't even come close to making up for what their sluggish servers and app crashes cost you. Even worse, despite being aware of the problem, they kept quiet about the fact that some of the things in their premium packs didn't appear in your in-game inventory after you purchased them. When I contacted the customer care personnel about missing things, they even confirmed this in an email exchange with me. Fuck all, fuck fck all",Yes
"Everything in this game is exactly the same as it is in Game of War. All they did was alter the theme. So it's just a TRAP to earn money, exactly as GoW. It requires very little skill and tons of money, but the images are horrible (they're nothing like the ads). It's also really aggravating when you first begin a game and individuals with armies that are a thousand times stronger than yours repeatedly burn and murder your bases as a clever method to get you to PAY so you could defend yourself and attempt to advance. Everything is essentially geared toward selling you gold. Every time you launch the game or even view a notice, an advertisement to purchase gold pops up repeatedly. It is obscenely obnoxious. feels like a pop-up ad-filled porn website. Then, things get interesting when you choose to purchase a pack. Your initial purchase is $5, followed by a second one of $25, then a hundred and more. And they are identical. As a result, the same pack that cost you 5 earlier in the game will now cost you 150. Therefore, they are essentially boosting the price for repeat clients. Simply said, you don't start using strategy until you reach level 21 or higher. Up until that point, it simply comes down to who loses patience and who has the money to travel to HQ21. After that, you can engage in combat with your alliance and begin planning. If you spend less than $100, it takes you easily 45 to 60 days to get there, and even if you spend more, it takes around a month. Overall, if not for all the intrusive commercials, the pricey gold packs, and the lack of a better framework to aid smaller players, the game could have been fantastic. As with the false advertising they created, graphics should also be improved. In general, neither you nor your children should play this game. Do not waste your money unless you are willing to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars. Online account purchases are significantly more affordable than account creation from scratch.",Yes
"Before January 2017, this game was entertaining and reasonably priced. It is now merely a cash cow. I have spent $13,450.00 in total, which puts me far behind the competition. They now add new items every three to four days, and without them you are unable to compete. All of this is already unacceptable, but now they have started outright stealing money from players. I purchased a $100.00 pack, and five minutes later, another $100.00 was charged. They claim they don't have a record of the purchase and won't give me the pack I paid for or my money back. Thirty of the folks I know have experienced the same thing. So I made the decision to play exclusively with gift cards, but I soon discovered a new scam where they accept your money but fail to deliver the pack. Although they claim they are, the things are not in my account. I've supplied six screenshots demonstrating this, yet they continue to claim it's there despite my evidence. Things got worse last night when I started getting attacked and the game threw me out. I attempted repeatedly to log back in but kept getting a server busy error. To log back in, I had to remove first and then reinstall. When I did, I discovered that the game had changed my armor, making me weaker, and that more than half of my millions of troops were gone. Do not let this game deceive you; it is currently terrible and not worth playing.",Yes
I tried for about a month to enjoy this game. Unsuccessful...a hugely tedious waste of time.,Yes
"Constantly crashes, loads slowly, and is an awful waste in general.",Yes
"It's all just a money grab. Free to begin, but pricey to continue. Due to frequent money-grabbing updates that can cost a grand or more to max out, even the greatest players spend thousands of dollars a month and still quit. Also, the developers are unable to respond to inquiries. When asked a question like why is my game different on my phone and tablet, they send someone to respond on their behalf before choosing to remain silent. They only care about money. Keep yours and skip this game.",Yes
Can't advance regulations are put in place so that you can be assaulted without having to protect yourself or respond with worthless crap.,Yes
"If you want to have fun with this game, it will literally cost you thousands of dollars. upgrades every week with features that cost hundreds of dollars. Too many people are giving up since they can't keep up with the big spenders after spending hundreds of dollars or more. You will die and have all of your resources taken, so you can't enjoy the features of the game. Put your money to other uses.",Yes
Money sucking piece of crap game 100 a week if you want to compete\sI love playing on my phone but on my kindle it shuts down loses connection and is just total crap... If you are trying to play on kindle don't waste your time,Yes
"Don't download this; I did and I erased it. You can't see because there are ads all over the screen. Nothing sends, and deleting it, like I did, causes your Kindle to freeze. In truth, it has happened before and I was unable to alter my background. One of the worst games I've ever downloaded is this one. AVOID BUYING THIS PIECE OF CRAP",Yes
"I spent at least 500 playing this game for far over a year and a half. Other gamers have already spent enough cash to purchase a new vehicle or house. You guys constantly making it harder to make any kind of progress in this game. You folks made me detest it, so I had to delete it. It's unfair when individuals spend 90% of their time playing this game and have nothing to show for it because I felt like I worked really hard to get my base where it was and I couldn't afford to spend money like most people can. It's impossible to have fun because of you guys.",Yes
"Mobile Strike never has bugs, but my Kindle Fire does. It simply takes a brief pause. I have to tap it repeatedly to get it moving because it is likewise quite slow. I wish I could, but I can't suggest this game to anyone.",Yes
"Play now for free in the App Store with ""Mobile Strike"" for nothing? I need a break. There is so much garbage being pushed down your throat and shoved in your mouth that it isn't even amusing. The worst thing is that the screen is completely blocked by these advertisements, which are running nonstop 24 hours a day. And Arnold Schwarzenegger, come on! real creative dudes Get away from this game. It lags a lot and is similar to all the other building games. NEVER squander your time.",Yes
"This game has awful issues, yet the developers won't fix them. They sell incomplete packages in order to take your money.",Yes
"This game is terrible. may not function quickly and well on older iOS and Android devices. On my iPhone 4S, the state map crashes every time I access it. The game's strategic depth is lacking despite how simple it is. You are essentially told what to upgrade. However, if you are not a part of one of the state's key coalitions, you will perish. Every time I reach a particular power level since I began playing, the ruling alliance has demolished my base and confiscated all of my resources. If you wanted to invest a lot of money, you could become competitive, but the strong coalitions would still amass a sizable army and defeat you. I spent a lot of money to finally get close to my alliance, but the first day they just kept pounding bases, and I was absolutely devastated. Your power will probably never increase if you can't play continuously.",Yes
"I've played Mobile Strike on both a Kindle and a Google device. It can be a fun way to kill time if the application is reliable, but the Kindle Fire version needs a lot of work. It is obvious that the game's creators put more effort on draining your wallet of your hard-earned money than they did in building a solid foundation. If you've never heard of MS, it has a design similar to Game of War. Before using resources to build your foundation, they must be built in the proper order. Construction requires a lot of time and resources. If you want to play this game for a while, it's helpful to read some of the internet guides. Your bases will soon be destroyed, your supplies will be exhausted, and those ruthless, kill-at-all-costs players will execute your commander. These players seem to have an unlimited supply of resources and control the majority of the game's areas. A player can easily amass tens of thousands of dollars with bonus boxes that include speedups, boosts, additional resources, power choices, and other potent commodities sold at a ""HUGE DISCOUNT."" Since you have to buy ""commendations"" to move on in the game, your commander will eventually become locked at a specific level. This is among the worst pay-to-play games I've seen recently. Arnold's support for a game that takes advantage of its players in this egregiously inept combat game, where the only way to win is to be the one who pays the most, astounds me but doesn't surprise me.",Yes
"Instead of receiving an automated email answer from the marketing team for this game, which will steal your money and your phone and deceive you about game packages, there is no customer service phone number to contact. They may sell you packs that are generally 100 but are only 20 when you purchase them, or they may only give you the older packs rather than the new ones. Their relentlessly aired adverts, which highlight new things they're trying to convince you to buy, are absurd. Spend a few dollars every other day to play, and when all you want to do is go on to the next screen, it will try to trick you into purchasing a package. ap bought and paid for. and won't work on my Kindle Fire HD 10.

On my Kindle Fire, the product I downloaded doesn't work. I made an effort to contact the vendor, but guess what? It's no longer real. It gets worse since despite my efforts, Amazon's automated system will not let me ask for a refund.

Letters disappear when typing quickly because the software is unable to keep up. Annotations are painful to remove. numerous other usability problems. Professional usability testing is what I advise.

"As soon as I start the apps in the S3 tab, they crash and I can't even open a single file.",Yes

And sincerely, you're going to mess with the wrong person one day and, hopefully, face legal action for your ripoffs. And I'm almost done with Amazon, so I can't wait until I get a phone. I'm unable to download even a basic app for my academic work. If it's that difficult to create real apps or are you simply too lazy to actually make things so simple, I'm getting the grade instead of you. I'm not the only one who is sick and tired of it, and this is coming from an 11-year-old who finds it sad that it has to be that way. I'm sure every person who downloaded it wants to throw their Amazon tablet, phone, or whatever out the window, and if you don't read these, get ready for a lot of freaking phone calls.",Yes
"This application is not SnapChat, nor does it give you any access to SnapChat. A complete waste of time. Thank you for nothing at all; I will never use this app. Give us the genuine Snapchat right away.",Yes
This app is garbage. You must have a SnapChat account to use it. Don't waste your time getting it because it will simply be simpler to obtain the regular one if you thought you would only be able to communicate with people.,Yes
"Nothing can be done because this is so terrible. THE REAL SNAPCHAT, PLEASE AMAZON Because Snapchat is available on other devices, this situation is unfair, and Amazon should simply provide it. Since I don't own a phone and all of my friends use Snapchat, I am unable to keep up with this idiotic imitation. Just give us regular Snapchat, Amazon. As well as updating social media apps, as I receive updates about a year after they are released. Publish faster updates.",Yes
"People are so stupid, it's disturbing. You can't even remove your username from it, but requests keep coming in. I want my name to be removed. I would have removed it myself, but you made it so that we can't. How do you plan to have content customers?",Yes
"I had to download Mobogenie to get my snap, but it still doesn't work because I need Google Play services. What is wrong with Kindle that you can't do anything on here? Give us what we wantóthe real Snapchatóand until you do, I won't pay for anything on Amazon because this is so pitiful and so lazy.",Yes
Finding people to pick seems like a huge waste of time in my opinion.,Yes
This app is terrible; why can't Amazon at least provide the authentic Snapchat rather than fake versions that don't function? I couldn't even log in.,Yes
"I swear I'd rather spend my entire birthday budget on a phone so I can use SnapChat, download this, throw it out the window, and scream ""F U, Amazon!"" IT'S A WASTE is inoperative: ( I'm so hurt and disappointed. Why must you provide us with a subpar off-brand version, Amazon? We seek the actual thing.",Yes
"Without the real Snapchat, this app is completely useless. It's time for the app store offered to Kindle users to keep up with the times and offer apps like SnapChat, Instagram, and other popular ones rather than outdated obscure ones that receive fewer than five downloads annually. I am becoming increasingly irritated and angry as a kindle user with the garbage that is being provided to me in place of the actual apps. Please stop denying us what our devoted users truly want and stop distributing utter BULLLL like this app. I'm grateful.",Yes
"Come on, we knew they had nothing, but now that it doesn't work, why can't we just do something enjoyable? A few of us maintain social lives.",Yes
"Nobody would download this app because it doesn't work, so I'll just keep using my iPhone 5, which is much, much better. Amazon FAILS.",Yes
Why are there outdated apps on this tablet instead of the real ones? This app is terrible; do not purchase it.,Yes
"Why can't Amazon just give us Snapchat instead of these stupid, ineffective knockoffs? It's terrible, and I'm really getting tired of them. The same is true for Instagram. All of us are growing weary of this Amazon. I wish I could give it a zero rating; fix it. I'm not sure what they had in mind when they created the app, but it was a failure. There is no benefit, in my opinion. I'm sick and tired of Amazon's jokes. PURCHASE THE REAL SNAPCHAT",Yes
You are unable to access your Snap Chat account because this does not work at all.,Yes
"No app opened, blank screen, time waster",Yes
"Because you can't even chat, it is useless. Snap Chat is incorrect, as it was stated, but students in my class have it.",Yes
"Since I don't yet have a phone, this stupidity doesn't work, so my mother downloaded it, but it reports that the text was not sent. UGHH.",Yes
"Junk. because it uses Google's infrastructure and wants unrestricted access to my gmail and Google accounts, I don't need the app.",Yes

"On my iPad, I was unable to get it to operate. I had to delete it",Yes
"When I was almost done with level 36 last night, the game crashed, and I was unable to continue.",Yes
"As soon as I received the game, I deleted it. My time was wasted on that.",Yes
Life and money wasted.,Yes
No physical altercation Unable to comprehend all the upgrades,Yes
"I initially thought it would be enjoyable, but the second time I tried it, I was unable to play Boring. Nothing sets it apart from similar products in the category.",Yes
"My issue is that the system informed me there was a problem with my transaction and that I would receive an email shortly. The email did follow, but all it said was that I had made a purchase. Well, I never got the things, despite trying multiple times on different occasions after seeing the error message and assuming it would be a WIFY issue. My card had exceeded its limitations when I eventually received the credit card statement. Therefore, use extreme caution when playing these games since they will continue to charge you even if you do not receive your things. Keep track of all of your purchases, especially the ones when you realize there is an issue.",Yes
Waist of cash read about half and ignored the rest because it was all nonsense and not very credible. Actoun Avoid wasting time.,Yes
"Server crashes frequently; if you can't afford $100 each week, don't even bother; just be zeroed and have no enjoyment at all.",Yes
"This ""game"" is a discouraging time waster. I believe it is appropriate to present this review after three months of relentless grinding. I've read numerous reviews from other players, so I'm aware that my experience isn't exceptional but rather quite typical. The players who cheat the most and spend the most money control each state. Spending more money than the other players or hacking the game to obtain items that would otherwise cost money are the only ways to win. The ultimate goal of the game is for each state to cooperate in order to defeat other states in point competitions. By completely destroying their base, the petty power bullies, on the other hand, refuse to give any smaller players the chance to fully participate in the challenges. I regret downloading it. I'm glad I avoided spending money on it. Oh, right Like the Mafia, the major players try to bully and threaten smaller players into paying for their protection. Customer service even supports this behavior.",Yes
"time waster with a lot of ads that offers no entertainment. It's worse than Clash of Clans, which I only kind of enjoyed.",Yes
"The slow feedback in this game is the problem I have with it. I recently complained about not getting in-game purchases fulfilled. Still no response after two days. We'll see how it turns out. Many players have voiced complaints about how long it takes to complete in-game purchases made with Amazon Coin. Therefore, avoid using Amazon Coin to make purchases if you need it right away. You'll be in the clear if you don't mind waiting a few daysóno pun intended.",Yes
"The game can be extremely boring at times, and the only way to have any fun is to own an oil plant because everything is so expensive. Ugh, where do I even begin. And, get this, I went on vacation for a few months, and when I returned, I received a gift that could have taken me years to earn in addition to a welcome back gift. Writing your first sentence is harder than this game; it's too simple. In this game, you receive notifications left and right. Additionally, it occupies far too much space. This game is ideal for those who want to play a dull and terrible game.",Yes
"I have a modest amount of money invested, but developers keep dumping content on us, negating the value of our investments. I stopped spending after a year and a half and protected my account.",Yes
"merely because I can't give it a star rating of zero. If you like to compete by spending hundreds of dollars and hours clicking buttons, only to lose to someone who has more money? And since this game is still terrible, you should find a new hobby. I quit.",Yes
"If you don't want to lose thousands of dollars, stay away from the game. No support money-hungry jerks.",Yes
"This game is awful. Unless you want to waste your time, avoid purchasing it. I wouldn't understand it.",Yes
"There is no live support, huge financial waste, log-in issues, and a need to email support after the base has already been destroyed.",Yes
"This ""game"" is essentially robbery. DO NOT purchase this game unless you have an endless supply of cash. In essence, it is riddled with bugs, frequently crashes, and you can never advance in the game to actually compete unless you have $100 to spare every few days. Unquestionably NOT FREE The game's developers insist that you pay to play, but they never fix any problems, and they are certainly unhelpful when you contact them. I feel guilty. I would like my hard-earned money back after having spent it.",Yes
"You can only advance in this fame to a certain point before having to spend actual money. They advertise gear for the strongest, but you can only get it by purchasing ""packs,"" which is equivalent to paying with gold, but the money has no value. You only buy the pack for the gear so you can compete with other bases without getting smashed, because you KNOW they've purchase the latest gear. So you drop 100 thinking it'll be worth it. Then 2 days later they release new ""all powerful"" gear, rendering your gear outdated, and you can't buy the newest gear without spending another 100 They pitch the gear as being worth a specific price, then they depreciate it days later without giving you a refund because they want to sell you the REAL strong gear.... It's a racket. They are thieves and liars.",Yes
"If you can afford spending 100 per day, than this is the game for you. Glitches, terrible performance, horrible customer service, and a lot I can't recall right now. Used to be a nice game, but the greed of the game developers ruined it. Pretending to be a free to play game is not cool. Don't download it.",Yes
"I may be missing the point, but I'm reading it from other reviewers ""PAY TO PLAY"" is an understatement. Literally, I've found out that you kind of need to get over level 21 to receive any amazing units like DELTA FORCE or Mercenaries, or anything that can defend your base or attack other bases well. Well, guess what, even with that high beginning package I paid for 4.99 and then 19.99, to reach to level 21, you need special things like Magic Hammers, and what not, to improve the buildings in the base. And BRILLIANTLY, that cutoff at level 20 is where boys become men, and all for the modest price of 99.99. I really do miss the old days of PC games where you literally might spend 99.99 but you own it, you play it for months and years, and you don't have to input a single extra red cent. MOBILE STRIKE IS A MONEY PIT, a black hole for your hard earned money (actual money), and they got my last coin for sure. I only hope other people don't waste their time in building up a base only to find out they WILL get overrun, destroyed, your commander killed by someone who was prepared to blindly hand out 99.99 or more to steamroll over those of us who refused to do so. Just saying...\sMobile Strike is a lousy excuse for a game. Epic, has plainly constructed a platform that has enabled a typical swindle to satiate avarice. The game is extreamly frustrating. I played this game when it initially debuted and enjoyed it for a number of months. When I stopped the first time I had just passed level 21 and within a few days they came out with level 22. There is a constant desire to spend money to keep your forces at a level to be effective. Most packs cost 99. After a year I returned back and there now is level 60's. epic provided a catch up pack for 4.99. Not bad I thought. The next pack was 19.00 to bring me to a level 90. Within 3 weeks they are offering level 125's. the numbers used to track resources are astounding. Numbers like Million - Trillion- Trillion- Trillion (MTTT) (MTTT). Epic continuously is updating the game, ever increasing the necessity to pay additional packs to attain the next level. Once a level is extended they are enhancing the newest power levels by factors of 10. By doing that a person with a lesser power level does not stand a chance battling an opponent that is 10 times stronger. So, the 4.99 catch up offer suddenly became into 99 packs to keep up. The current edition of the game demands two power steps a week to be competitive. I would definitely recommend to stay away from this so called game.",Yes
Boring. Slow crash. Don't spend your time. Removed it immediately after.,Yes
You can get booted out of the game for both in if somebody who has greater power says so and theres nothing you can do\sI would not know I downloaded it and was unable to play it on my fire,Yes
"This game was pretty fun at first; formed an alliance and met some really great people. Unfortunately within approximately two months it became such an apparent money trap that many stopped playing because we could not keep up with the cost to stay competitive. The packs start off cheap (5, then 20), but eventually rise to 100, even 200. At a particular level, there are items that are needed for advancement in the game, but can ONLY be gotten by purchasing a pack. This is simply my perspective of the game, and I would highly encourage reading other reviews from others before downloading.",Yes
"The game keeps pushing upgrades and boosts on you every minute you play. Not only that, once you pay for a kit, they raise the price and keep doing it without providing it at the same price ever again. And if you don't spend any money then you can't actually compete and are just there to be defeated and lose all your progress. Not worth your money or your time.",Yes
"This game is a Huge money sinkhole and is meant to trap you into spending large amounts repeatedly. I played for a couple of weeks, spent a lot of money, built up a large fort and military force only to undergo a ""major onslaught"" that wiped me out demanding another significant amount of actual money. The packages of resources are substantially pricedólowest and smallest is 4.99 (doesnt last long) up to 99.00. Although it is fun to play (but not easy to grasp), it will cost you more than any other in-app purchasing games that I have played. Can't recommend",Yes
For a game that has been on the market as long as this it is utterly pitiful that it has severe stability concerns. It crashes constantly on multiple Android devices. Completely unacceptable. Between the awful stability and the fact that you actually have to pay hundreds-thousands of dollars to not be a doormat the game is a huge waste. Don't bother.,Yes
"EVERY review I have read is spot on This game is a big ploy aimed to bleed you dry of your hard earned money. Make no mistake. They care not about you, your game experience or anything of the type. Full game problems, awful lag that makes competing impossible and brutally annoying. You're a little fish if you spend even as much as 500 American Dollars per week. The customer service or lack thereof is absolute horse manure CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT IS RIGHTTo whomevers' Lawgroup decides to really take this to the courtroom. BRAVO, and thank you I hope you take them the the cleaners like they have been taking us for the previous 3 years or so. We are ALL ready to join the list to take these scumbags to court and return OUR cash back where it rightfully belongs. DO NOT. I REPEAT, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME",Yes
Too many releases need to be spending all the time in order to stay caught up. Right now have so many troops but cannot even participate in anything needing to keep protected all the time thus no fun to be had unless you spend hundreds,Yes
"Unfortunately it won't let me rank any lower, this item was a waste of power and memory, I assume there's a lot of persons who like wasting their time paying foe the ability to move s*** around I simply ain't one of them.",Yes
"other reviews right on. it's a money grab and you cannot compete or play without paying thousands. the game is not an action game. they basically ask you for a hundred bucks every time you log in to conduct endless research which becomes obsolete after a week.. the marketers are accurate, it is addictive in a horrible sense because you think you are making progress in this scam but you can't. plus you can lose the money you just spent suddenly by getting destroyed by bigger bases...makes it gambling, not gaming.",Yes
No stars they where fun but now they are demanding people to spend 100/day to keep up and if you dont you arent permitted to play. Too much new insignias gear research... cant play anymore too much upgrades to fast. New upgrades virtually everyday. So everything you buy is obsolete in 24hrs or less. Dont bother playing waste of time and money. Not fun at all. MS is greedy and made the game awful. Only guys that make 6 figures up can afford to play this game.,Yes
This game is incredibly expensive and the authors alter the game so frequently that the goods that you just spent money on become obsolete. Be prepared to pay at least 500 to compete properly. I hope I never spend a dollar on this game because honestly it's worthless and I can't even sell my account to re-coop close what I've paid.,Yes
"If you have money to waste and don't mind support ignoring you, then this game is great for you. I was stupid enough to spend money and got no where. Others leveled up rapidly and then it makes the game nearly unusable for others. I don't suggest.",Yes
"This game is not like anything in the commercials or demos that you see while playing other smartphone games. The game itself is quite glitchy and often shuts down on you unexpectedly. Pros:+ Addicting and fun+ Pretty in depth method with a longer learning curve Areas for improvement:- Glitchy, app randomly stops down- Too many adverts to spend money and buy packs- Sometimes the notifications do not work properly I would give this more stars if it wasn't so glitchy and they didn't harass you with adverts to spend money. Be warned: the game is incredibly addicting and in order to get anywhere, be competitive, or experience the full aspects of the game you have to pay real money...\scan't figure out how to accomplish anything in this game",Yes
"Giving it one star simply because I can't give it a zero. Complete piece of junk that's not worth the price of ""free.""",Yes
Consumes your time and continually asks you to spend money on upgrades. You can't be successful in this game unless you consistently dump money into the game. There for it wasn't entertaining after a time. I don't suggest this to anyone.,Yes
"Waste of time. Tons of endless jobs to progressively acumulate assets, ammo, labor, etc. Not my type of game. Uninstalled it after 30 minutes.",Yes
"This is not the coin pack I wanted to purchase. I wanted the 10,000 coin pack, cuz you get a higher discount and more savings. But it would only enable me to purchase 2 of the smallest packs of coins, and I only saved .40. That was not even worth the time I vested in attempting to earn the savings in the first place. The only reason I tried making the purchase for these smaller packs is because I was told by one of your technical support person to do it first, and then try the bigger pack. After making the purchases for the lesser packs comma it cut me off. And I was not able to make another purchase at all, let alone the larger pack that I was trying to ultimately buy. So in the long run I wasted an allot of my time and money purchasing the smaller packs of coins in the first place. I was ultimately rewarded for it. Thank you for that. But I would have really loved for this issue to have been fixed for any future purchases I would like to make for coin packs.",Yes
"Way to pricey to play. If you want to be competitive then plan to shell out hundreds per month. Greedy company... I invested into the thousands over a period of a few months and I couldn't go close to being competitive. So... I quit and transferred my account to a friend. The game is pretty uninteresting unless you have hours to waste. Lot's of useless click/tap only to improve XP etc. When I say lots... I mean hundreds of repetitive taps over and over... I fell asleep numerous times doing this dull task. So, I don't suggest this game to anyone and if I were Arnold... I would get my face off the game myself. Game has potential but money has poisoned the firm and I don't see it lasting very long without a huge change in how they do business.",Yes
"Another one of the army stuff, that I can't deal with. Also not Works really nicely for the younger crowd",Yes
I dont enjoyed this game but things have changed. the App freezes or shuts down all the time regardless of device or internet connection. This game is falsely marketed as free to play. You have no chance of playing if you can't pay at least 200 every few days due to the continual introduction of new things that can fully overpower all existing stuff. They have run thousands of people away with the ridiculous cost.,Yes
You can't progress ahead in the game unless you buy a new pack once or twice a week. Money hole. Not working,Yes
Money hungry developers. Fuck them all . New updates at least once every week. Worthless unless you're a billionaire - but if so why would you waste your time on this game.,Yes

"extremely stupid Instead of hiring Arnold, they need to have invested more money on the game. The game always crashed just as I was ready to enter battle, it is extremely slow, and there is no one to battle, so I'm sad that I'll never get the time back that I wasted on it.

"I only purchased this app in order to link my iPhone to my Firestick. worked well and connected quickly with no issues. I didn't like that I kept showing ads for the past 5*. I recognize their desire for you to use the paid services. Just for that reason, I had already uninstalled it. When trying to zoom with individuals, there are too many headaches, and the adds keep rising. NOTE: If you only use Android and wish to mirror with the Firestick, follow these instructions. There's no need to apply. On the Firestick, look under settings and you'll find it there.",Yes

"Come on, we knew they had nothing, but now since it doesn't work, why can't we just do something enjoyable? I just don't see why they don't provide us actual SnapChat instead of pointless fake apps because some of us have social lives. I really want SnapChat:",Yes
"It's useless because you can't even chatóSnap Chat is incorrect, but others in my class use it.",Yes
"I was thrilled to discover the Kindle edition because my sister-in-law had this on her iPad. The only drawbacks I've encountered are that the game may occasionally lock up and that it can be difficult to understand the hints because they flash on the screen so quickly. For more seasoned gamers, this may not be a problem, but I really enjoy it when it doesn't block me from playing after I load it and press the play button. numerous times.

"Really horrible, it abruptly stopped and I was unable to send texts any longer.",Yes
unable to send or receive SMS messages,Yes
"It won't take my email address or password, therefore I can't use it.",Yes

I can't log in to the app with my Kindle,Yes
"Exactly what I needed it to do. I frequently text using it, but there are a lot of issues. Texting someone was first a little difficult due to the layout, which is unfortunate.",Yes
Please address all screen layout problems as it is preferable to the alternative.,Yes
"Terrible I unintentionally destroyed my number, and I'm unable to get a new one. The app didn't have any instructions or side links that would have provided guidance. Simply choose a number for yourself, that's all. I have no idea how to choose a number to text to or how to dial out. terrible application",Yes

"I put it on my daughter's Kindle. It's possible that I misinterpreted, but I believed it to be a free software that I could use for my kids.

It turns out that the TextMe app's phone that was assigned to me was really given to someone else for their new phone.",Yes

"I could only use TextMe after downloading it if I paid 4.99 per week or 8.99 per month. What is unlocked? I am unable to enter anyone's name, let alone their home or cell numbers or addresses. I wonder whether my receptive processing impairment has anything to do with how useless it is for me. Almost everything I try and fail at, I miss out on. I'm over it. I discover they are billing me 59 each month two days afterwards. If I knew how, I'd file a lawsuit. They get away with it in this way. What BS",Yes
"It's incredible that you can text and call. The speaker doesn't function, you can't face time unless you both have the app, and calls arrive later than they do, but it still contains everything I need.",Yes
"Yes, it does work. I think that's it. 1. The app opens only partially of the time since it is so slow. 2. You can't do anything till the adverts have loaded. 3. Notifications are at best subpar, occasionally sending six or seven for a single text. 4. After the most recent upgrade, I am unable to name my talks. Totally useless app.",Yes
"The software asks me to provide 5 credits for each and every SMS I attempt to send, despite repeatedly stating in their descriptions that you may TEXT COST-FREE [""Free Texting (actual SMS messages) to any Phone number in the United States, Canada, and 40 countries.""]. All of this was sent to various different US numbers I tried to text from the US-based number they gave me (213-375-xxxx). There are other other user-interface issues, so I won't waste time mentioning them all. I do not serve as a volunteer beta tester. In a minute, the app will be removed from my Kindle Fire.",Yes
"My first straightforward issue is adding contacts, and the Kindle Fire is not mentioned in the help options. Because it loads so slowly and I've heard that you can only make calls occasionally per month, I am getting nothing for the money I've already paid. Don't install this app; it's terrible.",Yes
"My first straightforward issue is adding contacts, and the Kindle Fire is not mentioned in the help options. I'm receiving nothing for my previous payments.",Yes
"The issue began when my account was unable to receive calls. Big error, I created a phone number for my business using the app. I posted the phone number all over the city on signage and on the website. My business drastically slowed down since I couldn't answer calls. I was unable to get in touch with anyone at the business. I sent over ten emails, but I kept getting the same canned response.

"bro, it's not working. The app doesn't recognize their Bluetooth headset as being connected, which is the sole issue. Just fix it",Yes

"Don't download this software since it's bad and it doesn't work. I wish it did since it would be a lot of fun, but the app won't be worth your time to download. because it is ineffective. Gratitude - Amazon User",Yes
"Very terrible Every time I try to create an account, it will first ask for a list of characters, and then when I push the next button, it will ask me to complete a series of dumb tests to ensure that I am not a robot. As a result, I am unable to even create an account. Please, Amazon, send us genuine Snapchat.",Yes
"I don't like to be nasty or mean, but Snapchat is a poor app and a waste of time. Stop producing bogus apps, you guys. People want the actual app.",Yes
"BAD APP SNAPCAT IS REAL IN THIS. WHAT WE WANT IS AMAZON. I BEG YOU, PLEASE, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS PERVERT APP AS ALL IT CONTAINS IS PERVERTS. I had random following right away and am unable to block them because it is not Snapchat.",Yes
"VERY BAD APP, you can't modify anything, and it asks you to confirm that you are not a robot before allowing you to view another page. Additionally, I can't think of even one instance of how disrespectful the names were. I reiterate: It's a VERY BAD APP, which is why your tablets cost $50, so GIVE US REAL SNAPCHAT, AMAZON.",Yes
"I find it offensive, and I fail to understand why plain Snap Chat can't be downloaded.",Yes
"Give us the genuine Snap Chat, Amazon. Nobody likes this fake garbage, and not even a coder would take advantage of this deal. Disregard this nonsense. A waste of three seconds.",Yes
"Installing the bogus SnapChat version and downloading Google Play are the better options than doing anything else. Don't waste your time on this, please.",Yes
"so foolish Despite the fact that I detest this app since it is pointless and foolish, I continue to receive snaps. After this was done to my account by someone else, I can't seem to stop it.",Yes
This app is a waste of time. Downloading Kindle would be a waste of time because it might work much better.,Yes
"I am unable to use Snapchat, even though I'm sure it works perfectly.",Yes
I'm not even able to register. unfit for use. Waste. It's not what I expected,Yes
"This is complete nonsense. Do you folks truly read these evaluations, I ask you politely? You guys have been playing games with me, and I'm sick of it. Sincerely, you will eventually meddle with the wrong person and, hopefully, be held accountable for your scams. I can't wait until I get a phone because I'm almost finished with Amazon. Even the most basic program for my academic work cannot be downloaded. I'm going to get the grade in place of you if making genuine apps is that difficult or if you're just too lazy to truly make things so simple. This is coming from an 11-year-old who finds it sad that it needs to be that way and I know I'm not the only one who is sick and tired of it. If you don't read these, get ready for a ton of crazy phone calls. I'm sure everyone who downloaded it wants to throw their Amazon tablet, phone, or whatever out the window.",Yes
"What on earth is happening here? I erased it as soon as I saw it after receiving it. You can't do anything with Evan on it, so don't buy it. It's terrible; I prefer the real Snapchat than some bogus bullshit.",Yes
I detest this one and wish Amazon would just purchase the genuine Snapchat rather than these imitations that pretend users must text their buddies. It is so boring that I sign up for nothing.,Yes
"One of the worst games I've ever played of this kind, in my opinion. Gameplay that is monotonous, slow, and repetitive. If you aren't ready to play this game till you're retired, run, don't walk, away from it. a time waster. Did I mention that it was boring? You have received a warning.",Yes
"It would be a lot of fun if I didn't have trouble clicking on things. It wasn't my computer; the issue was with the game; every time I tried to click something, it would freeze before unfreezing. I had to uninstall it at some point.",Yes
"On my brand-new Kindle, I am unable to access the game's current state.",Yes
"If you like playing games where you don't win, this is for you. I stopped playing.",Yes
"decent game, however there is a very overt attempt to get you to spend real money. restricted game play unless you pay for ""energy,"" ongoing discounts and promotions, Not a good",Yes
The game is ruined by the sheer amount of nonsense that is going on. waste of time.,Yes
"Although thoughtfully planned and carried out, the problem surfaces as you try to make a substantial progress. It cannot be done without spending a significant amount of money. I'm going to remove what might have been one of the best games I could have found when I get there. It's a shame.",Yes
"Last night, as I was nearly finished with level 36, the game crashed and I was unable to proceed.",Yes

Not sure.... I got the app and i can't figure out how to use it.I might figure it out later but for now it is a three star app.,Yes
"Can't say it's legit, but can't say that it's fake either. It's been saying iffy things that don't make much sense, though I assume it's because it's an entertainment app, but I had my phone over my Xbox that my Dad got me when I went to visit him while he was a contractor in the United Arab Emirates, and it said GIFT, then said TYPE when it was by my laptop keyboard.",Yes
"Weird Game. I was doing this app this mornin and it was "" workin"" well. But when my dog came in, nothin was showin up. I just don't get that. I am not sayin this app works or not but maybe it was just a queinedinke. I deleted it anyway but just a waste of time. you can try it but you will regete it, y'all. I an't ever goin belive in ghosts, y'all.",Yes

Crashes continually on my kindle fire.† Can't use it.,Yes
"I downloaded this app for my MacBook Pro on 10/13/13.† It has failed to work on my MacBook.† I have tweeted my issue.† In addition, I have emailed support.† I sent an email with the PDF files that I was trying to open.† I also included a video showing the app is not working properly.† It has been 3 days.† This is beyond frustrating that I cannot get the proper support to resolve the issue.† I contacted AppleCare, and they stated everything is working properly on my Mac.† I cannot believe that I cannot receive assistance with an app that I purchased.† This is ridiculous.† I purchased and downloaded another app that is very similar to this one and it works perfectly.† More importantly, I have left a review of this application giving it another terrible rating.† The likelihood of this app succeeding after my App Store review, tweets, and Facebook comments posts is very slim.† Clearly, customer reviews are very important to consumers.† I am beyond disappointed in how the support department has ignored my issue.† Furthermore, I have requested a refund for this app.† This is the worst experience that I have had with an application.† I have hundreds of applications on my Mac, iPad, and iPhone and all of them function as stated except for the one from your company.† Each time this app crashes a crash report is sent to Apple.† Does your company receive a copy of this report?† I am going to guess that you do receive a copy of this report.† Apple is a very innovative company in the number 1 brand in the world.† I can't imagine why you haven't reviewed the crash report.† However,† I was advised by AppleCare that I can callback with my case number and they will begin a process to investigate my complaint in detail.† I will be contacting them today!Thank you,Toya Hayden",Yes

I still can't see what it finds when it says it finds a virus what or where the virus was found at,Yes
"Why they want a review before I have a chance to see whether or not my Kindle performs any better makes little sense to me.After a quick review of my Kindle, I was able to remove over 100 ""problems"" and two viruses for a $3.99 update.If I find a really noticeable improvement in the performance of my Kindle HDX, I shall update my review.",Yes

However I've been unable to figure out how to use the Pan/Tilt controls at all using the Remote for the Amazon Fire Stick (there are only so many buttons on the remote and none of them seem to be related to the ptz controls). Yes I can view the camera, but an important part (for me at least) in it being useful is the ability to pan/tilt. If someone see's this and would be able to explain how to make the camera move with the Fire Stick Remote, or I manage to figure it out myself, I'd be very grateful and would be happy to update this review.",Yes

"Does not work as a means of mirroring an iOS device to a FireStick. March 3, 2020I was looking for an app that would allow me to display photos/home videos etc. from my iPhone & iPad to a non-smartTV via my Amazon FireStick.† This app supposedly does that using the Apple AirPlay protocol built in to the newest Apple mobile devices.† I downloaded the AirScreen app onto the FireStick from the Amazon website and installed it on the FireStick according to the instructions.† According to the pre-loaded tutorial video bundled with the app, I should then have been able to go to any iOS mobile device with AirPlay enabled and from the ControlCenter, scan for other Airplay compatible device connected to the same WiFi network (which the FireStick was) and select that device and begin mirroring.† Unfortunately the app was unable to detect either my iPhone or my iPad although both had AirPlay enabled and both were connected to the same WiFi network.I then called Amazon Tech Support and spent about an hour on the line with them while they logged in to remotely view my FireStick screen and operate it remotely.† The were unable to solve the issue so the called Apple Support, making it a 3-Way conference call.† The Apple support rep remotely logged on to my iPad and operated it remotely.† Again, no one was able to make the iPad connect with the FireStick.† Since I had already tried and had the same problem with an AirPLay enabled iPhone also, it seemed unlikely to me and to the Apple rep that both iOS devices were malfunctioning but rather that it was either the FireStick and/or the app itself that was the problem.† The Apple rep came to the same conclusion, so she departed from the conference call.The Amazon rep remained on the line and we did some further checks to determine if there were any other problems with the FireStick itself, which there were not.† Every other non-AirScreen related function of the FireStick appeared to be working normally so we all concluded that there must be a problem with the app itself.I had downloaded the free/demo version of the app, which claims to function fully without upgrading to the paid version, but with advertising pop-ups.† I was not going to pay to upgrade until i saw the app work as advertised, which had it done so, I would then have paid to upgrade to the ad-free version.† Accordingly I do not know if the upgraded version would have worked properly or not.In short, this app does not do what it claims to do and therefore should be considered useless for the purpose of mirroring an iOS device to a FireTV device.",Yes
"Useless to me.. Thought it was a method to view other movies, it is not nor does it show what can be done with it. A waste of time and money.",Yes
"Didn't connect or show up.. So I downloaded this app in hopes that I could stream directly from my 2019 Macbook Air. Everything seemed fine and the app seemed clean, but when it came time to actually connect, my device did not recognize my firestick as an airplay source. It never popped up and I am unable to use it. Disappointing.",Yes
"Unable to connect. It worked a couple of times and we paid for it. Now, nothing. Open the app and I get a blank screen on my device. Extremely disappointed.",Yes

"It's garbage. I try to record A game and I record and save, I can't watch it at all, or it did not record at all",Yes
"M. H.. I don't like it honestly. It's simple but I don't like the adds or in app purchases, it only lets me record for a limited amount of time, I think this is because recording apps are not very good on kindle fires, it doesn't really record very well and has very bad quality. I don't recommend this app to kindle fires. The only way to find a good recording app is to buy one probably ??I'm giving it two stars because it could be worse.",Yes
Just another dumb game. Wished these developers would do something more .... Just another dumb game.† Wished these developers would do something more useful with their skills and time.† There are plenty of social problems to solve!,Yes
"Its not good. I can't record, it keeps on automatically stopping and when ever I try to edit the video its just a white screen. I just want a WORKING SCREEN RECORDER!!!!!! Very disappointed. ??",Yes
Waste of time.. Not used deleted,Yes
No place for new account. Iíve tried a few different streams and when they have a phone number to call it generally is not available in my region so when I see this now I uninstall the app.† Wish there was a way to determine if the app is only for certain locations prior to downloading.† It is a waste of my time,Yes
waste of time. Trashy Movies Channel does not even deliver well on cheesy movies to kill an afternoon.,Yes

In order to perform a printing task it is like you have to go through the procedure twice. The print options are very limited and 1 major problem it does not allow you to double side your output.Kindle OS really needs to be updated to something simple and useful for a simple task as printing from the device.VERY!

No good. Does not work! So it is pointless to download . Don't bother getting it† I think it is a waste of time .,Yes
"Bad port of a good service.. The worst aspect of this app is that it continually fails to push messages from people. Often I will message someone only to suddenly have several messages sent to me hours before suddenly load. To the other people, it just appears I am ignoring them. Signing on to the desktop app at the same time will make the messages show up and be received immediately, but then what is the point of using the app if I have to use the desktop?The interface was already bad and they continue to make it worse with each update. Now contacts are separated into a long alphabetical directory rather than simply allowing you to see who is online at a glance. The desktop interface is fine, and I'm not sure why they feel the need to try and deviate from it.You cannot choose any status but online or invisible. Worse, you can't see if anyone else has their status set as away or busy. You simply see them as online, when in reality they may not want to be disturbed.The desktop program is fine. The mobile app however is handicapped in several ways. If you need a way to use Skype from your phone or tablet, this is unfortunately your best option. If you are just looking for a video/instant messaging app that doesn't need to be Skype, then choose something else.",Yes
"New skype. I thought it was me being useless but have read the reviews 're the new Skype and,thankfully it's not. I can't sync contacts, or even use the new Skype on my kindle fire,although it's useable on my phone.",Yes
"Skype for Kindle DOES NOT WORK. Garbage. Zero Stars. Skype for Kindle Fire HD simply doesn't work. Connect for a few seconds and then it crashes. There has been no update for a year [Jan 2014~Dec 2014] so obviously neither Amazon, Skype or Microsoft care about Kindle users. If one of the reasons you carry a tablet it to keep in touch, then not having skype is a very real reason to throw your kindle in the bin† and upgrade to another android, or apple based tablet. SKYPE SUCKS.",Yes

"Here is a quick summary below:Pro:-Very fast pre-rendering of pages at a low-resolution-Large thumbnail pages on the side bar for quick preview of pages before and after the current pageCon:-Problem displaying text boxes created by other PDF programs without re-adjusting the box size (when text border is being used)-Problem displaying continuous fine lines when the page is zoomed out to show the larger extent of the page-Problem locating the annotations correctly created by other PDF application such as EZ PDF.-Lack the ability to adjust font size for typed notes.Device used to try the program: Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (10 inch display with 1280x800 resolution)Other full version PDF apps tried before: ezPDF reader, Office Suite, PDF to Go, Polaries Office, Quickoffice, Adobe PDFFULL REVIEW:I have tried many PDF apps before and the one thing I wished most of them have is the large thumbnail display of pages at the side bar like the popular desktop PDF programs such as Adobe PDF and Bluebeam. This features allows users to quickly look up information and have a better sense of where one is at within a chapter. Thus, I decided to give this app a try since I noticed it has the ability to display large thumbnail preview in the side bar.After playing the app for a while, I was disappointed. As listed above, this app has issue displaying text boxes created by other applications. If the box is not large enough it will not show any text inside at all unlike ALL other programs that I have tried. Another disturbing shortcoming is its inability to show fine lines without breaking. I have scanned images of books with tables and charts that appear to have missing borders when† zooming to show the full extent of the page. Worst of all, when loading file with large page size (30"" x 42"" drawing with vector lines generated by AutoCAD or Revit), the drawings become almost unreadable because I can barely see the lines when the page is zoomed out to show even just a quarter of the drawing. Another glaring problem is the inconsistency to display text and object created by other programs. In one instance, when opening a PDF file annotated by ez PDF, half of the texts and annotations are displayed at a completely wrong location. Finally, I did not find any property menu that allows a user to change the font size of the text annotation. The lack of this particular function forces me to cram large text on document with small page size. On the opposite hand, the single sized text annotation on documents with large page format becomes difficult to find.In short, those flaws make the program not the best choice for users who intent to make a lot of typed annotations and wish to open documents with diagrams, tables and graphics (such as textbook and technical documents). And it is a poor choice for those who would like to open large architectural or engineering drawings especially when the drawings were already annotated by other programs before. I will rather stick to other programs for now before those issues have been resolved by the developer.",Yes
PDF documents look terrible on my nexus 7 / android 5.1.1 due to the awful font used. I can't find a way to change the default font. Not usable for me this way.,Yes
"I couldn't get the get the product to work. I intend to return it. I tried to find help in the app and could not.† I tried to find help on google.† Which I am virtually ALWAYS successful at on any question I need answered (and I am a techy).† and although google did answer my question it gave me a simple easy solution to the problem. Don't use the app. Just transfer the file to kindle via email with convert in the subject line. Viola problem solved.So I don't know if the product is any good or not, but I can't get it to work.",Yes
"I bought this Android App because I have worked with the iOS version a lot (on my iPhone). It wasn't quite as good as Good Reader (which I use on my iPad and has Dropbox SYNC!) but the iOS version is one of the better PDF annotating apps for iOS. And I have tried many PDF apps on both platforms before.Since they advertise† ""PDF Max is the 5-star rated, full-featured PDF reader used by millions of iPhone/iPad users world-wide and now available for Android""† I was happy to get at least that much PDF functionality for my Android device and went ahead and bought it.BUT BOY, WAS I DISSAPPOINTED!A lot of things that made it great on iOS are simply not there or don't work properrly:- NO TABS for multiple open documents!- Poor file browser which quits when you try to open a document that is located deeply within your folder structure- Slow rendering of certain PDFs (in comparison to the iOS app BUT ALSO IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER ANDROID APPS such as Adobe Reader, RepligoPDF Reader, ezPDF Reader Foxit Mobile PDF etc...- When you select the freehand annotating tool and set its opacity to anything other than 100% it seems to work but after saving it it will be back to 100% and therefore cover any text / element you really wanted to be visible- No step-by-step undo button during highlighting and other annotating tools- Undo button on freehand annotating tool doesn't work most of the time.- Frequent crashes of the app when working with larger size PDFs- Problem locating the annotations correctly created by other PDF application such as EZ PDF.- Lack the ability to adjust font size for typed notes.For anyone that has professionally used the iOS version (or the all time best GoodReader app) this app is unacceptable!It is so not comparable that I WOULD LIKE MY MONEY BACK and if the app would have been advertised in such a way on the Apple App store they would have reimbursed me!Again, even if they advertise it this way, THE ANDROID VERSION IS NOT COMPARABLE TO THE iOS VERSION!In my opinion it is simply NOT READY FOR PROFESSIONAL USE !",Yes

"Doesn't work with shared printers over a network. My fiance's printer is shared through her desktop computer. As far as I can tell so far there is no way for this app to detect printers that aren't WiFi networked printers.

"Waste of my time. From the title of the app, I thought I could ìstream and watch liveî sports.† That is incorrect.† I could watch only replays of sports news.† In order to watch sports events, you have to have a cable or satellite subscription. I guess if I were in the road and wanted to watch a random game, that would be ok. However, I cut the cable so I could stream. This app is worthless to me.",Yes
Waste of time. Super lame. This is pointless. You canít watch live events without paying for something free on television. Itís just a feed of the lame verision of ESPN but more off-putting,Yes

"Buffering took quite a long time.... I was hoping to catch a bit of the Super Bowl so was excited to live stream it via this app. Unfortunately, I would only get about 2 minutes of coverage before a 60 second pause for buffering.

"Same horrible broadcast from CBS. It is nice to see a free AP available to watch something that you should be able to get over-the-air transmission. But, CBS broadcast is horrible over-the-air (compared to other stations in the same area)...so you try the CBS website...nope that still is devoid of atmospheric pressure (ie has a vacuum...hence it well...sucks). And, finally when you get to the free app...its no better. CBS seems so so far behind the competition when it comes to delivering a solid and reliable digital broadcast whether it be over-the-air or on the wire.

My WatchESPN, NBC Sports, and Fox Sports all stream live events with the credentials of my DirecTv account. I'm not about to pay an addition monthly fee for CBS's ""Watch Now"" service.

This is the sleaziest garbage sports network I have ever seen. A waste of money on every level, and a major disappointmentfrom CBS.",Yes
"No live content. This app has no live streaming content. I don't know why anyone would want to check scores on their FireTv when we have computers and smartphones.

"What the hell did they do to this?. 5-13-19 -- New update.† Don't get it.† Can't get my local programming anymore (Fox Sports Wisconsin).† Says I have to go to the Fox Sports Go App to do so.† That's great, but that's what this app is.† Horrible, horrible update.† Needs to be rescinded.† I have to watch on my computer now because the app for the Fire TV Stick is now junk.† Very disappointed and upset.",Yes
"Uninstalled. The NFL has now gotten to the point that you can't even listen to the game on your favorite hometown radio station via an internet stream so there's not a whole lot this app can or does do for you for free.The NFL says ""you want real live football or even an audio stream? Get out your checkbook and pay ~$100 per month for our ""Red Zone"" or whatever the package is.<soapbox>The fact that people still have brand loyalty to any given team is understandable and I still pull for the perennially dreadful Detroit Lions but it's hard to see past what a pure, capitalistic business it is sometimes. There's nothing wrong with that - that's called playing the game of capitalism as it's meant to be played - but it's not something you would imagine would inspire face-painting.</soapbox>Uninstalled.",Yes
"Still does not work on Amazon Fire. I made the mistake of updating the foxsports app without reading reviews; now it (the foxsports app) will not load any content. It tries, then gives the ""oops there is an error"" with the options to try again or go back. No amount of 'try again' will work.For the skeptics, yes I have tried: signing out then back in again, uninstalling the app (and clearing all data stored), reinstalling and starting over, sign in/activate. Each time the same result.It simply does not work with amazon Fire. It does still work on Apple tv and on my Ipad (same account).So that tells me Amazon is part of the problem here. Or simply remove the app if it does not work.",Yes
"You can download the app, but you can't watch football games. The app downloads immediately, but you can't watch sports unless you have a cable provider.† You only get a few minutes of the app before it asks you to input your cable provider",Yes
No 4K. 4K does not work.† Perhaps DirectV is blocking it since I donít have it with my package.† Streaming quality is lousy even though I stream 4K on other services with no issues,Yes
disappointed. i never got to watch any of the sports events i wanted to watch. had stereaming and prime issues that never got reolved.,Yes
"Not as advertised. This was supposed to be free and would access the Westminster Kennel Club dog show but every time I tried to see it, it said it wasn't supported through my provider.† Waste of time and big disappointment.",Yes
unable to find and watch NFL game. Was under the impression we could receive all NFL Games on my Firestick/Fox sports† for free.† Very misleading.† Missed the Washington game - Soooooo disappointed,Yes
Did not work with my DirectTV Now. Unable to determine what level of programming package is required to get this service if you are using Basic DirectTV Satellite and the streaming app of DirectTV Now. A huge disappoint to find local sporting content.,Yes
Not what I expected. I didn't realize that the only way to use the app is to have a cable connection in order to view it.† I went to Amazon fire for the purpose of getting rid of cable.† This would also apply to any other apps such as Starz and HBO and others that you can't view unless you have a cable connection.,Yes
Content was blocked after only one user. It let me watch one World Cup Game then when I went to look at it again for the 2nd game all content was blocked even though I successfully activated it through my provider Dish. Uninstalled,Yes
"Limited. It's Hockey season, where's the hockey games? Very limited choices.",Yes
No Good on Firestick. Charged me $87 for a sporting PPV and never could play it.† Told me they were having problems with it and would refund my money...still waiting,Yes
No go for me. This was a no go for me. I have streaming tv only and was not able to use it.. So here I am missing the World series with my home team :-( Still don't really understand why I can't seem to get it...,Yes
A Waste!. Not what I was looking for. I wanted out of market NFL games and its not happening. So no use,Yes
"Too bad the phone version of this app doesn't include chromecast. Too bad the phone version of this app doesn't include chromecast, but the Amazon version works generally fine on my Fire Stick. The first game I watched constantly buffered but the last game was fine the whole time. Difficult to tell if it was my network giving issues, but I have fast AC wireless and generous internet bandwidth typically. Pretty simple navigation.",Yes
Nothing. Waste of† time. It doesnt work. Asks for your tv provider.,Yes
"Worthless without a t.v. cable provider. My friend had recently cut the cord with his cable tv provider, and told me that he was unable to get this app to work.† As I too have recently cut the cable tv cord, I am also unable to use this app.† Why do I need this if I still have cable, or Dish?† Pretty much a worthless waste of time, and application.",Yes
Waste. Don't Bother,Yes
"don't get what they say. Downloaded FOX sports to watch the NFL games yesterday and was never able to access the game.† It is supposedly no charge added to my sling/fire stick account, however I was blocked and not able to see anything on it.† Needs to not show that you have NFL access when you DON'T.",Yes
I could not get a live stream. Sitting at home with my Wi-Fi at full strength I will still not able to get a live stream even though I have signed into my provider so I immediately removed this particular app from my tablet I didn't see a reason for taking up the space if it wasn't going to work as expected it was unfortunate but unless they were something that I was doing wrong I don't think that I would reinstall it again it just didn't do what I wanted it to do and it was a waste of my time,Yes
"Worst streaming app I have used.. App buffers way to much. Quite possibly the worst streaming app I use.† Or attempt to use. No other apps on my fire TV have any problems or issues. Between the buffering and airing the same commercials on every commercial break, the app is just horrible.",Yes
Not What I Expected. I didn't like this program as it didn't give me the programming I was expecting. It was a waste of my time.,Yes
"Waste. In order to use this app you basically need cable.† We have high speed Internet, Netflix and a fire stick but we donít have traditional cable.† We were unable to watch the vents we wanted.† Total waste",Yes
Meh. Unable to find a baseball game,Yes
Very Disappointed!. I can't believe that you would offer an app that requires you to use another TV provider to access!† Really???,Yes
"Fox problems w/ direct TV. I am an old guy, took awhile to get this thing figured out, but I did. I could watch the game but the picture quality was very poor.",Yes

"terrible user interface, unreliable streaming, slow to connect, lower res ""HD"". Boy do I regret believing the reviews on Fubo.† Yes, they have some sports coverage that's hard to get elsewhere.† But it's not worth it.Firstly the user interface is really really bad.† Who designed this thing?† It's clunky, allows very little customization, gives limited information about shows, makes it difficult to change channels, etc. etc.Then you find that it takes some time after you switch to a new channel to get a non-blurry picture.† What?† Are you running this out of your basement, Fubo?And every so often there's an outage.† Unexplained and usually unreported, but there you go, you can't get that stream now.† Has happened to me more than once, and usually right when there was a ""I don't want to miss this"" event.† I've stopped keeping track.Finally, all the so-called HD streams are really at 720p, not 1080p.† There's one ""experimental"" 4K channel, rarely has anything on it.Yeah, I've already cancelled my service, just waiting for the current sub to drain.† (Yes, drain is the right term.)† I'm considering Hulu -- it has most of the channels I want, and works well with Fire boxes. I'll miss the occasional La Liga and Ligue 1 and Serie A matches I was able to catch, but I can't justify Fubo for access to the few games I have time to watch.",Yes
"Unreliable streaming.† Poor customer service.. Horrible streaming.† Feed kept losing sound, then freezing, then going to a white screen before sending you back to the fubo home screen.† You have to reset the channel every 5-7 mins.I have fast and reliable internet service and no issues with the fire stick.Customer service only offered a partial refund $20/60.00 USD monthly advanced fee† (which could take up to 2 weeks to come back to me) and to close the account.† They said it could take up to 24 hours for a supervisor to call me back.† Unacceptable.Not worth the money.",Yes
"Not as advertised. Signed up to get live NFL games, but was only able to access the same game that I can see locally on my cable. Did not give access to other NFL games on at the same time showing in other regions. Waste of time.",Yes
"Kept freezing up. I tried fuboTV for 3 days with their 7 day free trial.† Very disappointed.† It kept freezing up and we had to wait, wait, wait.† Then I unplugged the Amazon Firestick I used for fubo, plugged my cable box back in and the problem went away with my cable service (with no fuboTV service).fuboTV needs a few more years to get its act together.",Yes
"Too expensive. I enjoyed this service, but in less than a year, they're raising the price $10/month for channels that don't interest me. I am ending my subscription this month as the price is more than my DirecTV used to charge me. Very disappointed and unable to get any response over the phone or via email to customer service. If you sign up now, your cost will increase in August by $10.",Yes
Not worth the cost.. Cost is just too high.† Not a service I would pay for.† Alot of these live t.v. steaming packages have the same problems that caused me to cut the cord.† Channels I don't want are bundled with few I do at a price I'm not willing to pay.,Yes
It's ok. Hate the fact you can't watch a channel while you scroll through another channel.† Also unlike youtube tv on your phone you can't watch it while you are multitasking using another app. Only plus it has the MSG channel.,Yes
"Pic quality sub par for sports. Picture quality for sports not good at all. Worse than youtubetv which is poor as well. Picture looks less than 720 for most sporting events. They only have FOX 4K which isnít enough to get me to sign up at this time. They also donít have TBS, TNT, and regional FOX sports networks. Expensive and DVR is limited unless you want to pay even more. Will let free trial expire. May look into it in the future if 4K offerings are expanded.",Yes
"SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT. I did† Free Trial hoping to be able to watch my NFL football team play, since it advertisements say that you can! WRONG! This is not much different than having your regular local TV Channels, UNLESS you want to pay extra for other channels, STILL NO WAY to watch my NFL games!! VERY DISAPPOINTED, CANCELLED FREE TRIAL AN HOUR AFTER SIGNING UP! WASTE OF TIME..",Yes
"Lack of usability. It's UI is just laggy & not very intuitive. The mobile app is a little better, plus 30hrs of DVR storage is lame. YouTube TV gives you unlimited DVR recordings for 8 months or so. Also, no ABC/ESPN/Disney family of channels. And it's too damn expensive for what you get & how polished the Smart TV app is.",Yes
Poor picture quality. I subscribed to Fubo hoping to see an archived Pac 12 game.† Was not able to do this so decided to watch a movie.† The stream didn't lock up but many times the picture was very blurry.† This was maybe due to our lame internet so I may be unfair in my rating.,Yes
Expensive.. Only problem to expensive for the same as all the other stremming channels.,Yes
Disappointing. Tried this specifically to watch the Chicago Bears on December 16 and was unable to do so. I cancelled the service.,Yes
Couldnít use.. We were at a campground. The wireless was not adequate to support fubo TV. I cancelled it. I was disappointed but not necessarily Fiboís problem.,Yes
"WARNING: IT'S A WASTE,† DON'T BUY IT. I do not recommend this service because even with a great internet connection, the stream kept cutting out or lagging, plus it was always about 30 seconds later than the live broadcast!! Not happy one bit,† very disappointed. I never give a bad review,† I simply choose to not say nothing at all, however, as a paying customer, I would've wanted to know.",Yes
Disappointing. We got this to watch football.† Doesn't work most of the time.† Haven't been able to watch a game all the way through due to error messages.† Amazon fire tv.† Disappointing.,Yes
MLB Division Playoffs. Viewed a portion of MLB division playoffs. For the 2nd game the viewing was discontinued right after the 7th inning and I was unable to watch the complete (9innings).,Yes
Boooooo. This ap sucks.† I'm forced to watch Gophers hockey on it whe the waste of space Timberwolves are on FSN.† It's constantly freezing and has a terrible picture half the time.,Yes
Just a Trial.† Don't waste your time.. Hated the trial trick.† You only get am extremely short trial loop. Everything else paid for by a micro transaction process. A waste of time.,Yes
"Not my cup of tea. Not at all what I expected.† Didn't catch my dogs attention much either. Did trial, didn't like it. And noticed months later I was being charged for it monthly though I didn't know and didn't want it. Wasted a bunch of money on nothing :/",Yes

"Not bad. Has cleaned up and cleared so mnemonic e issues which improved performance. However, does have adware which can be annoying.",Yes
Again a paid app.. Does not seem to get rid of all the viruses. Waste of money as always. Seems to thrive on advertising revenues.,Yes
My Review. It doesn't remove any problems from my device and I can't afford to pay for the app that does so it's pretty much worthless.,Yes
"Regrets on this one. Its a shame you can't give a review for less than one star. The free scan overview showed a gain of 1GB,† after purchasing and running the app, there was not a single MB of space gain and in the last 45 minutes the app has closed me out of my game 4 times to offer me additional products. Sorry I did this one.",Yes
"Only scans, no fix. Its Not Free , scans ypour tablet then trys to sell you another app to fix the ""problems""",Yes
Worthless. A scan that reports some numbers but doesn't do anything - except tell you to buy the cleaner - is a worthless waste of time.,Yes
"Not sure. Seems to work ,said would clean 2.2 mb, ran it said it cleaned. Scanned again and still said 22 needed cleaning.† Maybe a waste of time.",Yes
One Star. Big disappointmentwaste of time,Yes

"Disapointing. Did not work with Lorex cameras.. Would not work with my Lorex camers, which is the reason I purchased it.The application saw them in the scan but could not open them, this was while I was on the same local network, so remote viewing is definitely out of the picture.† I wasted my money on this application.",Yes
"App Only Worked on the LAN, and Not on the WAN - and there is no way to get a refund.. This App did not work when it was tried away from the LAN.† It is supposed to give camera access from anywhere you have an Internet connection once it has been set-up.† It did not.† How do I get a refund?Updated 11/30/17:† Answer:† You can't Companies can sell you software on Amazon that does not work as advertised, and there is no recourse for the Consumer.",Yes
"Waste of money for the app and time trying to .... VERY difficult to use/setup. Never have gotten it to work with the Swannsecurity cameras we have. Waste of money for the app and time trying to make it work. But if you want to look at random cameras around the world that have no description, this is for you! Because that is all that works.",Yes
"Limited use. I was only able to make 2 cameras work, does not support Astak mole, Lorex, a bit difficult to use.but what can I say?",Yes

Not a great app - the mirroring doesn't work well. Tried mirroring some videos from my phone to my TV...it just didn't work well. Very poor picture quality and lots of lag. Wouldn't suggest it.,Yes
"It may not work for you. Impossible to know until you buy it.. Depending upon the age of your tv, and if you are using a fire TV vs Fire Stick, there can be issues. I could not get my AT&T TV to stream from my phone to the television which is why I wanted it. Maybe for another use I would've rated it much higher.",Yes
"Don't waste your time unless your ok paying for the app required to mirror from device. Was really disappointed to see that the Amazon presented this as a no-cost on Fire TV and then when scanning the QR code for the app to mirror, it isn't free and the reviews are terrible...",Yes

"Doesn't work with iPhone. It simply did not work.† Unfortunately, you have to pay to download it before you know that it simply doesn't work.† After installing on Firetv, attempting to use it on an Apple iPhone running the Disney Plus app as soon as you attempt to share the screen using the AirBeamTV Mirroring Receiver app it blanks out the display on the phone and throws an error on the TV.",Yes
"Don't waste your money!. Awful app.† Constantly freezes and have to completely re-boot the system to get it to work.† Support says uninstall and re-install which doesn't fix the problem.† Save your 9.99† Fyi, the only reason I gave it 1 star is because I can't submit the review with 0 stars.",Yes

Quite useless. Donít waste your money. Its quite useless. It is cumbersome to use as it imitates screen recording on phone to mirror your screen.

"Not Ready For Kindle AppStore. I've played Mobile Strike off both Google and Kindle. It can be a fun time waster provided the application is stable but the Kindle Fire version needs a LOT of work. Obviously, the game designers have put more effort into squeezing your wallet full of your hard earned cash than developing a stable platform. If you're not familiar with MS it's similar in design to Game of War. You construct your base from resources you build but they must be constructed in a proper order. Constructions use resources and cost time. If you plan to spend some time with this game then it's worthwhile to read some of the guides on the net. Those avid, take no prisoners players will quickly decimate your bases, drain your resources and execute your commander. These players, seemingly with unlimited disposable income, dominate most of the areas in the game. A player can literally rack up tens of thousands of dollars with bonus crates with speedup, boosts, extra resources, power options and other powerful items offerred at a ""HUGE DISCOUNT"" ??. At one point your commander will be stuck at a particular level because you need to acquire 'commendations' which you have no choice but to purchase to get further in the game. This pay to play game is one of the worst I've seen in a long time! I'm shocked but not surprised that Arnold would endorse a game that takes advantage of their customers in this grossly unskilled combat game that you can only win by being the player that pays the most.",Yes
"So frustrating!!!!!!. Let me start by saying I LOVE this game! But I haven't been able to play in almost a week! The app keeps kicking me out and force closing to the app store with a memo that states that I don't have the app store so the app can't run.....and then it automatically sends me to the app store.....which obviously I have or it couldn't send me to it!!!! MADDENING ?? Fix my app, I beg of you! I miss my alliance! And playing the game!!!",Yes
"Terrible. Way to laggy and absolutely no fun at all to play. All the game consists of is tapping some &#34;buildings&#34; to level them up and getting &#34;missions&#34; fired in your face (you see what I did there?) UI is difficult to read, and game lags even if your WiFi is on 4 bars AND you have all other apps closed.",Yes

Waste of effort.. Legs constantly. My son deleted it as got frustrating.,Yes
Do not bother keeps crashing.. Waste of time. After down loading every time I tried to play the game it crashed and locked the kindle so I had to keep turning it off and restarting it. If I could give O stars I would.,Yes
Rich mans game. When I started playing 18 months ago the game was genius now because there new levels new gear and mods out every week and you have to buy packs to keep up players are bored and angry the way the game has progressed and† have left the game† you are constantly having to reboot your device when the game freezes or you get booted out during game play.there software is flawed and ruins thee experience of the game..you can complain to your hearts content yet you still having to buy packs to keep up.WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,Yes
Suffers from the same problem as most of these games .... Suffers from the same problem as most of these games after an initial flurry of action you end up spending 90% of your time waiting for last thing you did to finish or spending a lot of money in little bits to speed things up. I was playing the version from the kindle app store and the slow down on it made the game practically unplayable with waits for a response to clicking a building or and upgrade sometimes taking minutes to appear. After trying to play several times during the day I can say that was a game issue not a hardware one.,Yes
No time to enjoy with this quick moving game. Game moves forward to quickly it doesnt cater for people with limited funds i think they think everyone has an endless supply of cash game would suit millionaires and not ordinary folk,Yes
VERY VERY LAGGY. I can't believe I did not take any notice of the other reviews The most terrible lag on my Kindle Fire Really not worth the effort,Yes

"Avoid on Amazon Fire.. Had to write this as if your playing on Amazon fire this will apply to you too,game crashes every 10 or so minutes, sometimes longer sometimes less. Starts with chat crashing ( keyboard keeps flagging on and off ) followed by an app crash.EW it should be noted haven't a clue on what customer service looks like, never mind being able to implement anyting. Contacted them several times, explaining the issue, their only response reinstall game ( have done this probably more times than I've played it now ) or check for updates which its been upto date everyday. Wouldn't be so bad but this app does require somesortof spending to fully appreciate the game and for those rare moments when it works, its a great game, its being let down by stability issues and poor customer / technical support.Honestly I'd avoid if I were you and try the same format just the medieval version Game of War.No stability issues there and better free bonuses.",Yes

"Learn as you progress. .. I was really enjoying this game. Have spent over a month playing every night for several hours and finally got to rebuilding my ship. I know, not that far into the game by some standards. Turned it back on last night only to be back at the beginning and having to stat all over. I'll give It another try and hope it wont happen again† don't know if anyone else has had this problem.",Yes
Fun but can't buy coins. I love playing game but Amazon will not let me use my credit card to buy coins.!!!!,Yes
"Good game but buggy. As far as matching games go, this one is fairy decent. It adds the element of building a civilization along the way. Unfortunately, when using the Amazon Fire tablet, I encountered problems as the game progressed and the app itself would not always load. It was a bit frustrating having played so long only to have to uninstall it.",Yes
Settings. I absolutely love this game.† The only problem I have is having to log into FB† every time I open the game.† Now it was me stuck on a screen and will not pay me log in,Yes
"Frustrated. 3 stars for creatvity .† But I am constantly frustrated because when I'm† trying to finish a collection and tap on a charger to do it, I often get sent to a game level where the icon flashes. If† I successfully complete it, I rarely win the icon I want.† Instead, Empire gives me a prize I already have. Sometimes. 10 or 15 of them.† Often just close game in frustration.",Yes
was fun. First off I was really into this game at first. It has a storline that went with the game to rebuild the town. It's a matching game that I enjoyed. The big problem for me was after I rebuilt the hut(I think it was) the game started to lag so bad I could barely play the game. Sorry but I had to uninstall the game. It was fun while it lasted.,Yes
"Causing sleeplessness??. I've been playing this game for about 9 months.† Thought it was fun so kept playing.† I refuse to pay actual money for the gems so reading the reviews inspired me to quit this game as the farther along you go, the more you'll need to pay actual money to continue.† But my biggest concern is my inability to shut down my brain when I go to bed.† I see the moves jumping around in my head and have a really hard time falling asleep.† I bought blue-light reducing glasses to help with this problem but didn't appear to help much.† So I decided to quit playing the game.† It's been about 2 weeks now that I haven't played the game, and I am finally able to fall asleep the way I used to prior to playing this game.† I'm wondering if it's all similar games and not just Cradle of Empires.† Anyone else having this problem?† My sleep is more important than playing a game so no more games for me.† I'm going to go to the library and loan out actual books instead.",Yes
"Watch out for touch screen mistakes!. I have played the PC predecessors of this game and am familiar with the various challenges/roadblocks than many people whine about. I'm at level 29 and have spent nothing. My complaint or caution is that sometimes my moves are misread and my choice is ignored ...moves on the far side of the screen occur that I didn't choose to make. This frequently causes a loss of the level I am playing. Game updates have improved but not eliminated the problem. When you are playing a timed level, this can REALLY be a source of anger and frustration!",Yes
To hard. This game is addicting and to hard having to play each level so many times is not fun. There is to many problems with the game. Frezze up. Not same on the same level as my phone or table. Loading progress for a whole day. Time to give upMary,Yes
"It no longer loads!. I have played this for awhile and have had fun. Now, however, I can't get it to work. It just kicks me back to the app store or says I don't have an Amazon App store appwhen I clearly do. It's too frustrating to play now since I can't even play it!",Yes
"Could be better. Game itself is fun but it is obvious that the object of the game and the developers is to get you to spend money.† After advancing in the game and getting all my bonuses etc, I turned the game on to find that somehow all my progress was lost.† This happened 3 times so far.† Losing all that stuff and starting over again is frustrating.† Not to mention losing the stuff you paid for and can't get back.",Yes
Frustrating. There seems to be no logic to how this game operates. Play endlessly to collect a charge and you are rewarded with everything but what you seek. Waste of time.,Yes
"Totally addictive and completely frustrating!. I have also been playing for over a year and I get so mad that you have to go through a level a million times before getting the items to complete collections. Somehow I still love the game. I think I persist because I just won't let it beat me and I really curious to see what's coming up next. Please, please fix this issue before it becomes a lost cause.",Yes
It took long to get to the game boards to .... It took long to get to the game boards to play.† Too many how too instructions in between games.† I already stopped playing it.,Yes

fun game. The only problem I have with this game is the darkened game .† It always get stuck at the bottom of the game.,Yes
"Purchases Disappear. Although the game is fun, beware of this developer! First, I tried to purchase ""jewels"" in order to extend my play and ended up spending over $ 20 because the purchases were never confirmed so I believed they didn't go through.† That left me with 350 jewels to play. When I stopped the game, I had over 300 left.† The next day, that number was 15. I thought I was mistaken about the number so† I purchased a ""package"" that included at least 60 jewels before I shut the game down thinking I would play today.† When I opened the game, there were only 5 jewels remaining and that's because of the daily ""bonus"" of 5 jewels.† This game is a money trap.† I have learned my lesson and will not download any other games from this developer!!",Yes
"Doesn't work. Showed a gear icon that appeared to be settings that would allow turning off or at least lowering the volume on the nauseating music, but seemed to be locked into a tutorial mode because nothing happened when the icon was clicked. After several minutes of frustration trying to get it to work, I uninstalled.",Yes
"Waste of Money. I love playing the game but when I purchase crystals this company never sends me the items that I purchase in a timely manner. I purchase items to help win the level that I'm on. I have to contact support via email, which can take days for a response. I am basically wasting money playing this game due to I can never get the items I purchased sent to me IMMEDIATELY† ""while on the level I'm needing it on, without sending a screenshot to customer service. TIME TO DELETE THIS GAME!!!",Yes
??. frustrating that it started me all over again when I got a new tablet. Now I can't make any progress. I especially can't ever win a game when I get the infinity symbol. At this rate It is becoming boring and I will never get back to my previous level.,Yes
"I am not happy with this issue.. As of today 8/8/2018, I am still having problems with this app. I have contacted same about this and have received nothing. I just purchased a starter pack from Amazon for this game. I played a few games this morning, went to another screen and now I can't get into the app. This is the only app this is happening to. I go to the icon and click, it brings up same cover page for a few seconds and then goes black. I have lost all my activity and gems and lives for this game.",Yes
"fun but frustating. I very much enjoy this game because I have been able to learn while playing, it is challenging, the graphics are beautiful.† HOWEVER, it is also extremely frustating.† I have 2 collections I cannot complete and have been trying for almost three weeks to get the missing chargers.† Even when I manage to complete a challenging level, I get a couple of energy points, nothing substantial.† Seriously annoying.† Oh, and by the way, if you are giving energy points as prizes, considering how quickly energy is used up (as noted in numerous comments here) you could at least make it a larger number.† I also find it very annoying that when I am stuck and unable to clear any of the current quests, no more are made available.† In one of my other games, quests are added regularly, allowing me to go to something new and come back to the older quests.† This would help eliminate the frustration of trying the same game over and over again.† As I have a limited income, I am not free to spend money on crystals which makes it extremely difficult to make any progress.† I will continue playing as I do enjoy the game and the challenges, but I don't know how much longer, due to the high frustration level",Yes
Slowwwww progress through the game. The game is too slow moving. I like to work toward goals but this is too frustrating.† You can only play about 6 times (win or lose) before lives are gone.† I can't seem to play for long before I have to leave it and wait to play again.,Yes
"Waste of time.... I would have given it 0 stars if I could. I downloaded it, tried to play it & there were so many interruptions from figures on the screen that it took forever to get anywhere in the game. I deleted it from my device.",Yes
Horrible. When u make a video u can't hear your voice.,Yes
"I don't get it.... This app is not good. When I choose the animal, it doesn't work so that's a ONE from me!",Yes
"Donít waste your money!!!!!!. So my 4 yr old bought this game without my knowledge ??????? Bad mom for forgetting to setup the parental controls on his new tablet! Anywho, this game is crap! It lags so bad that itís not even worth playing!!!! I wish I could just get my $14.99 back ?? If I could give it zero stars I would!",Yes
"Didn't Work. We paid all this money to download, then the game glitched the whole time and we were unable to play.† Very frustrating.",Yes
Doesn't work. Won't go past vehicleSelect screen.,Yes
It won't load.... For some reason when I first get on the app it says the chapters can't connect to the wifi. Plz fix this :-(,Yes
"I can't save my progress, would have given 0 stars. I will not support a game where there is no way for me to save my progress. I can only play this on this phone. I can't play on my ASUS Pad. I should be able to play on other device and I can't.",Yes
Error. The app hasn't worked for at least 2 days now. Really disheartening. Error message says app can't connect to server.,Yes
Meh.... The app is kinda boring but kinda fun at the same time. It really bother me how you don't start of with any money or gems and if you want any it is $5-$100!??,Yes
"Great game but has some errors. I am so addicted to these story's but there are some problems with it, starting off i always get an error message which really drives me crazy. Also, everything costs so much money. How my biggest problem is that I read about 11 stories already, and it was fine, but about 5 or them only have me 1 gem of or 10, but it never gave them to me. So I have 15 gems when I should have at least 60...",Yes
Waste of time. The game doesn't even work. So annoying.,Yes
"Missing info. While reading a chapter, anytime the characters text i can't see it. So I am missing about a quarter of the story. Also, it takes FOREVER to read the next chapter. And, there is no way to earn diamonds to make choices. You have to buy them. There should be a way to earn them.",Yes
"I'm starting to hate CrazyMaple Studio. It's a fun game, don't get me wrong! But it has problems. I can only play it for like, two days before I have to delete it and re-install it 5 times. The storieS are great, but please fix this problem so I play!",Yes
Problems with Chapters. Chapters:Interactive game will get stuck and does not work,Yes
Can't play. Crashes repeatedly before even getting to actual game play.,Yes
"Glitch. Blotchy I can't even set up my character name, it keeps closing. Giving it two thumbs down for this app on Amazon appstore. I use the same app on my Android phone and it works great, but horrible on Amazon tablet",Yes
"Keep your money, but make some friends. Like everyone has already put, money is a huge deal. There is no give if you can't spend money on it. You need to keep up with the gear, VIP level, commander level or you will not survive unless you plan on shielding and not doing what the game is meant for which makes it boring. They need parameters for base levels so some one who has put $1000 in can't hit someone who hasn't put a dime in it. And yes it can cost more then that to keep up. Can meet good people on the game and establish friendships for boring days. Two stars for conversation, 1 star for graphics, 0 for playability if you are on a strict money budget.",Yes
Not like you see on tv lags really bad kicks you .... Not like you see on tv lags really bad kicks you out of game a lot and bigger players keep you down so you can't grow,Yes
"Terrible company, often you will not get what is advertised with in-app purchases, one email per day per issue. I wish we could give negative stars. Frustrating frustrating frustrating, did I mention frustrating, zero customer service.Pros:Could be fun if it worked right and you got your money 's worthCons:1. The game never works right. Also if you think you are playing for free, forget about it, this game is not fun at all unless you spend money, otherwise you are constantly losing battles. Been there tried that, not fun at all.2. 80% of the time you don't get what you paid for. Example, you buy a pack that is $99 and comes with few different types of of upgrade, lets call them A, B and C. So you paid $99 to get upgrade A, upgrade B, Upgrade C. Fantastic you are all happy now to use the upgrade and make your moves, 1 problem, for some reason when you go to apply upgrade C, you get an error. Ok contact customer service right? Read #33. Contacting customer service = you send an email for help, you immediately get a programed response saying their team is viewing your claim, then you wait 24 to 48 hours for response. When they do respond it is always the same:A. If your issues is the game giving you an error or something not working right, then you are told ""programmers are aware and are working on it. (sure, I have been waiting for over a year for the programmers to fix my errors and nothing, meanwhile they have my money for the issue that is not working)B. If your issue is you didn't get the correct amount of something then they will keep incorrectly telling you that you are the one that is mistaken and you did get the correct amount,† even tho after the first 3 times you have learned your lesson and this time you have screen shots as proof.(see my first picture about credits, at the bottom you see link for 6 screnshots as proof, still didn't get my 3 million† credits till this day, now it is obsolete)4. One email per day. After waiting 24 to 48 hours (mostly 48 or longer) you get a response back from† customer service if you are lucky, and you respond, you now have to wait 24 hours for a response, in short your communication is limited to one email per day making every issue a week long project.5. Don't expect them to read your emails, example last week I like an idiot decided to come back to this game, paid for upgrade pack, part of it was something called ""instant multiple research"". What this does is allows you to upgrade bunch of categories with one click instead of literally 100s of clicks. Emailed customer service complaining about ""instant multiple research"" not working, 2 days later got a response saying we understand you have an issue with ""alliance gifts"" we are working on it. Now ""alliance gifts"" have nothing to do with ""instant multiple research"" so obviously they didn't read my email at all.That is like you call AT&T to complain about your ""cellphone service"" and they say: we understand you are having an issue with your"" tivo box"" and we are working on it.That was last week, replied to them saying their response had nothing to do with my issue, you want to know what their response is?I will let you know when they respond because 7 days and 5 emails later, I have 0 response to report to you. This is Machine Zone's idea of customer service.6. No way to contact this company other than the process above, which basically means no way of contacting this company. Mobile Strike, gods of War and a couple of other games are owned by machine zone.STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME / COMPANY, THEIR FINE PRINT SAYS YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS AND THEY ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO HAVE THE GAME WORKING PROPERLY OR OWE YOU ANYTHING AT ALL WHETHER ITS THE GAME WORKING† CORRECTLY, YOU GETTING WHAT YOU PAID FOR IN-APP PURCHASES. CUSTOMER SATISFACTION MEANS ZERO TO THIS COMPANY, I WARNED YOU.LOOK AT ALL THE OTHER NEGATIVE REVIEWS HERE AND EVERY PLACE ELSE, ALSO GOOGLE ""MOBILE STRIKE COMPLAINT"".",Yes

"Bullies ruin it unless you spend lots of cash. Played this game for about a week and a half, managed to get a level 10 base without spending any real money. Got attacked over and over again by someone with a power rating of 5 million compared to my 189k. You can't teleport your base without spending real money so I uninstalled after the third time this jerk raided my base. Don't waste your time with this game. You will absolutely be frustrated with it eventually unless you sink some serious cash into it.",Yes
"WORST game in history!. I wish I could give this game zero stars but unfortunately that's not an option here. The game crashes all the time and when it wants to work there's always an issue with lag and never ending loading errors. Gold packs are deceptive and don't give you the items advertised. Product support is essentially nonexistent, 5 days now and no response besides the automated email when i first opened the tickets. Save yourself a headache and stay AWAY from this game!",Yes
"Where's the action? Where's the thinking?. The gamer is led by the hand in the early parts to build oil, research, and other facilities. You are told what to do and click. Boring.",Yes
Don't waste your time or money. This game is 100% pay to win.....if you can't spend 500 a month on this game then don't bother playing...ads are constantly popping up....packs they sell keep getting bigger and bigger to attract buyers...waste of time,Yes
don't do it. don't waste your time. glitchy,Yes

Don't. don't waste your time,Yes
Two Stars. too expensive.... can't keep up,Yes
Very addictive game. Have to spend money or you .... Very addictive game.† Have to spend money or you will never be able to grow very much.† Very big issue in the game is that some people spend extreme amounts of money and will always be larger than others.† These players can always wipe you out in a second and does make game seem overrated and you could spend $100 or more to loose everything in 2 seconds.,Yes
Waste of time. Game is crap.† Lags and crashes constantly.† The only way to have fun is by spending hundreds of dollars and then it becomes a trap.† If you dont have money to blow and hours of time per day to play its a waste of time.,Yes
Game is to hard to set up. To hard to get the hang of it i tryed for about a month and went no where and no instructions to speak of i hated it. Dont waste your money unless you like guessing,Yes
"BAD. I've had the game for about 4 minutes now and MY GOD IS IT SLOW. You would not believe how slow this game is. I can't get anything done in a reasonable amount of time. In fact, this game is so slow that the only times that I have actually closed the game are when the game is so slow that it (my device) tells me that Mobile Strike is not responding. The only reason that I have given this game a star is because you HAVE to give a game a star when giving it a review. DO NOT GET THIS GAME.",Yes
"Keep your cash. Just another ""spend your money "" game. I played the ancestors of all these multi-player games, Civony and Evony. I know some players who spent more than a thousand dollars, $30 at a time.† That is crazy. I† will mess around until I can't go any more without spending money. Then I will uninstall.",Yes
I would not know I downloaded it and was unable .... I would not know I downloaded it and was unable to play it on my fire,Yes
"Not fun unless you keep spending. The game keeps pushing upgrades and boosts on you every minute you play. Not only that, once you pay for a kit, they raise the price and keep doing it without offering it at the same price ever again. And if you don't spend any money then you can't really compete and are just there to be defeated and lose all your progress. Not worth your money or your time.",Yes
waste of time. It is a game of war ripoff and scams you into buying stuff if I could I would give this game one sixth of a star because you can chat,Yes
"Let ME Play The Game!. I love the game, but there's one problem... I am really bothered by their constant interruptions (by pointing to what they want me to do)!!",Yes
"it is addictive in a bad way because you think you are making progress in .... other reviews right on. it's a money grab and you cannot compete or play without paying thousands. the game is not an action game. they simply ask you for a hundred bucks every time you log on to complete endless research which becomes obsolete within a week..the commercials are right, it is addictive in a bad way† because you think you are making progress in this scam but you can't. also you can lose the money you just spent instantly by getting destroyed by bigger bases...makes it gambling, not gaming.",Yes
"this is a great game!!!. I've tried BMC before, and it still doesn't amount to this! but I've rated this 4 stars because it keeps crashing on me to the point where I don't want to play it. fix this, and I will change it to 5 stars. it would be grateful both for me, and the others who are experiencing this problem too.",Yes
"Like the game somewhat. Like the game somewhat, however, VERY geared towards $$$$$$ players.† In the end, what do you actually get but an empty pocket or credit card bill.† You can't hope to establish a base as you're bullied by larger players levels >15 as they attack your troops on resource tile gathering missions just to get ""kill"" points/power.† Not sure how anyone expected to think beginners could fair against a larger player/s, alliances I've seen are no help either.† L1 troops lose against >L4 or along those lines.† Lower players can't really attack higher players to gain anything, only be suicide.† $5 pack is an OK deal, not purchased one myself but they just go up up up after that as a baiting mechanism to make you buy buy buy.† Been playing actively for months and never have I gotten anything significant to advance to stronger levels.† Larger players swarm around you waiting for your peace shield to drop so they can attack your base, with a peace shield you can't be attacked or attack someone else or scout either.† Material to manufacture things is none existent, you have to run so many resource tiles and combine items to barely make a weapon for your commander.† And, DON'T EVER occupy a resource tile >6 as that's a beacon to larger players to just kill your troops if they can't defend off the attack.",Yes
You can't be successful in this game unless you constantly poor money into the game. Consumes your time and constantly demands you to spend money on upgrades. You can't be successful in this game unless you constantly poor money into the game.† There for it wasn't fun after a while.† I don't recommend this to anyone.,Yes
It worked poorly. It worked very poorly and frequently just stopped.† It did not show all the chefs and repeatedly got stuck.† So it is gone.,Yes
"kindle fire issues. My previously working food network app, stops working every time I open it!† Very annoying if I want to look in my recipe box, or look up new recipes.† Thanks for nothing, food network.",Yes

Was unable to watch.. I couldnít watch it. The videos were fuzzy and distorted.,Yes
Wish it would work. Unable to get the free one year with Prime. Each time I put in my password thereís an error,Yes

App doesnt work. The app doesn't work.† I would not waste my time. The app refuses to open on Kindle and it not worth the effort.,Yes
I've cut the cable cord. Unable to use as they want me to sign in with my cable provider account to view some content.† Oh well.† Another APP i cant use for streaming,Yes
Worked one time. This app is worthless.† It worked the first time I set it up and has not loaded since.† So called free subscription will cost you a year from now if you don't go in and turn off auto renewal on your Amazon account whether you can use it or not.† Wife so excited to have this but now it causes her to hate the whole Fire Stick.† It puts a spinning white circle on the screen but never brings up the app.† Why can't they fix this problem?,Yes

"good app but few issues. i like having recipes on my tablet organized. has problems importing recipes from some websites, have to spend time manually cutting and pasting together and adding pictures",Yes
Don't bother!. Don't bother! I spent three days trying to get this app to work! What a waste of time!,Yes
very annoying. When I first got this app I completely loved now its absolutely annoying every time I go in it says it needs an update it will not allow me to access anything unless I update itwhen I go to the app store to update it it doesn't show that there is an update available so now I have absolutely no access to my recipes and I can't add anything please fix it,Yes
chieftap recipe app. This app is basically impossible to use. It must be for storing recipes that are on another device. I was unable to find recipes or enter anything that brought up any recipes.,Yes
"I registered by inputting my email address & need to .... I registered by inputting my email address & need to confirm my email to start using the app. Unfortunately I haven't received the email to confirm so I can't use the app (yes, I've checked junk mail too). Tried to reregister but it won't let me. App won't let me do anything til I confirm an email I haven't received, so it's pants.",Yes
"It's annoying with it's tutorials throughout. You can only play for 5 minutes before it asks you to pay if you want to play more... not worth the free version. Buy it? No, not worth that either. It's annoying with it's tutorials throughout. And you can't turn off the noise either.",Yes
Helps are WAY to overpriced!!. Can't get far without helps that are WAY too costly!† I mean who pays $40 and up for a few added helps,Yes
"Annoyed with this game. I would love this game if it didn't take months of playing the same puzzle multiple times a day until out of energy each time and still never getting that quest piece let alone any of those other little things needed to complete a collection to progress the game.† I would love to love this game but all it does is make me bored or frustrated.† I've completed the puzzle at least 200 times now.† Why no quest piece??????2021 update:† After not playing for a while I decided to pick it up again.† There is nothing to do past level 16 besides play the same boring frustrating puzzles over and over.† I need 8000 to get to the next level and each puzzle is 100 exp.† In other words its going to take forever to even progress.† That is the only way to progress by the way because you simply cannot get any of the ""rare"" items that complete a construction.† I have played so many times for just one item and it never shows up.† Not once after years of playing.† The only way to progress is to buy the item with real money and its not like its a dollar.† More like $20.",Yes
A lot of fun but.... I'm having problems when I try to click on buttons to play the game. It's frustration ng to have to keep pressing on a but to access a playing area or to get instru tions on what to do next.,Yes
Froze up on me.. I would have like to played it a little longer but I started having problem in the middle of moves. The game would slow up and then knock me completely out of the system. Got to frustrated,Yes
"Fun treasure hunt game. Fun game with cool graphics and quests. Only two complaints: sometimes when trying to find a required item you can complete the level it's supposed to be on a dozen times in a row and still not find it, which moves the game from challenging and fun to frustrating and no fun. Also, I hate hate hate faded mode, where the colors are faded from the pieces. My eyes aren't as good as they used to be and it's really hard to differentiate the pieces by shape alone.Otherwise, a really fun game.",Yes
good enough entertainment when it works. Can't open the game since the new update was downloaded!!! Frustrated.,Yes
Good Game but...... Good Game but needs lots of improvements. Main issue is the connect to facebook feature. This section is not working. It always has the loading circle spinning and nothing happens. Not sure if you can save your data and reload game on new device. Most other facebook connected games let you do this automatically. I already had to start over once because of tablet death. I probably would spend some money on this game if transferable data to a new device was an option. But as of now it's pointless to buy upgrades if you can't save gameplay.† Other issues were constant freezing.,Yes
Hard to Read. It is very hard to read and you cannot zoom to make it better. Game seems OK but small print and no zoom make it no fun. Thanks,Yes
"Not sure about this one.. I like the game. I'm a match 3 game fan. I liked some of the other games by Phyton,† The problem I have with this game, is it's slow to respond to taps, too much lag time after you tap. Then you tap again, and you miss things and the next job has popped up,,it gets frustrating, because it doesn't allow me to look things over to see what objects do, or to get info.. I'll give it a little more time, it might improve as I go, as it could just be I'm doing something wrong.",Yes
"Cracked of Empire. I do enjoy this game but encounter frequent technical issues.† Although I have followed instructions as given and using a fast Internet connection as well as signed into Face Book editing my preference to share as directed, I constantly get slow or no Internet connection messages.† Recently when I opened the app to play, I discovered my friends list as disappeared.† I clear the cache and shut down my device when not playing.I will continue to play but will not be adding friends.",Yes
"limited game play unless you buy ""energy"" Too bad. Decent game but very transparent in effort to get you to spend real $. Constant ""sales"" and ""offers"", limited game play unless† you buy ""energy"" Too bad",Yes
Waste of time. Too much nonsense going on that interferes with the actual game.† Waste of time.,Yes
"Fun game. This is a fun game not too hard and not too easy. I enjoy it for passing the time. Just recently however I downloaded an update and now can't get to the game. So if you aren't using a new generation watch out it will probably do the same. I still like the game, but now I can't play it without probably having to take it off and download again, which isn't happening gone to far into game to start over.",Yes
"Some annoying issues. Here are some bad things about this game:1.† The amount of energy to play the puzzles is too high.† I can go thru 100 energy in less than 30 min. easily.† Then wait for hours for it to build up again only to play 3 or 4 puzzles before it runs out again. COME ON MAN!2.† Why is it SOOOO SOOOO hard for the appropriate items or chargers needed for quests to drop?† Example, During the Chocolate Day Event, after spending over 500 energy (over† 2 days worth of playing) I only had 1 recipe finished.† COME ON MAN!3. Having played the game for almost a month and getting over 525 collection items and over 200 chargers (yes I counted them all), I only have 19 collections finished.† That's not even 20.† I've wasted a whole lot of TIME and ENERGY only receive items and some chargers that I DO NOT need.† COME ON MAN!I don't know if y'all designed the game this way, but it needs to change.Here are some suggestions:1.† Reduce the energy cost on the puzzles or increase energy regeneration so that players can play for a little bit longer.2. Please make it easier for quest items and chargers to drop.† Those Magic and Lucky Charm spells (at least for me) didn't help me at all.3. The events have to last a little bit longer.† There needs to be a better chance of getting the reward.4. Increase the time on some of these timed puzzles.† Some of these puzzles are very difficult, having to do them in under a minute and a half is just insane.I like this style of match-3, clear the tiles type of play.† It's a challenging game, that is why I give it this rating.",Yes
"Frustrating instead of entertaining. Have to play the same puzzles over and over again in search of items you never get to make collections.† Can quickly become a money pit of you allow it, so beware.† It becomes boring to listen to the same old music and do the same level and never complete collections and tasks.† Done with it.",Yes
One Star. Game doesn't work,Yes
"Game did not work. I finished the first round and when I got to the second round, it would not proceed.There were no instructions to show me how to fix this problem.",Yes
Hard to Find Items. It's a good game and you can tell the did developers put in a lot of effort. My biggest complaint is you'll play a level to complete a task and you won't find the item you need. If you play this game just be aware that you'll play the same level over and over and over and over and over again. And it's obnoxious especially because they only give you extremely limited energy to play the levels in the first place. It's annoying enough that I'm considering maybe deleting the game.,Yes
So close to max stars. Almost max stars but energy is too small and too slow to regen that you can't get into the game.,Yes
Horrible. Slow...didn't take long before wanted money to keep playing....can't afford this??,Yes
after I spent cash game continuously crashes now...so now I wasted money for a game I can't play. Bought the starter pack and then the game started crashing in the middle of levels. Guess I'll play the next game longer than a day before I spend money!!!!!,Yes
"I will always move on before I pay a recurring fee to play a game.. Not a bad match three game upfront, but the game becomes increasingly unfriendly as you progress.† As you build the different parts of the town (farm, pottery, etc.), you can't upgrade them until you reach a certain level.† So now I have completed all the available boards - Hut, Farm, Sepat and Pottery, and am halfway through level 18.† I can't level up until I reach level 20 for Pottery, 22 for Hut, 25 for Sepat and 26 for Farm.My only choices for progress are to replay completed levels for days or (I assume) spend jewels.† Add me to the list of customers who would much rather pay an upfront fee, or a purchase fee once I learn the game, rather than have companies try to nickel and dime me.FACE IT, DEVELOPERS!† I have numerous options to play other games and will continue to delete these types of stacked games and move on to something new.† The only way you will get any money from me is to change the way you bill for playing.† A one time fee is the only way you will ever see my money.People, if you want a fun Match 3 game that can be played indefinitely without spending a dime, get Gummy Drop.† It can be done!",Yes
"upset a d frustrated. I have been trying to access cradle of empires for the past week. I thought it needed updating........but NO!!!!! I have removed it and reinstalled, turned off device, looked for updates......nothing.Is there a reason this is happening that I don't know about?It seems other players are having the same problem.",Yes
Where'smy purchase?. I enjoy the game and the building. I play almost every day on my Amazon Fire tablet. Along with other games it keeps having problems finding the Amazon Appstore App and kicks me out. I end up running the app before any game and it still has problems. An error screen comes on quite often but doesn't affect the play. Still waiting for an order of† Special Discount Pack 5 to show on game.,Yes
cradle slot. boring. dropped app,Yes
Slow response with touch. The slow response to my touch makes this game frustrating. I have to touch an object then wait for the game to respond. No other games I play takes so long to respond to a touch command. Fix this one issue and this would be a great game to play.,Yes
Drop rate slow. Fun but collecting items take a long time... almost to the point of frustration,Yes
annoying. I am frustrated with this game. It keeps popping up when I do web searches. I accepted but the pop ups continued so I removed it. Please solve this problem...annoying,Yes
"One Star. Boring repetative, the tutorial wouldn't stop.",Yes
"It's no good if it doesn't work.. The app doesn't work!† I have deleted, then reinstalled it twice.† It still looks like it would be fun, and perhaps it is, but not on my Kindle Fire.",Yes
Frustrated.... I really enjoy playing this game but the problem that I encountered was I needed to update it and it wouldn't allow it it kept failing and I had to uninstall and reinstall and start over at the very very beginning and that really sucked! There should be away to keep your progress when it's connected to Facebook.,Yes
Fun game but can't use settings. I† love the game but I can't click on the settings icon. I'm stuck having to click on the next task. I would like to remove the music on the game but I can't.,Yes
"Boring and slow. The game looked interesting, so I tried it. I am simply bored with games with a plot line that takes forever to work out. Yes, a considerable amount of time is spent in the early rounds explaining how things work. but most of the explanations don't make sense and the acts are more or less intuitive. I also dislike games that require a cash investment in order to continue. When I ran out of energy, I deleted the game.",Yes
"SoSo. A bit boring, same as all three match games.",Yes
Complaint. Only complaint iisCoin purchasing† never download promptly which is a problem when in the middle of a game,Yes
"Too slow, boring story, can't just play game without story. Uuggghh, I just wanted to play the match-3 game without having to read the story. It's a dumb, very slow moving story. Uninstalled.",Yes
"Challenging and Unique - WHOOPS!† NOT SO FAST.† EDITED AND AMENDED REVIEW.. WARNING ABOUT GAME UPDATE:† So, after my review earlier today, I updated my game from the app store.† Immediately it became impossible to play the game.† It kept freezing and freezing and freezing.† You shouldn't UPDATE the game.† Apparently updating will screw up the game play.I tried everything to fix the problem.† I closed and opened the game.† I powered off the Kindle and restarted it.† Finally, I stupidly uninstalled and reinstalled the game.† This works with Panda Pop, because the info shares from Facebook.† But, I should have known, that didn't work for this game.† I ended up at the beginning again, losing all progress.I AM UNINSTALLING THE GAME.† I DON'T HAVE TIME TO PLAY GAMES THAT ARE GLITCHED.† And, I take back my earlier statement, ""This game is lots of fun with many challenging levels and a unique back story.† If people like match three games with a twist, this is the game for them.""† The game IS fun, and I like a challenge, but I don't want to have to deal with customer service people every time I update a game.† So, be aware that updates may screw you up.† Good luck to all you other players, but I'm out of here.",Yes
"Boring and inane. This kept coming up as an ad while playing spider solitaire. Thought it might be interesting, wrong! It spends so much time doing inane thinvs on the screen, and without telling you why, that you quickly get tired of plsying along and not actually playing.",Yes
"don't make me pay. Why can't you get a game that doesn't make you pay for lives? Fun game but I have to set it down to regenerate live or power. I'm NOT buying stuff but I WOULD buy the game,",Yes
"if ur bored. This is a cute game. It's like they put a couple of games that are similar to very popular games like candy crush and a popular game that u complete quests(idk a name off hand) together into one. So if ur bored this can waste a lot of time, until u run out of energy. I very much dislike games that have the energy thing. I will play them for a few days until it gets to where I can't play it but for a few minutes because my energy is gone. I then I delete it. So that's why I gave 3 stars. Get rid of that ridiculous energy stuff so we can play for however long we want, please! Then u will get 5 stars.",Yes
"Good game. Really enjoy the game, the only thing that† is a problem to me is that it will stop and close out where you have to reopen the game.",Yes
"Hate the Way You Cannot Move at Times. Too often, I waste time trying to make my next move.† This is especially ridiculous on timed games.† First, I have to wait to move, and that includes even when I attempt your selection.† Then, when I can finally select a square, the game moves it where it wants, not allowing me to make a move.† You can make suggestions, but they shouldn't keep me from moving and you should NEVER, EVER override my† choices!† This has stopped me from progressing as I see no way to handle timed mode as you† control the board.† I am playing the Kindle version.† Other version s may be more honest.",Yes
fun but.... Keeps freezing up and it is NOT because it is -9 outside. Upsetting. Other re Jews talk about how much the game cost (hidden or otherwise) but I can't get that far.,Yes
Load yrouble. Fun challenge game but it keeps saying there's an interval problem & causing problems to play,Yes
No fun with this app. I hated it every move u make u have to read what they want u to do next .. boring i deleted if of my device,Yes
Frustrating. You'll play the same board dozens of times before you get the item you need. I played one board 12 times. Rapidly gets boring and annoying. I'm removing it.,Yes
Don't waste your time!. It was hard to play and locked up constantly.† I removed it within an hour.,Yes
looping problem. I was enjoying the game and had reached the pottery second level on level 12 as I started playing the 1st game after finishing the level it would kick me out of game to main screen. After 20 tries I gave up and reloaded since it always went back to previous game played. Now I. Have to start all over. The game is fun but a little slow between screen changes,Yes
Ok. Fun game but frustrating when you complete a task but don't receive reward?! Ask to play for one reward but even with multiple completions still can't get reward!,Yes
slow pace. Pace is too slow. Will become boring.,Yes
"UNFAIR. This is a fun game and the graphics are great, but don't expect to earn things fairly through play.† You are set up to fail unless you purchase items to complete collections. I've been playing daily for months, yet I still have 18 incomplete collections that have been sitting for months due to my inability to find the missing items needed to complete. Why??? Like I said,† I play daily. No reason for that. Additionally, the ""add friends"" feature doesn't work. With other games, you can trade items with friends to complete collections, give gifts, etc. The same features is said to be available in this game but it's inconveniently unavailable so you will be incented to purchase items instead of earning them fairly through play.† Since I've stuck around so long, clearly I'm a little addicted, but it's time to delete this app.",Yes
"My favorite game. I really enjoy playing the game but some things are too hard to find. I believe the lives should restore faster. Amazon needs to hurry and update the game also. I can't do half the things I need to do now. I just hope this comment will speed up the process on upgrading the app itself. I really don't have much else to say about the app but it has to be a certain length to submit which I think is very dumb. How long do you really think a comment on a review should be, nobody is going to want a whole paragraph about a game honestly.",Yes
"Awful.. Awful.. Awful.. Awful on the Kindle HD.† I had to tap 24 times to enter one level, finish the level then tap 17 times on the settings to turn off the volume. I give up and try Another level with an even 20 taps, finish the level then tap .. well, you get the idea. I deleted the game only to find out that I can't review the game unless it's loaded. So I reload, try the game again. What a disaster.",Yes
"Not impressed. I just bought a new Kindle and thought I'd try a new game. While the Kindle doesn't have any problems with other games, it is very slow with this game. Tapping on a dialogue box or selecting an item is often an exercise in futility. I could tap until the cows come home, but nothing will happen. How frustrating it is.",Yes
"I am not paying money for any of these games. the game is Ok. but I don't like to buy, coins to continue with the game. so I stopped playing it.",Yes
"A bit tedious when the game. After each screen of breaking tiles the game goes back to the same pyramid screen which reloads before returning to the main game screen.† I find this pyramid screen boring and tedious.† Otherwise, game is somewhat interesting but heaven knows what finally happens when you gather the many unknown items",Yes
unable to play with it. I am about to delete it because I cannot use it. Whenever I try to start playing the nomad appears with instructions and the whole process gets stuck and it is impossible to continue any further.,Yes
I can't seem to find a menu on this game .... I can't seem to find a menu on this game and it is very hard to exit.† I had to turn off my phone to get out of it.,Yes
waste of brain cells. another time waster.,Yes
Horrible. Updated app and I can't make a call.,Yes
"Horrible Update. Skype, for Kindle hd, was okay before recent update.† After update, multi-tasking is non existent, there is no volume control and calls constantly drop.† I wish there was an option to go back to the previous update.† Please stop back tracking, Skype, and fix these issues.",Yes
can't even connect. Since last update I haven't gotten a single call to connect,Yes
"Kindle Fire HD 8.9- AWFUL. I have never had problems with Skype until using this app. Random shut downs on mine and my husband's end (ipad 2), freezing, and blackout/muted moments. I was excited to be able to talk to my husband who is over seas but Skype makes it so frustraing and at times impossible to video or even simply to voice chat. I thought maybe it was the distance but have tried local with just as many problems. I wish there was a solid alternative.",Yes
"it does not connect. I bought the kindle because of skype. I tried several times to skype with my grandson. Then went to skype Faq Forum.† Guess there are hundreds of people with the same issues. call does not go thru, hangs up, no pic or no sound. Pleaze fix this app.",Yes
Worst update. Ever since I got this update when I open the app my kindle has shut down and turned back on and glitches. I can't open the video camera. PLEASE FIX!!!,Yes
I don't get this. I love using the app but I hate that I can't make Skype go into vertical and not horizontal. It's very annoying when I'm typing on the messenger I have to hold the kindle with one handed then type with the other. It gets very annoying after awhile. Whoever reads this and has had this problem and found a fix please tell me how to fix it.,Yes
no sound. I can hardly hear any sound from other end. It's useless to use and frustrating. Please fix this issue and I will give 5 star.,Yes
"oh goodness problems. For my kindle HD, it doesn't work properly. Seriously. I hate that I can't rotate the screen, and something is wrong with the keyboard every time pops up to type.",Yes
"Protect yourself, Skype sure will not..... Do not expect Skype to protect you if the app does not work properly. Take care to pay for Skype services with an active credit card that handles disputes professionally. DO NOT use PayPal or bank account debits.Last March, I downloaded an app release by Skype for my Windows Phone. It did not work. Skype initially denied the existence of such an app. Finally, it acknowledged that it did not work properly.PayPal said my payment covered a service and not refundable. Skype ignored repeated request using email (no phone for a telephony provider?)Just today, pursuing use for my Kindle Fire, I found that my initial deposit was forfeit for inactivity. I used chat to request reinstatement. The representative seemed unable to extract information despite a ""Dick & Jane"" narrative, asking off-base questions and even, well into the conversation, requesting my screen name -- provided on the transcript.

"please for the love of god don't use this app.. I've had my kindle fire hd for around a year now and the skype app has always been terrible.

"No group video chat with Kindle Fire HD and Skype.... I am giving this app 1 measly star because I can't give it 0 stars. I have been reading online and it appears Amazon/Skype has removed the group video chat capability of Skype with Kindle. I recently signed up for Skype Premium so I could group chat with my sons who live in different states. They both have Kindle Fire HD's. What a waste of $10?! At least I didn't pay for the whole year up front, I guess. Many of the reviews about Skype I have read were posted by folds who signed up for the entire year! After about 30 minutes of trying and having various issues, we gave up and I started doing some researching. We also had various other issues with Skype when trying to video chat one-on-one. Everything from the video freezing, dropping calls, slow video, and the app crashing. I will not be renewing my Skype membership unless this issue is fixed ASAP.",Yes
Doesn't work!!!!!!!!!. I can't see the other person I wasted like a day setting it up and I don't is† it ever don't waste your time on this,Yes
"Why is the volume so low?. I have the volume on max and the in call volume with just the kindle, as well as a headset is terrible. Is there some trick to turn it up?

"Doesn't even deserve a star.. Why does this app still not work? I have the fourth generation Kindle Fire HD 6 and this app does not work. It doesn't connect calls at all! It fails the call, every single time I make a call. I have seriously reconsidered whether or not I should return my Kindle Fire HD 6 or just unsubscribe to Skype. I have paid for my phone number with Skype for years.

I hate this. The calls not connecting. And when it do connect I can't see my son. He can see me but I can't see him. I hate this app,Yes
"Hard to Install and Use. I found this app hard to install and then it was hard to figure out how to use.† It wouldn't install for me the first time.† I tried later and it worked.† Don't know why it didn't work the first time.† My cousin was at my house and she called me and we talked to each other for about a minute.† We didn't really think it was something that we would use since you have to notify the person you want to ""talk"" to ahead of time so that they pick up when you call.† I tried to install it on my other cousins new Kindle Fire and she couldn't get the app to install either.† Same problem I had the first time.† She decided she didn't want it so we didn't try again.",Yes
"Don't bother trying, the app just doesn't work. I thought I could outsmart the plethora of negative reviews, especially since Skype is a well known platform.† I failed, I was able to log in but that was it. The app immediately crashed to a black screen and never returned.",Yes
it was really hard to find in on my kindle .... it was really hard to find in on my kindle and when I finally did i can't hear the person on the other end,Yes
"Not too bad on Kindle Fire Hd 8. Not too bad on Kindle Fire Hd 8. The only problem I had, that lead to a 3 star rating, was freezing and buffering.",Yes

Poor. Can't navigate use facetime instead,Yes
Two Stars. I did not find it at all user friendly.† I was unable to get through.,Yes
Unable to sign-in???. I'm surprised to see a lot of negative comments about the updated Skype. I thought I am the only one having trouble with it. I had been trying to login with my credentials and Skype simply keeps on promptinh me with &#34;Unable to sign in.&#34; How horrible it is! I don't know how to fix it. :(,Yes
Skype. I am unable to download and use Skype with my Kindle Fire.† I was told it is because there is not a camera on my Kindle so it won't let me use it.,Yes
Skype on Fire issue with incoming calls. The app listens to the incoming calls only when it is open Iand is in foreground. On other platforms Skype is always on when device is powered on. This needs to be fixed on Fire.,Yes
"Translation function. Voice translation tool is very temperamental, in addition to which I have been unable to identify how to activate any translation function via my tablet Skype app at all .....",Yes
"Very glitchy.. I'm sorry I'm having to post this to you, but I want to get this off my chest, this Skype is the worst one I'm using, it is so glitchy, calls would last for 1 second, a lot of messages would appear in random places I'm not sure what's going on, my friend is also having a lot of problems with your app too where when she makes a call it starts flashing black on her phone she's even told me that you haven't responded to her messages. ( btw Skype calls wouldn't last a second for me I forgot to put it there, but for some reason I can't go back to fix it. ) I think you guys might need to fix these problems on your app. I'm not saying your app isn't all that bad because I get to make more groups and do a bit more stuff than others, and I do think this app will have a lot of potential there's just a lot of stuff that needs to be fixed badly. I still do use it, but its the only thing I can use for right now.",Yes
Doesn't work!. This does not work on Kindle at all. Complete waste of time. I do not suggest this download. Research the download before downloading.,Yes
"Not cool. It had me do my email, and NOT a cool name! I would use of to facetime my friend Halle... But because of this stupid app.. I can't????????",Yes
"unable to download. I cannot download skype onto my Kindle Fire HD so I am not satisfied and, therefore, I am unable to give a proper rating for the skype kindle tablet edition.",Yes
Not Greay. At the moment when I'm in a call i can't open another app which isn't helpful because that's the only reason I call is because we are in a game. And I have to constantly leave and close the app just so I can see the messages. It's a real struggle.,Yes
Horrible. I can't receive any calls and now I cannot even sighn in! With I could give a 0,Yes
"Doesn't work at all. Don't waste your time, I bought it for the deployment to keep in touch and it wouldn't load at all",Yes

bad. Sometimes it won't let me connect to groups calls it says connecting for five hours then it says you need to update Skype when I can't because it is at the latest version so fix this,Yes
"Mobile app became unusable after recent update. Last week my mobile Skype decided to update on its own without even asking my permission to do so as any other app would do. Update brought back bunch of garbage from 2 years of prior communications, including all of the blocked and deleted people and bots! To make the matter worse - the is no option to delete the from the screen either.And now the most important issue that mames this Skype update totally worthless - you CAN NOT see which of your contacts is online. The green light feature is gone, it doesn't appear even on Skype echo which is always online. They need to fix that bug,obviously. It is a bug, because yesterday i did see that green light at some point, and after i closed the app and opened it again - it was blind as usual.Please fix it!",Yes
"ENDLESS† CRASHES. I have been trying to use this app on my Kindle Fire for several months now and I can accurately sum up my experience with it like this....I video chat for a minute, Skype starts making dinging sounds, and then it crashes.† I restart this app, video chat for a minute, Skype starts making dinging sounds, and then it crashes.† I restart this app, video chat for a minute, Skype starts making dinging sounds, and then it crashes.† I restart this app, video chat for a minute, Skype starts making dinging sounds, and then it crashes.† I restart this app, video chat for a minute, Skype starts making dinging sounds, and then it crashes.† I restart this app, video chat for a minute, Skype starts making dinging sounds, and then it crashes.† I restart this app, video chat for a minute, Skype starts making dinging sounds, and then it crashes.† I restart this app, video chat for a minute, Skype starts making dinging sounds, and then it crashes.† I restart this app, video chat for a minute, Skype starts making dinging sounds, and then it crashes.† I restart this app, video chat for a minute, Skype starts making dinging sounds, and then it crashes.† I restart this app, video chat for a minute, Skype starts making dinging sounds, and then it crashes........Apparently Skype for Kindle suffers from severe stability issues and is completely unusable.† Even for a free app I feel like I got ripped off because SKYPE IS THE MAIN REASON I AND A MILLION OTHER USERS BOUGHT A KINDLE!† FIX THIS PATHETIC MESS!",Yes
"Update Almost Ruined the Skype OMG. Ugh. The updated Skype is almost horrible. I face too many glitches. One,the volume is too high. Even if Shogunyan mutes my Kindle, I can still hear Richard loudly. Two, Skype continuously crashes for no apparent reason. One minure (I meant to say minute) Skype works and then the next it pops up with a message that says, &#34; Skype is not responding,would you like to close it?&#34; If you say yes it closes the app and you have to reboot. If not, the message keeps popping up. Try to get to the old Skype app? NO, DOESN'T WORK, IT'S NOT IN THE APPSTORE ANYMORE. THEY SHOULD FIX ALL GLITCHES BEFORE PUTTING IT IN THE APPSTORE AGAIN. Oh my god. It's no fair!!!!!!!!!!! Gosh Skype people, you gotta fix the glitches!!!!!??",Yes
"Frustrating to work with.. There's a lot of instances where the notifications tell me I receive a message from a friend, and then when I go to check it, it vanishes. So apparently, Skype 's notifications get the message, but the app doesnt even bother to log what was said, and even when your friend is logged in, it won't show you what was said. You can't even access the history either, which is just overall frustrating. Terrible app to compliment a service that should be better than this.",Yes
"Updaaaaaaate!!!!. This app is horrible and rarely updated much like hundreds of other Kindle apps. I use Skype every Friday. My call gets dropped about 7-8 times every 30 minutes if not more. When I attempt to call back, either the video or audio is gone. It's infuriating. If the Kindle can do no more than display books properly, why not buy a cheaper e reader? This is not the only app I have issues with but it's one of the main ones. I check for updates all the time, (despite the fact that my Kindle is set to automatically download any updates, which it does not) and there is never one to be found.",Yes
"Skype for KF needs an upgrade. I know this most likely will not be noticed, but Kindle Fire Skype seriously needs an update, especially since I've been using the same old Skype for like 2 years now. Its weird when I'm roleplaying or doing the asters sentence asters thing and it doesn't bold like every other version of skype for every other device EXCEPT Kindle Fire. Or none of the newer emojis show, I've had the same boring ole emojis for years now!! I mean cmoon lol. And I cant recieve files anymore because Skype isnt updated, and that makes me sad!!! I mean I get it, there are plenty of other devices out there that need to be more updated then my old Kindle Fire, but i really would like to see a more updated version of Skype for kindle fire. I really hope both microsoft and amazon see this and think yes, we must update. It would be extremely appreciated",Yes
Sucks. Every time I try to video chat on my kindle it doesn't work. It always freezes and it exits me out or you can't hear me. I fixed everything that was wrong with my kindle or thought that was. And that wasn't the problem. Please fix it so I don't have trouble in the future.,Yes
"Can't receive Skype voice calls. Everything works great... except I can't receive calls on my Fire Phone.† When I test, I get an error stating that ""your device currently cannot receive push notifications"".† My device can receive push notifications from other apps.... so I am not sure what is wrong.",Yes
"unable to send photos... still. It's been well over a year since I've been able to send photos via Skype on the kindle fire. Both of my nieces have kindle fires and they have the same issue. I can send them photos from other devices (traditional computers, iPad, iPhone, and my Microsoft Surface) and they can receive those photos. But one cannot send jpegs via Skype for Kindle. This update did not address that issue.",Yes
"Why?!?!?!?!?!?!?!. I give this app 1 star because I can't give it a zero... I was in the middle of a chat with my friend, which I could barley hear and my volume was all the way up. Another friend tried to call me, but I didn't answer it. Then skype kept making this annoying beeping noises. My friend could hear them on the other line. No one was calling me so I knew it was a glitch... after 5 minutes, I got sick of the noise. I closed skype ans restarted it. THE NOISE DIDN'T STOP! I forced stop the app... guess what... IT DIDN'T STOP!!! I finally gave up and deleted the app... IT. DIDN'T. STOP.... finally, after a few more minutes, the noise stopped. I went to go download skype again, but it made my whole kindle glitch. No all my friends are expecting calls that I can't give... FIX THIS PLEASE...",Yes
dont waste your space. The latest update to allow friends to video chat was removed due to the kindle fire hd memory leaking and wont be getting anymore updates ?????? its not right for the developer to not update skype for kindle fire hd 3rd gen when a bunch of other apps are still being updated dont buy any kindles as they dont always get the same updates as android or google play,Yes
"Crashing and volume issues. The main issue I have with Skype is the fact that it crashes constantly. I could be video chatting with someone or simply rotating my kindle before Skype decides it's too much for it to handle that it will crash. After the update, I also noticed I wasn't able to hear the person I called, even after raising the volume all the way up. Took me a while to realize that you can raise the volume specifically for Skype calls that you can ONLY access just as you are calling the person before they answer (you do this by pressing the volume control on the side of the tablet).PLEASE FIX THIS. It is very annoying and highly inconvenient.",Yes
"This sucks. I used to use this app all the time, so that I could talk to my boyfriend and my friends since I'm away at college, but the app updated and now I can't make calls. I can't accept calls. AND THE APP KEEPS CRASHING. This is the only app I have that does this. And I'm so sad and frustrated. Yeah, I can call my friends, but I'd rather see their faces AND hear their voices. It looks like I'm going to have to fuss with and deal with Google hangouts or the Facebook video chat. Please update the app, SO THAT IT WORKS, HAS NO BUGS, AND DOESN'T CRASH. Thank you!",Yes
"Terrible!. I have used Skype for quite a while, and recently skype had updated. I can no longer make calls nor receive them.† I think the problem has to do with the update and it should be fixed soon!",Yes
"Nonstop Crashing. Before the update, my kindle could take video calls with no problem, recently I can't get a video call to last longer than a minute before the screen goes white and the app goes unresponsive. If I do manage to get back to the message screen without turning the kindle off, I can't call of anything without it crashing completely, so I have to turn it off and then on again. It will only take voice calls, which is very frustrating since I'm trying to keep in touch with close people across various countries and we would like to speak face to face. I have no idea what this is, and it's driving me nuts. Fix this app! I would like to be able to make video calls again, and I would like for files to show up again like it used to. Very annoyed.",Yes
"Terrible update!. Up until this last week Skype has been a good app.† If an update is going to be pushed out, shouldn't a company make sure that it'll work properly?† After this last update I can't use Skype to video chat with my family!† Terrible update.",Yes
"Won't stop crashing. In the middle of all my video chats, Skype will randomly crash and go back to the main page. After it crashes and I bring it back up, I can't make calls or answer calls without it crashing again. I always have to reset my kindle. It seems to work for a little bit, sometimes only a few seconds into a video chat, but it always crashes. I have very little way to contact people back home and this is the only way get to see them for months that I am away so I would really appreciate if all the s*** that is wrong with the app would be fixed.",Yes
Pathetic. This app used to work when I first got my Kindle. Then it updated and has never since worked properly. First there were problems with audio while on calls. Then it started crashing. Then the audio problems resolved with no aid from support. Now the video has started completely going black and the app will freeze and take me back to the friends screen. When I try and call back (it crashes the call) the video still does not work. Restarting the app does not work. Reinstalling the app does not work. Restarting the Kindle briefly worked but it quickly went back to doing the same thing. I have uninstalled the app and it will stay that way.,Yes
poor volume. I have been using this app for well over a year. And it's been awesome.Then it recently updated and now the volume sucks and I can't hear the person on the other end and keeps shutting off and freezing. Please fix soon.,Yes
"New Update.. The new update is horrible. First of all, if you are on a video call with someone and you try to put your video on, within ten minutes the whole page will turn white and crash. Also, it constantly will say ""Skype has stopped working, would you like to close it?"" You have no choice in the matter. If you don't close it, the same message will keep popping up, therefore FORCING you to close it. If you have an older version of Skype, keep it. You will not be able to get your old version back if updated to this version. Also, if you want to type a long message out, your keyboard will lag like crazy. I do not recommend this update to anyone.",Yes
"Recently gotten HORRIBLE. I used to get on skype almost every single day. I just recently got my internet back and i updated skype. BIG MISTAKE. I tried voice chatting with my friends in different states when not even 15 minutes into the call. It stops up. So i pull down my screen and clicked on skype where it said it had stopped up. I really want to talk to my friends but this is horrible. I am now switching to oovoo unless Microsoft can fix this utterly ridiculous app, that used to work perfectly.",Yes
Bad. Can't voice call on my kindle fair (3rd generation) this is horrible. I use it to talk to friends out of state and all I can do is message people. Fix it so it works on all kindle and phones.,Yes
"It doesn't work on kindle. The only time I can Skype is if we are both calling each other simultaneously.† If not, then it rings incessantly, even if I shut the app off or even TURN THE VOLUME OFF!† The only solution that stops theincessant ringing is if I turn the device completely off.",Yes
Really stupid. I try to face time my bots but it doesn't work,Yes
"Bring back the Skype version that came with my Kindle Fire HD. The version of Skype that came with my Kindle Fire HD 7 (previous generation) worked splendidly.† Then came these nasty messages from Skype saying that I had to upgrade to the current version.† ""had to"" because I couldn't get past these messages to use Skype.† OK...so I upgraded.† Now Skype doesn't work at all on my Kindle.† Period.† Am now using Yahoo Messenger instead.† What a joke this new version of Skype is.† Clearly it was not at all well tested before being released.",Yes
"Only part of it works. So I use Skype on my computer with little problem. The app for my kindle fire HDX will let me video chat with someone. The problem is that We can both hear each other, they can see me, but I can't see them.† Once this problem is fixed I will change my rating. Until then it only gets 3 stars.",Yes
"Canr even use it. On my kindle fire, I can't even download it! It just says open, but when I click open it just takes me back to the same oage! Pls help. Not sure if it is a app problem or a kindle problem.",Yes
"Junk. No matter how good my Internet is this program is always laggy. Terrible video quality and it will freeze and crash. Also the pip of my camera is large enough to obscure who I'm talking to, why can't I remove or shrink it? This app needs some serious fixes. Look elsewhere for video chat.",Yes
"won't let me Create a account. I can't even deal with this I've tried and tried about like 50 times. After I put in all my info, and I press create It says"" I'm sorry but we can not log into this app right now, please check your mobile network",Yes
"Yeeesh...Very Difficult To Set Up. Who designed this kludge? The Obamacare Dream Team Website Design Group?? Setting up an account is simple enough, but establishing contacts not so much. My wife and I tried to set up our accounts tonight and sent the requisite contact requests to each other. Neither one of us saw any requests come in, even tho we sent requests to each other. The help videos stop right where we stopped. The app looks okay on my 8.9-inch Kindle, but the words run together on my wife's 7-inch. Very poorly designed.",Yes
"Breaks all the time. This app, while being a great application - when it's working - for connecting with your friends, has so many issues. It constantly stops working, often gives me issues with signing in and I have to restart over and over again. I have had to uninstall it numerous times in order to fix it. These problems are so awful I think it should cost a negative amount and give you money to use their godforsaken app.",Yes
"worse thing imaginable. I like to Skype with a friend who is stationed in Korea, well I'd like to. I'm unable to because the app constantly crashes or logs me out and won't let me log back in. It's really annoying. I can't wait for a company to create a different and better version of Skype so I could jump this sinking ship for something that actually works. Would not recommend to anyone and will never use again.",Yes
"don't waste your time or money.... Zero stars.† Crappitty crap crap crap.† Simply doesn't work without all the usual MS convoluted bug ridden ""enhancements"" to a frightfully incompetent, disasterously poor product.† Wait!† it doesn't work even with them!† it's even worse than i imagined.† it's caught me in an endless loop of failure, and sad for me, i can't get it to work and so they'll confiscate my credit; goodbye 7 euros.† bloody worthless.",Yes
"the update.... Oh, the update. It's awful. It's crashing constantly and causing additional issues with my kindle. FIX IT. I want to be able to use it, but it needs work.",Yes
Skype on Kindle..Blows. I have never been able to get a complete session active without Skype rebooting on the kindle. I think there is a problem with the camera process and Skype.It resizes and then goes into reboot.I hate it on the kindle,Yes
Useless on Kindle. Keeps telling me there is a problem with my account.,Yes
"No. Just NO.. I used to like Skype. A lot. But after it got updated, I HATE IT. Now I can't multitask as much anymore (as in talking on Skype and doing something else). Sometimes when I'm talking with someone on Skype and I go off the app to another one, it stops and disconnects my call. Yes, the appearance looks better, but technological wise, it sucks. Please get the bugs fix :/ I hate it. The camera on Skype is disoriented for my Kindle Fire. I thought maybe it was my device or internet connection, but I tried restarting it and everything, but the condition still is the same. It's bad for me that's why I'm leaving a review for those of you who haven't updated Skype yet to NOT UPDATE IT. Hopefully it gets better so I can change the star ratings :/",Yes
doesn't work at all. This app is horrible not worth your time for it to download.† Can't hear anything and the picture doesn't work for the person you are talking to because it is so delayed.,Yes
"Update also ruined it for me as well.. Update also ruined it for me as well. Bought Kindle Fire HD with Skype pre-loaded, now, with the new app update, old app not loading and the update fails all the time. This effectively makes Skype app unusable. What is worse I sent the tablet oversees for my mom to use and she now is unable to use video to communicate, back to phone.",Yes
"Fire HD user. The first few days all was fine, after that I stopped getting notifications and missed calls every time! It crashes for no reason, you can barely hear the person on the other end. It's all crap!",Yes
"Don't waste your time.. Upon finally getting it downloaded unto my Fire HD, couldn't sign in to save my soul. Don't bother with this one.",Yes
HELP ME!!. I can't connect to group chat. It's not fair that only kindle os get video calls. Please help me... I have a kindle HDX,Yes
worst app evey. It logs me out when I'm talking to someone then I can't log back in.,Yes
update needed asap. unable to connect. Ihave updated the app but it doesnt work,Yes
"miserable app. I can't find anything in the settings, I can't delete conversations, it is super glitchy, I keep getting sent spam with inappropriate content. Should I go on? I can, this this can keep going, it doesn't connect to WiFi well, the emoji's and video clips hardly ever work, it takes 15 minutes to send pictures...",Yes
Annoying. Worked fine for a couple of days. Now I can't even use it as it automatically signs out on my kindle fire everytime I close the app.,Yes
Issues. Don't understand why I can join group calls on all other devices except on the kindle. It sits on the connecting screen then freezes the kindle...SKYPE GET THIS FIXED please,Yes
crashes. Well Skype is new on my kindle fire. I have had it for over a year with hardly any problems. Until now. It keeps crashing and I can't video chat at all. I don't know if it is just my kindle fire or Skype itself...but something needs to be fixed and I think it is the app.,Yes
problematic since update. This was an absolute must have app for any Kindle owners. Since the recent update the app loses video and crashes on every call. Very frustrating. I would go for another option until they can address the issues caused by the latest update.,Yes
Will not sign in.. I don't know how many times a Skype account needs to be recovered by Tim done. This app is worthless. Can't even sign in after going through all the recovery and reset garbage.,Yes
"what ever you did Skype, CHANGE IT IMMIDIATY. Use to work real well but now all my video calls get stopped for no reason. It's very annoying. PLEASE FIX",Yes
"very bad frezee app. frezee and stop many problems bad very bad, dont recomend this app, maybe† in the future solve the fails, maybe",Yes
Horrible.. New update is the problem.... I can Skype people but when it connects my video will turn on but theirs won't and it just beeps everytime they try to turn it on. Fix it and I'll give a higher rate,Yes
bad. I can't make Skype calls it doesn't work on my kindle really upset pls fix it and they can't see me too,Yes
"Wasted enough time on this. Worthless app.† Amazon tells me I have the latest update, my kindle tells me I need to check my mobile network settings.† Neither amazon or Skype offer any intuitive ways to get of square one.† Wasted enough time on this.",Yes
"it's terrible. I love my cellphone, but this app doesn't work well, when I'm using the other person on the line only can hear me if I use the headphones. Please try to fix this problem,I don't want to return my phone.",Yes
Can't hear. Got the update the other day.....now I can't hear the other person even with my volume turned all the way up. I'm giving one star until it's fixed.,Yes
"Hadley Ever Works. There is always an issue with my Skype. I can't see the person, they can't see me. It always freezes. It always shuts down. When it does work, it's choppy. I like Skype but it's not for my Kindle.",Yes
"can't use in diff. country. I can't skype people in other countries, it keeps saying I need a country code but won't work when I type it in!!!",Yes
"waste of time. It doesn't work properly. It opens but has no volume and then constantly crashes. I was forced to update and it was a waste of time, I'm deleting it!",Yes
"Not a working app.† Will not allow area code to be entered. I am really peeved that the Skype download for Kindle Fire HD 8.9 does not allow for you to add the area/local code, so that you can obtain a number for your device on the local network.† This renders video chatting with other friends on Skype useless, since they have no contact number with which to reach you.† I tried to delete it twice and reload the application, and even tried the android application.† Nothing I did corrected the problem.† If you don't put the area code in and just have the state, like Texas, it gives you a phone area code for San Antonio, which is 5 hours away.† Someone needs to seriously look at this and make a correction to the app., or give us a way to fix it.† Skype is one of the main video chatting apps that most people use.† Had I known it was useless I would have spent my money on the Ipad, but i figured all i needed was to video chat and didn't need to have a camera on the back for vidoes and pictures that the Ipad includes.† At least Ipad can use SKYPE!† I'd give this app a zero if it allowed....",Yes
"frustrating. Tried to use this to tall with family overseas. Absolutely terrible. The video quality is okay. But the audio both ways is garbage. I can't hear audio coming in. They can't hear it on their end, even with the volume turned all the way up. Disappointing to say the least.",Yes
"Won't even load. After roughly 10 minutes of loading, I get an error message telling me it can't sign me in even though I know I have the right credentials. This has happened to me at least 5 times. Skype and Amazon please fix this! :(",Yes
connection. Can't connect - useless error message - eventually found possible solution on web - download latest version - option does not exist - hate Skype,Yes
video lags behind audio. The video lags several seconds behind the audio. It's not a network issue as I have fast internet speeds and have tried it on several other networks.† Very annoying and I wish they would fix it,Yes
terrible update. I can't get the update to work and I've tried 29 times and it keeps crashing and won't let me get the update,Yes
CANT CREATE ACCOUNT. When I try to create an account I use a fake email and doesn't work anymore but it did before,Yes
Bad browser.. It crashed and freezes within minutes of opening a web site.Is there an alternative? How do you fix this problem?,Yes
horrible. I can't even deleted the app from my Fire Phone.,Yes
poor app quality on Kindle. This app really needs major improvement especially on Kindle gadgets. Always Hangs & crashes. I hope this issue will be resolved.,Yes
Useless. If I can't sign-in. It's useless.,Yes
horrible update. It won't let me update my Skype and I can't send emoticons or send the cool no videos that it was supposed to update me to,Yes
"Get it together, Skype. This app doesn't work. Plain and simple. I can't make calls, I can't receive calls, what's the point of having this app? I'll download it again when it actually works.",Yes
something wrong?. Skype doesn't work anymore on my BlackBerry! And my Mac! What's up people! I hope this is fixed soon! I worked fine in the past!,Yes
This is going terrible!. I'm trying to talk to† my friend and I look up their name and all these people pop up and I can t tell who she is cause I can't get any pictures either on their profile! I need help with this app!,Yes
sound quality sucks. The app works well from a video quality standpoint but the output volume is unbearably low and there is no way to manually adjust it using the buttons on the kindle. This is a weird problem to encounter considering this app cam pre-installed on my kindle fire hd 8.9 smh sheesh.. without being able to hear this app is useless imo,Yes
Skype sucks. This new Skype update sucks really bad. It turns off whenever one is on video call. It also clashes and ask one to wait or close the application. This makes no sense at all. Worse scenario ever. Skype and amazon kindled suck because I don't know the source of this problem with Skype. Perhaps Skype sucks sucks and sucks!,Yes
not happy. Skype keeps crashing I've never had this problem on any other device....when I call someone out someone calls me Skype stops responding I hate it out crashes do much fix it please,Yes
"Poor....glad this was not a primary reason for my Fire HD purchase. I have not gotten this to work yet on a brand new Kindle Fire HD 8.9"".† The app either claims that it cannot connect due to ""network setting"" problems, or it crashes back out to the home screen while trying to load my contact list.",Yes

terrible. Every time I try to call it forcecloses and just don't work. At all.I have lots of problems with it.,Yes
"Useless, don't bother downloading. I don't normally review apps, but when I do its because they are so completely useless and don't work at all so I feel the need to rant about it.Seriously though, I have a kindle fire hdx and this doesn't work on it.",Yes
"Kindle Fire HD Version of Skype went from bad to worse. If you plan to use your Kindle Fire HD as a tablet for Skype, look elsewhere. Buy an I-pad or an Android tablet for Skype instead.† Skype used to work albeit buggy on the Kindle Fire, now it is all but unusable.† You can't hear the party you called and the app hangs within a few minutes. If you wait for it to recover, forget about it, the Kindle will simply reboot.",Yes
can't hear. My niece set it up for me she can hear me but I can't hear her on my Fire we spent 2 days trying to sort it out but gave up in the end,Yes
Gave up on it.. Just couldn't get it to work. Waste of time.,Yes
"Group call. Unable to join group call, using kindle fire.",Yes
"Eccentric as ever. Seems to work. As ever, the deletion of past instant messaging sessions is problematic, and has a different look and feel from both the windows,Win 8,† and iOS versions, each of which seem to follow their own path. Standardisation seems beyond Skype, even now it's MS owned.Overall, and irritating, and poorly documented app.",Yes
It has become utterly unintuitive un unhelpful in use. .... It has become utterly unintuitive un unhelpful in use. Tried loading it to my new Fire Tablet and it assumed that I was loading it to my Sony mobile phone - unable to fix. I have given it 1 star because there seem no option to give 0.,Yes
"Not very impressed.. Unable to get it to work properly. Sometimes can't connect, other times cuts out if we do connect. Sound fails or picture fails. Unresponsive when answering a call.",Yes
"I was unable to access Skype, I want to .... I was unable to access Skype, I want to video skype my Family in another country but couldn't log in why?",Yes
Can't use camera on Kindle Fire. Shockingly bad on Kindle Fire as will not work with the camera. Works spot on with the Amazon screens but 1star is due to failing with the Fire tablet. Come on Amazon and wake up with this as it is clearly a tablet issue!,Yes
Can't record calls!. All Skype versions on other devices has this option. Why not this one?,Yes
"No voice No video!!!!. Why doesn't work the voice and video options!!Always tell me ""is not accessible !!!""",Yes
Absolute waste of time and they have no customer service. Didn't work on kindle fire. Kept emaling me a password which it didn't recognize. Absolute waste of time and they have no customer service. Very poor.,Yes
Cant hear caller. I loaded this onto my kindle fire and although the product works I am unable to hear caller even after adjusting all my kindle settings. So I can make calls and be heard but can't hear my caller but can message them. Not exactly what I wanted but unless someone can tell me what to do to hear my caller its not perfect,Yes
Unable to get it to work. Due to prior registration some years back and despite changing both email address and password I have still been unable to get this App to work. I will instead use an alternative,Yes
"Skype is a horrible way to communicate via the internet. Skype is a horrible way to communicate via the internet. I had countless dropped connections, video errors, audio problems etc. Am in process of finding an alternative way to keep in touch with my family abroad.",Yes
One Star. I am still unable to access this site,Yes
"Faulty and has been for years.. If I could give the app 0 stars I would. The app has a fault and won't let my kindle fire make or receive video calls, which is the only reason we downloaded it. Ive done some research and it's a very common problem for Amazon users and has been for years! It's a shame neither Amazon or Skype have fixed it.",Yes
Just doesn't work. Won't let me make or receive calls. Same account works perfectly on other devices.,Yes
"Useless. Just stopped working! I can no longer make or receive calls, it's pretty much useless",Yes
Waste of time. Doesn't work. Unable to make or receive video calls. Not worth downloading.,Yes
"YO DUOLINGO PLEASE UPDATE YOUR APP. Multiple people are having the same problem as me, where they can't access their language learning because the app is out of date. This is so sad Alexa play Despacito.",Yes

"FREEZES. It is a fun game IF it doesn't freeze,† which it does† OFTEN.† VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!! I am unable to complete the sentence† portion.† I press buttons.... NOTHING happens.",Yes
"Fun, but frustrating!!. Now don't get me wrong. This is a great teaching app, and most of the time I don't have a problem with it. It does however have little annoyances that need to be addressed. Some of the translators for the 'speak and type what you heard' entries speak HORRIBLY, and are very difficult to hear even when you hit the 'Slowly' button and the speaker breaks down the sentence. I took 2 years of German in high school and just WASHED OUT of Duolingo's German placement test, largely due to the fact that the translator sounds like she has gum in her mouth!!!! ???????? Additionally, I found the Irish language translator it too quiet to hear even with my Kindle at maximum volume!! Please address these issues.",Yes
"Not really ""Free"". While the approach is engaging and fun to use, I find this supposedly free ap extremely frustrating.† It only allows you to make 5 ""mistakes"" before you must either buy more health or wait several hours to continue.† This is annoying because I only have a limited time to study Italian before embarking on a trip to Italy and having to come to a stop when I have time to study makes me crazy. I don't expect to be speaking Italian but just wanted to have some exposure and basic vocabulary,† This would be fine for that if minor grammar errors didn't keep stopping me.",Yes
"great learning program, buggy app. Duolingo is an incredible learning program that I've been using for a long time - on my computer. This app normally doesn't give me problems, but lately it's been exiting out of a lesson (or worse, a test) randomly and my progress is lost completely. It's really frustrating! I don't know if it's only me, but I would recommend using duolingo on some other device like a computer or even an iPod or iPhone.",Yes
"Kindle app terrible! No longer works!. Duolingo is amazing. This is for the kindle app only! Fewer and few apps work for kindle including this one. My kindle is turning into a paperweight. After an update this stopped working and said ""unavailable"" from the store. I can still access from my computer which is great on the part of Duolingo BUT the KINDLE APP WONT WORK! Amazon you should be embarrassed :(",Yes
App stopped working. No longer works on Kindle fire. Very frustrating.,Yes
can't install. Unable to install.,Yes
"Can't log in. Can't log in on Kindle Fire 7. When I hit sign in, it just takes me to the log in page again; an endless loop. Worthless!",Yes
didnt load. this app is a waste of time and effort. It would not even load.† do not waste your time downloading.,Yes
Not working with my kindle fire. Using kindle fire. Pictures are not showing up :( can't use it...,Yes
"crap. the app never opened and it just acted like it was going to load, but never did. Don't waste your time",Yes
"Can't Continue past lesson 1. as someone else mentioned, you get to the end of lesson 1 and the 'continue' button is grayed out so you can't do anything but quit, which loses your progress. great app besides that part which makes it useless.",Yes
One Star. Downloaded to kindle fire hd but unable to locate on devuce,Yes
Couldn't Connect to get to languages. Removed it from my device!† Tried for two days to connect using my Amazon account to connect for language.† Kept saying no account or wrong password. I have no problems receiving Amazon emails. Frustrated so I got rid of it. Can't say how good the program is because I never got that far. I don't do Facebook or Twitter so I didn't have that option.,Yes
"Can't get past sign in page. I have tried signing in several times and several ways, but to no avail. The app won't move past the sign in page.",Yes
"can't continue. Sound went out, downloaded again and now can't continue because it says my email is already taken. Worthless",Yes
"I can't make this work on my Kindle Fire. With plans to travel in Europe next year, I was hoping to learn at least some conversational German, but I can't manage to even sign in on my Kindle Fire.† I receive an error message that my email and password is not correct, even though I've entered it correctly several times.† I've even uninstalled and re-installed the app in hopes of accessing it.† Any suggestions?",Yes
doesn't work on BBPB. Doesn't work on my Blackberry Playbook. Can't even do the install. :(Everything I try to get through the Amazon Apps Store doesn't work.,Yes
"crap for kindle. great app on the phone, but doesnt work on kindle. no way to log in through facebook. endless loop of sign in requests. Worst part is it seems this has been an issue for a long time by the other negative reviews.",Yes
Won't install on Kindle Fire. Can't install this at all on my kindle. Updated and still can't install. The app got enough of my info to put me on their email list though :/,Yes
"unable to view. Sorry I cannot offer a positive review , as† app would not open I tried troubleshooting follow instruction , still would not open",Yes
Waste of Space. DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME,Yes
"Duolingo. unable to download on my kindle, but fine on the computer.",Yes
"Stopped working on Amazon Fire. Great app but now it's stopped working on Amazon fire, very annoying! As soon as you log in it goes back to the start screen.",Yes
"I† have been unable to acsess the language program, so I am not qualified to judge.. I had difficulty loading the program† and could not remember my password. I was unable to get a new pass word an spent much time going round in circles. I may try again at another time, I am sure I will enjoy the program if I can get past the obsticles",Yes
Amazon store version is useless. I'm an existing Duolingo user with the Play Store version on my phone. I downloaded the Amazon Store version to my Kindle Fire only to find I can't use the app as I signed up using my Google + account and there's no support for it in this version. I'm guessing it's the same for the Amazon version loaded onto an Android phone too. Sadly another example of Amazon apps lagging behind those on Play Store & 1 Market. Frustrating to have a tablet with great potential undermined by poor apps.,Yes
"in this day and age creating an account shouldn't be so difficult!. I understand this app is and will be good, however having stupid simple problems creating an account as their instructions are so basic as to be clueless!",Yes
App does not work on the Fire tablet. You can install this app from the Amazon store but it basically doesn't work on the Fire tablet as it won't allow you to get past the login screen. Other reviewers say the same thing. You would think that the developers would be embarassed.,Yes
"Cant use it. Unable to use this app without a facebook account.As I have no need or desire to create a facebook account, this app is totally useless to me.",Yes
"I want to give this five stars - if this .... I want to give this five stars - if this were the iPad version, I would. However, every time my son tries to practice his Spanish, he does well until a question comes that requires him to type. At this point, the game freezes. No keyboard shows up, and he can't even click ""check"" (and get it wrong) to move on to the next question. It's frustrating, to say the least.",Yes
"Like it. Its fun, but every single time I go onto the app Food 2 is weakened. I get every single one correct! I am learning Spanish. Plus it never makes it clear when to use escribe or escriben or escribed or whatever. Plus when it says to listen then type it in I can't because I'm in bed at night or in a public place. Also the idioms is just terrible in my opinion. It was a huge waste of time. I just hate it how I never get a word wrong but I still have to redo every lesson",Yes
"Great Until Its Not. I love this app, usually with language apps it's either hit or miss with most of them on the miss side. This app actually teaches you not only vocabulary but also grammar in a very concise step by step guide. I'd say it's almost like a mini Rosetta stone. My problem comes when I'm in the middle of a lesson and all of a sudden it goes back to the menu. I'm using kindle fire HDX so I don't know if that has something to do with it. It's incredibly annoying and frustrating when you have to do the same lesson five times because of crashes. I really enjoy this app, and it's actually helping me learn some Spanish but I'm going to be forced to stop if I can't move forward. Please fix this.",Yes
"Login Glitch. I am unable to use the app, as it resets to the login screen every time I choose a language.",Yes
Annoying glitch. This app is great when trying to brush up on a language that you have a foundation on.† I can't get my bonus knowledge to fill up so that I can proceed through the rest of the lessons without looking all caught up.† It drives me crazy & affects my frequency using this app now.,Yes
the thing I liked least was I was unable to hear them properly. the talking repetition of words and sentences.the thing I liked least was I was unable to hear them properly sometimes,Yes
"Fun and addicting.. Can't stop using, however has been slow to respond lately.",Yes
"trying three languages. Could be improved with a word list and a sample of conjugated verbs.† Starts out by ""testing"" which is more gamelike, but you lose hearts when you can't answer a question that asks you for a word that you've never heard or seen in writing.† That part is likely due to the random selection of questions from the ""test bank.""† This wasn't too bad in German and Spanish which I had some familiarity with, but French is completely new, so this shows up more often.† The spoken words are sometimes difficult to understand, too.",Yes
not accessible for me.. I actually have the program and wanted to try the app.† What a waste of time.† 1. It won't recognize my sigin. 2. Try to demo and every single time I select language the app kicks me out.† So I am getting rid of the app.,Yes
waste† of time. first you need a account to get into this app† has no free language to see if you would like the product† please pass this waste of time,Yes
One Star. Unable to learn words or how to pronounce.,Yes
won't work/crashes. only ap to ever crash on my iphone 5s. not worth wait time to download it.† not sure what the problem is.,Yes
"Orientation Messed Up. I didn't even get to try the app. Every time I opened it,† the app turned upside down before I had a chance to push any buttons. I turned the tablet around and within a few seconds the app turned upside down again. This happened over and over. None of my other apps have ever had this problem. Who ever programmed this app needs to fix this problemI have heard good things about Rosetta and would like to try it, but I can't use it upside down.",Yes
Tricky to stay logged in when travelling internationally. I like the app and system but I hate when I'm trying to use it on a plane and I need to randomly login again and I might not have Wi-Fi or a mobile connection. This is more often an issue on mobile† but it occurs for kindle as well,Yes
overall good.but.... one problem i had was that in Japanese i whould get frustrated and tap random buttons and still get 100%.,Yes
"Doesn't work well on Windows 10 computers. I purchased this and could not get it to work on my Windows 10 computers. It works fine on my phone and my Kindle, but the speech recognition model would not download on my computer and kept giving me an icon error message with no explanation of what was wrong. Rosetta stone staff not able to help. So don't buy if you can only access it on a computer.",Yes
"Can;t use the app on Kindle Fire. I downloaded this app, but I am unable to use it on Kindle Fire. Nothing happens when I try to log in so I guess it is not compatible",Yes
rosetta stone. unable to connect,Yes
waste. Waste of time; no information,Yes
I hate this. I can't go back,Yes
It can't always hear correctly. Great app but either the Mic on the Kindle stinks or the voice recognition on the app stinks.,Yes
"I'm frustrated.. I can't get the voice to play and that is really frustrating. Also, since everything is the first time you have heard or seen it, you are guessing what means what.",Yes
"The learning material is good and there is a lot of it BUT .... The learning material is good and there is a lot of it, but there are serious issues with the software that delivers it.The application will hang and crash from time to time.The 'Milestones' are terribly buggy and you have no idea what is expected of you. And you can't turn them off in the options, so the system keeps taking you back to them. Also you can't skip them promptly either.You can turn of the spelling questions at least, which you can't do in Babbel (yet).Some of the pictures are outright confusing (although you soon learn them) - and who thought to put white speech bubbles on a white background? Its sometimes impossible to tell who is meant to be speaking.My windows laptop and kindle fire HD do NOT synchronise - some reviews here state they do but I couldn't get it work.On the upside the speech recognition is good (That is probably the one part they didn't program).",Yes
Love it but locks up my FireHD6. I have a paid subscription and use this app regularly.Unfortunately every time I use it to do a lesson it freezes my tablet at least once and needs rebooted because cannot get the control back. I just hope this annoying issue will be fixed. This error does not exist on my android device.,Yes
Does not work. Waste of time could not get app to work,Yes
:(. Can't sign in.,Yes
Boring. Boring,Yes
"Update app to solve this issue.. Content is great, app is terrible. Can't play downloaded video.",Yes
Wait of time.. Canít watch it as it wonít download at all.What a waste of time,Yes
"I REALLY want to Love it. I live in Denver, home of ""Sam's No.3"" and their ""Kickin' Green Chili"". I was super excited to see ""Food Network in the Kitchen"" had the recipe. (Triple D did a show there). BUT, every time I open ""Sam's No.3 Kickin' Green Chili"" the app goes into lock down. The picture loads and then ""Unfortunately, In the Kitchen has stopped"" ""OK"". Well, no, as a matter of fact, it's NOT okay. Plus, it doesn't reload, you have to close and reopen the app.Now, maybe... MAYBE, this one recipe is the ONLY one that does this... I-D-K! It's the one I want!The only thing worse than taking a toy from a child, is to give it back... broken.",Yes
I want to give it 5 stars.... But it keeps crashing ! I'm unable to see the recipes. Please fix the kinks and make it work so I can use it!!!,Yes
doesn't work. When I clicked on a chef it stopped working. Finally had to remove it from the device. Evidently not made for kindle fire. Don't bother. Waste of time.,Yes
"not working. When I click on a chef† it says in kitchen has stopped & I have to press ok & that's as far as I get, a couple of timesI got through on a chef I didn't really want ,so not helpful for me. Frustrated!!",Yes
"the kitchen is closed. It is very annoying that every time I try to go to an individual personality's page it constantly closes the app, I have sent several emails about this issue with no resolution.",Yes
Unable to save recipes to box.. Saw some things of interest but when I tried to save to recipe box it always came up an error. So I have deleted it.,Yes
"closes constantly. Not sure if anyone else is having this problem but the app closes itself constantly. No other app on my brand new kindle has a problem except this one. It's become a tease because I will turn it on, browse, see something awesome... then BAM it turns off... drives me insane. I have tried reinstalling twice now. Someone help! Totally agree about the pictures too. Not enough.",Yes
"Never works. Very unhappy with this app. Every time I try to open a chef site a notation pops up telling me the kitchen has stopped. Useless, a waste of time.",Yes
Recipe Box?. I found a number of recipes I would like to save but when I try to add to the recipe box it will not add. I have it on my Kindle Fire HD and I see from other reviews that this should not be a problem.,Yes
Can not get it to activate. I have tried 4-5 times to activate this app over the last two weeks. I put in my password and it takes me to a screen to put in an OTP number which I do. I think click sign-in and it will never take me past this page. I really want to use this app but I can't make it work and can't find any help or info about it.,Yes
"Food Net work ap. this ap would not open i tried numerous times, finally gave up and deleted it!!† don't waste your time on this one.",Yes
Doesn't work. App constantly closed and won't open.,Yes
"Not free. Say's its free, but only for a year, which you find out after you order.† Doesn't work and I can not figure out how to cancel the stupid thing.",Yes
program won't play. Program shuts down as soon as I select a chef.† Is it a problem with my Kindle Fire or is it a problem with the app?,Yes
"For the most part it's good... ...but for some reason i have been unable to create an account, password, etc that will allow me to start a recipe box. Annoying to have to retrae my steps all the time.",Yes
"Can't use this. Every time I try t use this by selecting a specific† recipe, the ap stops working.† I cleaned out a bunch of other aps I don't use or like. Will see now if it will work.",Yes
Can't use it unless you have Xfinity. Find out after you watch something a few times you have to have Xfinity. Won't let you watch it anymore.,Yes
"Needs improvement on all platforms. Let me start by saying that I have the iOS version, which is installed on both my iPhone and iPad.† It was as five-star app for a while, until iOS 7 was released.† I think they released one update that made it compatible with 7, but it came with an annoying bug - it makes you log in EVERY SINGLE TIME you want to access your recipe box, even though I had the ""keep me logged in"" thing checked off.† Very annoying.† I let the app developers know about this, they say they are aware of it, and it will be fixed in the next update.† This was months ago, I am still waiting for that update.When I saw that the Kindle Fire version was free (I paid $1.99 for the iOS version), I decided to give it a try and see if I can use it and avoid the log in issue.† That part worked.† What DOESN'T work is inside the recipe box itself.† When I tap on one recipe, it takes me to a completely different recipe.† It's not like I tapped the one next to it by mistake; it takes me to recipes that aren't even next to the one I tapped on.† This makes the whole recipe box feature almost useless; what is the point of having it if you can't quickly access the exact recipe you want?† Apps like this are supposed to make life easier, but this one in any form is more hassle than it is worth.† Maybe I'll try it again, if they EVER update it.† I'm not holding my breath waiting for that, though.† It's actually easier now to just go to foodnetwork.com on my device, log in there, and access my recipe box that way.",Yes
"In the kitchen. When I open the app, I just get the message ""In the kitchen has stopped"". So far the app is useless! I will probably delete it, unless it starts werking soon.",Yes
"poor functionality. Many things work poorly in this app. Scrolling through search results keep coming back to the recipes, as if it can't keep track of what page it's on. You can't add a recipe to the recipe box at all, at least not intuitively. Many recipes are repeated. There doesn't seem to be any organization to the recipes such as by tags, cooking methods, etc. I could go on and on. This app was written by amateurs. I ditched it and just used the website.",Yes
"Doesn't work. Don't get past the ""preparing food "" part, just goes in a circle.† It does nothing, no recipes or hints.† I believe it loaded wrong.",Yes
"why doesn't my license work?. Nice app but it only runs for a few minutes then closes and tells me my license is no good.† I payed for the thing, can't use it and can't get my money back.† Fix this and I will fix my rating.† If it does not work on Android or has some other glitch then it should be in the features or bug section.",Yes
How do I get rid of it?. Waste of my time.,Yes
"Not working. I have yet to even open it as I keep getting ""Unfortunately, In the kitchen as stopped"" and no reason for it and can't do anything about it.",Yes
Food Channel Access. After we downloaded this app we were unable to access any of the programs. Should not be this hard.,Yes
"it's lousy as is FN's customer service. Ever since FN supposedly improved their log-in I have not been able to get into my recipe box on my Kindle Fire. All I get is the broken egg sorry screen. I have tried deleting Waldron both the device and the cloud with no success. I emailed them about this and was told to use the website. Then last week I responded to their &#34;help us improve the app&#34; survey with the same problem. No response. FYI, I tried to give 0 stars but that isn't permissible.",Yes
it's a bit slow and the # of recipes are .... it's a bit slow and the # of recipes are limited. It will be interesting to see how often it is updated,Yes
I have not had an opportunity to try this app .... I have not had an opportunity to try this app due to all of the problems I have been dealing with with my Kindle.,Yes
it's great but. I CAN'T DELETE MY SHOPPING LIST :( to many items and I can't properly tell what I need anymore.... so annoying.,Yes
"App stinks!. Cancelled it right away.† Bogus.† Doesn't work, keeps going back to make you sign up again, wants you to buy, buy, buy...† Bad.",Yes
in the kitchen does not load. Unable to pick a chef:† In the Kitchen could not load.† All chefs affected. Needed a chef recipe for Mac and cheese.,Yes
Unable to stream. Was unable to stream because of my internet. I returned the fire stick.,Yes
"Signed up and it disappeared. Logged in and signed up. It said it would be available on all linked devices. I watched a few episodes and now can't find it on Amazon Prime on my TV. When I searched for it, Food Network Shows came up but now what I had signed up for. I tried to watch it on Prime on my phone but it asked me to pay. Very frustrating.",Yes
"Frustrating. I use to love this app until I updated it. Now I can't get into my account, it tells me it's pending. Very annoying",Yes
How else can I buy your Product? I cannot support Amazon censoring their Client unfairly.. See Above and unable to find to use.,Yes
Food Network. unable to view shows w/o paying fee!,Yes
Subscription. Shows are outdated. Iím not paying for it twice. Once through here and if I want to watch requests to pay for season or episode or which service I have.,Yes
"App does not work. Upon selection of a program, the app goes into thinking mode and all I get is a spinning circle. I Am unable to watch anything and Amazon is unable to solve the problem.",Yes
poor..a waste of coin. This app crashed my kindle!† Can't get my kindle to reboot..black screen.† Now what I wonder.† Want my coin back and to remove this app!,Yes
"Can't get it to work. I downloaded this app so that I could 'draw' on my Kindle.† Every time I tried to use it, it pointed me to a game.† So I deleted it!",Yes
This is pointless. I have small hands and still can't do a lot on here. You cannot draw small items. I did half a portrait before realising I could not do the eyes. This would be better for a stylus.,Yes
Two Stars. Worked when first down loaded but within a short time quit working...my be my problem on Kindle not sure.,Yes
Hard to usr. You can't print direct from app,Yes

"Won't even install for me. Have tried to install this on both my Kindle Fire HD and my Fire Phone.† On both it goes through the download then starts to install, but a couple of seconds later it gives an error message saying there was a problem installing.† Not sure why it does this.Another reviewer says it is just a re-badging of Printhand Mobile Print.† I have Printhand Mobile Print Premium already installed.† Don't know if this is the reason Print Hammermill won't install for me, but it's the only thing I can think of.† Guess I won't be finding out if there are any improvements in Print Hammermill over Printhand Mobile Print Premium.† Oh well.",Yes
While it recognized the printer (HP Officejet 5740) and gave .... While it recognized the printer (HP Officejet 5740) and gave the command to print... the printer was unable to communicate back to the software,Yes
One Star. Still unable to get.work.,Yes
"It doesn't work. Awful, don't buy this.† It's supposed to be free but when one goes to print, it requires an upgrade which is not free.† I purchased the upgrade and it wouldn't print and kept asking for the upgrade which had already been purchased.† Tech support is useless.† They told me to install and reinstall, which I did (about 10 times) and it still didn't work, still asked for the upgrade, and then they wanted my receipt from Amazon.† Also, I got a different person each time.† Stay away!",Yes
Doesn't work. Downloadrdd and learned that you have to pay for the update to get the driver. I did that and it prints half a page. Tried for an hour and cant figure out what is wrong.,Yes
"Doesn't Work. I have an HP printer. The app refers to a 3rd party HP download. After you download the HP app and hit print...ÖÖÖThis what happens...ÖÖÖnothing. Waste of time.

No good. Doesn't work with fire hd.,Yes
Canon MF4890 not recognized. Will not recognize a Canon MF4890 multifunction printer. Unable to use as a wireless printer from my smartphone. Please let customers know before going to the trouble of download and install to fail.,Yes

zero stars. Is there zero stars? There seems to be no way to send it to the printer. Wasted bytes.,Yes
"Hammer Print couldn't find my printer. What a waste of my time! Hammer Print seemed easy to use, but ultimately it was unable to find my Brother MFC-7860DW printer, So it didn't print.",Yes
useless. This app didn't work. It wouldn't print anything. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I thought it was a waste of time.,Yes

Waste.. Won't let me MAKE an account. Can't use it. Waste.,Yes
Worst app ever not even Snapchat don't get it. Don't get this app u can't do anything all u do is check if your not a robot,Yes
Horrible. Amazon needs to just give us snapchat. For someone who doesn't have a phone and all of my friends have snapchat I can't keep up to date with this stupid knockoff. Amazon just give us normal snapchat. And update social media apps because I get updates about a year after they come out. Update them faster.,Yes
So bad. Yo can't make an account,Yes
"Don't bother. App didn't open, blank screen, waste of time!",Yes
Complicated. Can't connect,Yes

could not use. difficult to install... unable to use,Yes
"Awful. Won't download at first, then it wouldn't install, now I've got it but can't play it. Srsly game, srsly.",Yes

"Didnít work for me!. Donít download, waste of time",Yes
DOES NOT WORK DON'T waste YOUR TIME. DOES NOT WORK,Yes
Awful. Skype used to work properly but now the person on the other end cannot hear me. Please fix this it use to be a really great app.† When you go into the settings there is no way to correct the problem. I will give it a 5 star when it's working properly again.,Yes
"complete waste of effort. Doesn't work for the kindle fire hd (lowest spec one). Spent hours googling and fiddling with settings... to no avail. Quite why Skype has failed miserably to produce even a kindle app for text chat escapes me. Come on Microsoft, sort it out!",Yes
"I just got this not too long ago, so .... I just got this not too long ago, so I could chat on the go. The only problem was in the beginning. I had some trouble logging in, mainly because it was taking forever to log in, but once that was solved its been working as well as Skype on my computer.",Yes
"Buggy on fire. I believe this app is too powerful for the base kindle fire, if you have an HD shouldn't be an issue",Yes
we were unable to connect for Christmas day. too technical for seniors,Yes
"needs an update. When I try to connect to group calls it says I need to get the ""group update"" but the kindle doesn't have any new Skype updates.Having the same problem with musical.ly it says it needs updates but there are none to be found.:-(† STEP UP YOUR GAME AMAZON!!!",Yes
"Low volume, constant crashes - install android version. Kindle version crashes constantly and volume is adjusted to be too low. Installed the android version (5.2) by installing the .apk file from the web and problem solved. I couldn't install the android version from the amazon webstore and had to enable 'install from unknown sources' in kindle settings for .apk to install.Amazon needs to either work with skype to improve kindle version or allow the installation and also recommend the android version.",Yes
"worse update. Fix Skype .... it ends my calls , it has lagged reception and it lags when I talk, its about a 4 second delay .... I can't call people either , I have to have them call me ... Cause when i call , it says connecting then drops call. And when in my Skype call it drops call randomly . And I hate this update .I'm really sad they don't fix this with so many bad reviews. Its garbage, out of all respect fix this . plenty people want the same....I think you should look into this and fix . haha real talk .",Yes
I hate it. It doesn't work. It signed me out and when I tried to sign back in it didn't let me. After I tried making a new account it said I couldn't sign in at that time even though I wasn't trying to sign in.,Yes
??. I would give Skype 5stars if I didn't have to keep on uninstalling and download. Be careful if you get this app it might log you out automatically and if you log back in if you try it will say unable to sign in then you have to uninstall it and download it again.,Yes
"gg fam. Fam, I would give this 0 stars if I could. The update sucks and I can't send images without them being files.",Yes
"Having problems at the moment.. I think the new update needs a patch because when i turn on my video in a call after a few seconds the app freezes and if i try to get back on, i cant make or receive calls. It doesnt make any noise i do call someone or get a call and its really disappointing. Is it only on the kindle? Someone needs to get this fixed.",Yes
Fine but. I was trying to make a account but it said that my network connection was down and I checked it and it was not even down I can't even make a Skype on the computer because I'm not &#34;Ineligible&#34; to registerPlz fix it I really want a Skype :(,Yes
"Just the worst. I can't believe how terrible skype is for kindle, there's a three second voice delay every time and video cuts out every couple seconds. They should be ashamed.",Yes
The new update. The new update sucks. I tried to log back in and I can't because you have to have a stupid Microsoft account.,Yes
"doesn't work right. I got Skype to talk to my friends but half the time it doesn't work, it hardly sends messages and the video chat makes my kindle shut off.",Yes
"HORRIBLE UPDATE. I always use Skype but the thing is in group calls,I can't put my webcam on or see my friends webcams.",Yes
Why update why!. Before the update it worked great but now I can turn the volume down and I can't get any pictures!!!† }:-(,Yes
awful. This app doesn't work for kindle. It has decent video for about a minute then crashes and won't work again. Total BS.,Yes
"keeps crashing in my kindle fire. This new update doesn't work and keeps crashing in my device. Please solve the problem, I cannot even log into my account. It's annoying",Yes
"The app works great for reading and annotating PDFs.† I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1, and I'm finding it fairly intuitive to use the tools to mark up PDFs with the stylus.† But there is a bug or some other problem that has caused me a big headache.† Twice, my marked-up document has disappeared from storage, causing me to have to redo hours' worth of work.† This happened with two different documents.† I carefully saved after each change I made, and I made note of the file name and location, but the next day, in each case, the file was completely gone.† I searched through my entire file system and did not find it, and the storage location itself (PDFMax folder on the internal storage card) had been wiped.Until I find an alternative app, I am saving to my Dropbox account, which is slower and very clunky, and apparently has not saved the changes I re-made after losing the original file.† I really need an app that will reliably save changes and not delete files.† I thought this was it.† It is not.† Too bad, because other than that big deal-breaker, it works very well.",Yes
"Has a lot of good features. I'm not going to go over them as that's pointless; you can read the description of product or look at other reviews.I'm using a Samsung 8 inch tablet so for some reason when in landscape(horizontal) mode, the view is zoomed in too much so I often have to scroll down a little bit to see text at the bottom of my lecture notes. I cant zoom out so that the entire slide fits the height of my screen.† This is not a problem when in vertical mode though, everything is smaller (as expected), but that's why I prefer to edit in landscape mode. When switching from horizontal to vertical mode (vice versa) it teleports your view to somewhere else on the slide and zooms in...this is really annoying especially when annotating/editing.While free hand draw is amazing for writing out text with a stylus, however, the most important feature: typed text option(they call it freetext) does not even come close. The font color default is white...annoying when your first typing out text. The textbox that forms around the typed text is too big, I hate having to resize it to size of text, should make it automatic like in Adobe PDF. The fill in background color option for the textbox is extremely buggy especially when viewing in edit mode. The color wheel is weird and doesn't properly show no color option. There are no options to change type of font, font size, or highlight/underline (etc) the text you've typed out.There's no ""save as"" option though there is a backup option before each initial edit. The only way to save your file is when you exit the pdf.I can't tap to turn the page, only swiping can do that right now. They should add in the option of ""viewing mode"" aka full screen mode or maybe just have an area of the screen where I can just tap to turn page instead of bringing up the annoying edit UI.Any edit you make on this app does not do well with other pdf apps such as Adobe PDf app as mentioned by another reviewer. The edits are not visible on Adobe PDF. Not sure if the edits are shown on the computer.They should add more options so I can customize it to my liking.I think I'll stick with the native Adobe PDF app to annotate my lecture notes for now because it's simple and reliable.",Yes
"I got a new tablet with Marshmallow.† Apparently the app has been abandoned, because I get ""invalid file"" every time I try to read a file into the app.† This is not just a tablet problem, because I just checked my phone that has Marshmallow, and that also gives the same message.",Yes
"Seeing as how this app is as expensive as many office suite apps I was expecting a bit more.† Yes it does annotations.† It is clunky and crashy and what is worse you can't save a file natively.† You can export it to Dropbox which is a good save alternative but that should remain an alternative.† The best I could manage as a work around is sending it to myself as a ""share to email"" and then saving the attachment.Features I would like to see from an app this expensive but not currently available:Save locallyPrint support (specifically google's cloud print)Print annotations to PDFI'm sure I could think of a few more but these would make a far better app.",Yes
"App doesn't work. It hasn't for the longest time, over 12 months. Not maintained by developer and no response to crash reports. Invalid email and no WEB SITE. I'm on Android 8.0 Oreo on HTC 10 unlocked. Been over 12 months I tried, gave it a chance with new update to OS.. no luck, it still sucks. UNINSTALL ASAP",Yes
"Like others, I began receiving the ""invalid file!"" message when attempting to open any pdf file with PDF Max Pro after upgrading to Marshmallow. I recently upgraded to Nougat and sadly the issue persists. What was once a very useful app now serves no purpose whatsoever. I guess I finally need to give up hope and uninstall it. Time of death March 4, 2017 11:39.",Yes
DO NOT WASTE YOUR $4.00. APP DOESN'T EVEN OPEN. Why is there no refund option like on regular Android devices. SCAM!!!!!!!,Yes
Never opens and will not open any pdfs.† Waste of money.† Please remove this app from the AppStore!,Yes
"Adding strikethrough or underline to a document repeatedly gives ""Unfortunately, PDF Max has stopped.""Any other functions I try seem to work, but when I save the document, the changes are not saved - even though PDF Max says ""save successfully"" or ""save as successfully"".Nice concept, but not worth using if the changes are not saved!",Yes
I scanned a multiple page document at work.† When I opened it in PDF Expert the document was unreadable because the pages were offset such that it looked like the scan started half way through the page. At first I thought there was a page sizing issue but I opened the scan in a different PDF reader at the pages displayed correctly so the issue is with PDF Expert. I have other PDFs that displayed properly in PDF Expert but I may as well stick with my other PDF reader that works for all my PDFS.,Yes
"Really want to like this app. Highlighting/annotating is very quick and intuitive on the Kindle Fire HDX (compared to the Adobe Reader app), but will not email annotated PDF's or send them to DropBox. Every time I try, the app crashes and I am told ""PDF Max has stopped working."" In short, no annotations I make are saved properly. Needs an accessible save button that will back up the updated file on the tablet.",Yes
"I find this little app very easy to use. However, I have a major issue with it on my galaxy tab S. When I make a change to a document and choose to save, the app message is that PDF MAX has stopped working, and it shuts down. I was able to use the stamp feature to insert an image and save that.† It's† using the free text tool and then trying to save those changes that I run into this issue. I've† tried save, and save as, and different locations, as well as the default location with no luck.",Yes
It is impossible to use this app. There seems to be no way to navigate to where my documents are. A total scan and waste of money!,Yes
"From some time the app shows invalid file when trying to open almost any PDF, I used to love the app and reinstalled hoping they fixed the problem, it doesn't work!!!",Yes
Dont work!!!!!!!!!!!! Trash!!!!!!! My money† back!!!!! I can't return.,Yes
"I have used this app a few times and enjoyed the functionality. The problem is that it crashes just as much as it works.† Great concept or not, the app has to run without crashing!† Will give it a 4 or 5 when they fix the issue.",Yes
"For $8, I had expected more. Maybe it is the operating system (Android), but this is a poor product. Many free ones that are similar and even better.Don't waste your money.† Also my old windows tablet and phone have better PDF apps",Yes
Why am I forced to look at this obnoxious tool bar when I'm trying to read a PDF? there is no obvious way to hide this thing! I can't rate it higher than one star because it useless for reading PDFs!,Yes
I should have believed the reviews. Crashes on everything that I try to open. Waste of money. Big disappointment!,Yes
Don't like the fact that you can't change the font size or turn to night time view. When you let it read for you you can't move it forward you have to wait for it to get to the part you want.,Yes
"I don't read that many PDF files period, much less on a smart phone or notepad. But at $8 for the app, and it being free today, I figured it was worth a look. And my first look was unimpressive. Really? No one could take the time to write an introduction or some basic instructions? For $8? This is a perfect example of why I don't buy apps I can't try.I would suggest to the developer to include a sample PDF document, so that when you open the app, you can see that it actually works. Better yet, use that sample PDF document as a mini-tutorial.I've been working with computer technology since the 1980s and can certainly figure how to work this app. But I like to speak up for those less experienced and made to feel stupid because they can't figure something out...when the real problem is not the user but the software.",Yes
"This app is useless since it will not connect to any Cloud service to import documents.† Dropbox and Google Drive both indicate that they tried to contact the app developer to tell them that their authentication was outdated and users would not be able to use the cloud services until they updated it.† Who knows how long ago that was.† In the technology world, this is business suicide. I made the mistake of paying for this app and it doesn't even work for what I need it for.† So don't waste your money.† Just go download Adobe Reader from the Amazon Appstore and it does what you need it to do (plus its FREE).",Yes
"The application has several interface problems and is not usable for my main type of annotations using free text. Hard to add, edit, reposition free text. With fast typing, the app canít catch up and letters disappear. Removing annotations is painful. Many other usability issues. I recommend professional usability testing. Given many other free apps with the same functionality (including Adobeís), there is no justification paying for this one. Hope, future versions will do a better job.",Yes
App doesn't work properly on my Kindle Fire HDX.† When first installed it worked.† After I closed & reopened the app it stopped working..† When I open a document it closes the app.† Uninstall & reinstall made no difference.,Yes
"Every time I attempt to open a PDF file, I receive an *invalid file!* notice, and then the app immediately closes. Call me crazy, but I'm pretty sure PDFs are what this app is made for. I have tried multiple PDF files, all with the same results. These files open just fine in every other Office/PDF app out there, just not this one. I have even uninstalled and then reinstalled twice, with no luck. I have tried contacting customer support, but have not received a reply. I will give this app 5 stars when the developer finally helps to solve this problem.",Yes
"It's a great app, maybe the best for pdf docs, but, I have problems with my bookmarks, every time I close the app and open it again, I loose all my bookmarks, is really frustrating",Yes
"Sometime ago it just stopped working. Whenever I try to open any file, it just closes the app. I can open the app with no doc, but as soon as I try to load one it closes. Same thing happens when you try to use it from another app (such as opening a doc from email). Used to be good. Now useless!",Yes
This app works really well except when you close it it creates a blank notification that you can't remove (HTC One M7). I really hope this gets fixed.,Yes
still some problem,Yes
Program doesn't work.† Contact with company through email an website failed.,Yes

Tried for 20 minutes to get past this roadblock (to see the start of the archived event we were trying to watch), finally just gave up. We were using a FireStick to stream on our TV. Problem wasn't internet connection (we tested the speed).",Yes
"TOTALLY USELESS without cable subscription. I was intrigued when I installed the app and it let me watch live sports without logging in with a provider. Then it stopped 12 hours later after the preview period ended. Now it won't let me watch ANYTHING without a cable subscription.As a cord NEVER (I have never had cable so I am not technically a ""cord cutter"") this app is COMPLETELY and TOTALLY USELESS to me. Why not let me PAY YOU MONEY DIRECTLY with a subscription so I can watch your content? Why are you turning away money? Your incremental costs are negligible.",Yes
Waste of time and effort. I got this because where I live I do not have access to cable and satellite is too expensive.† I do however have high speed internet through a program with ATT.† it is their home phone with added internet.† This internet is only available to rural households that do not have access to cable.† I only get 50 gigs but it is enough for now.Anyway once app is installed you get about 5 minutes preview then you have to sign up....No problem I thought...Wrong.† When you sign up you have to sign in with your cable tv provider.† That is ridiculous.† If I had a cable tv provider I would have Fox and not need this app...† what the hell is the purpose,Yes
"HORRIBLE APP: DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. Downloaded the app to watch the WORLD CUP and it was just HORRIBLE! The quality isnít great, the screen freezes every 5 seconds. It was such a waste time going through the process of downloading the app as I had to go back to my regular HDMI TV to watch World Cup. Plus, I missed a portion of the game to download the app!! Horrible!! FOX SPORTS GO please do something about this immediately!",Yes
"Audio/video lag makes frustrating viewing. When first opening the app, it takes a while for the videos to start up. Once a video is playing, specifically the live videos, there is a lag between the audio and video. The audio is about 3 seconds ahead of the video. This makes it very frustrating to watch because you hear fans cheering or announcers saying something and you canít even see what they are talking about until 3ish seconds later. I have had no issues with any other live video steaming on the fire stick, and have not had an issues with Fox Sports Go on any other streaming device.",Yes
"Error Code 403-PA1000. I tried to watch the Boise State game on 11-12-20, got this error message. ""Subscription has limited access to our content""! Could no find how fix this problem or if the problem is fixable.",Yes
"Could be better. The stream would cut in & out randomly, sometimes it just stopped showing a still picture for up to 10 to 30 seconds during the hight of the Deltona 500 race. Upsetting at times!",Yes
"No Help. I am still unable to activate this even after speaking with four chat helpers, four different phone calls to Fox, Firefox, amazon and prime. If I don't get resolution I am going to cancel all my subscriptions to Amazon and others. I have spent three days trying to get this resolved and all I get are ""canned responses"" by e-mail, which I followed numerous times to no avail. If you are going to help, then do it, don't just say you are always available to help.",Yes
Waste my time.. Still need to type in the cable provider so doesnít matter. Donít waste time if you only have internet and not cable tv package.,Yes
"Low volume issues. Occasionally will not load-gets stuck on ""warming up"" screen- and requires an uninstall/reinstall when this happens.† Biggest issue is the low volume.† All other streaming apps on this device have no volume issues but this app is very low..until a commercial comes on.† Commercials are way louder than any game I've watched on this app.",Yes
Frustrated. Canít get it to work.† It keeps wanting me to sign in thru the fire stick to my tv provider which is Amazon.† There is no Amazon listed in the selection on the fox sports† website.† Have never had this issue with any of the other fire stick apps.† Hmmm,Yes
Never connected. Worthless unless you have a cable connection. DSL providers are either not listed or refuse service when you attempt to connect. Wasted two hours trying everything suggested to access.,Yes
"Awful, constantly drops and reloads. Just terrible.. Awful, constantly drops and reloads. Just terrible.† It's not my internet as all of my other Apps work with out any issue at all!",Yes
"Total Crap. Same ""no internet connection issue"" as noted by others.† Please fix this!Is Amazon and Fox completely ignorant and stupid to ignore so many users!This app simply does not work on Firetv 4k and I am assuming all the other fire platforms.† This is crap, fix already!† Amazon are you listening?† Fox are you listening?† About ready to give up on all of it.† So frustrating.",Yes
you can't log in without a TV provider. I can't rate it because you can't view it unless you have a TV provider which I don't. why do you think I got rid of cable because it is too expensive!!! I only wanted this to be able to view a game if needed,Yes
I canít watch much. I donít know if itís because of my cable provider but I canít watch much. I try to put on the champions league games and Iím unable to see them.,Yes
"Glitchy quality, unable to rewind/fast forward. I just got a new fire tv cube and this app runs far worse on it than it does natively on my roku smart TV. The quality drops in and out and buffers often and there seems to be no way to fast forwards or rewind, only to jump in ten second increments which is infuriating to say the least.",Yes
PPV is Terrible Don't Buy. Purchased a PPV fight via firestick and was not able to watch any of the fights due to error codes and no live customer service to resolve issues timely probably due to so many others experiencing similar issues.† I promptly requested a refund.,Yes
Does not work.. On my Kindle Fire it shuts down as soon as it boots up.† It has worked previously.† I cleared data and cache and even deleted it and reinstalled.† Still doesn't work.,Yes
You can't watch an entire game!. Only got to watch first half of the Michigan Ohio game. Then I was locked out unless I went through my cable provider which I don't have. So I was unable to watch the 3rd & 4th quarters of the game. If I had cable I wouldn't be streaming.Y,Yes
"Worthless!. Tried to open the app, got a prompt to download an update that does not exsist. Deleted all and reinstalled multiple times as still continue to get prompts to update. Total waste of time and effort!",Yes
What a waste of time. wanted to watch game on BTN and had Fox sports on sling tv so I installed it. When I tryed to watch it it said I didnt have the authority to do so.† Waited a day and and tried to watch replay and same thing. What a huge waste of time. You get a special app that allows you to see what you cant watch.,Yes
Unable to stt. I could not access the channel,Yes
Your Fire stick is no good And outdated. I could not use the product or any other products I tried getting through your amazon fire stick† !!!!it tells you to go on line and enter a code then they waste your time asking you to enter anew codes and in the end they tell you there is an error!!!!! What a waste of time !!,Yes
It wonít come in - we have satellite rather than .... It wonít come in - we have satellite rather than cable and live in a rural area. For us it was not worth the frustration or the money each week!99,Yes
"Video lags 1 to 2 seconds behind audio. Every time I try to watch a MLB game, the video lags 1 to 2 seconds behind the audio.† I have rebooted the device multiple times with no luck.† The fire stick is just two feet away from my wireless router, so distance is not an issue.",Yes
"never loads. Doesn't work at all for me.† It just says ""loading"" and nothing ever comes up.† Don't waste your time on this.",Yes
Would not except provider. Unable to get without cable provider,Yes
Waste of space and time. Cannot use,Yes
Waste of time. It sucked you need to have an account with fish to use it.,Yes
Unable to open. Unable to watch it,Yes
you need to have a cable supplier. they dont tell you that you have to have a cable supplier until you waste time downloading and setting up. If I had cable why would I need fire tv???,Yes
Fast Forward is USELESS!. Fast forward is useless. Playstation Vue stopped the stream with 2 innings left so I decided to finish on the app. You cant fast forward more theb10 seconds at a time? WTF?,Yes
"Audio and Video playback not in sync. Audio is 1-5 seconds ahead of video when viewed on Amazon Fire Stick. It was frustrating during the World Series, and is frustrating again during the NFL playoffs. We have 2 devices and it is an issue on both. It isnít a bandwidth problem (we tested). We restarted the app and the device, both to no avail. Itís a real disappointmentto hear a touchdown before you see it.",Yes
"Not worth your time. I've never once been able to access a game on my Fire Stick.† I enter the activation code on my desktop, and correctly enter my provider information, with the website saying it's activated.† However, anytime I re-open the app, it keeps giving me a new activation code.† This is such a waste of a download and time.",Yes
Try something else. Couldnít watch a game. Waste of time.,Yes
"App wont activate. Wont let me activate the app for my firestick. Everything works fine when I enter the activation code online, but the app never activates. So frustrating to waste time on this.",Yes
"Sucks because I subscribe to Fox Sports 2 Go. Sucks because I subscribe to Fox Sports 2 Go, and I can't watch any games with this app on Amazon Fire TV.† Guess I will be still using Chromecast...",Yes
I was unable to get it to work.. I was unable to get the app to work.† I tried multiple times on multiple devices with no success,Yes
Waste of Time!. Totally a waste of time.† Does not work in our area and you don't find that out until you download the app!,Yes
Tried to use while in Chicago over the Thanksgiving Holiday .... Tried to use while in Chicago over the Thanksgiving Holiday and was unable to connect . Would not accept my established password .,Yes
"WHY DID I GET A FIRESTICK?. When you get code and enter it, you then have to pick provider.† Yep, my provider doesn't work with this. Trying to save money, and it's frustrating.",Yes
Doesn't work with Dish Network. Since my service provider is Dish Network and this doesn't work work it I must give only 1 star. That is the only take away: useless for Dish Network customers.,Yes
not worth it. App won't let me select Xfinity/Comcast to log in. Waste of time.,Yes
Won't work on a TV.. Can't get it to work on the tv!! Missed the game this past weekend,Yes
... communications can't be used for getting the programs I like?. For some weird reason Cox communications can't be used for getting the programs I like?,Yes
waste of time. would not activate,Yes
i was unable to watch the game that i wanted .... i was unable to watch the game that i wanted.† it kept asking for a tv provider info.† i currently do not have a tv provider,Yes
Terrible app!!. Constantly freezes!! Very frustrating. They need to fix this problem.,Yes
Awful. Not working on my fire stick. Gives a link but still doesn't work. Awful,Yes
One Star. Couldn't watch cowboys game because of where i live...my brother who was an hour away watched no problem..what gives??,Yes
Hate this. Can't get into the app,Yes
"Don't waste the memory. Not user friendly; I gave up after a few minutes. Can't get Fox that isn't local, the only reason you would probably want to plug in an HDMI to watch football.",Yes
it required membership. unable to view,Yes
Is useless. It doesn't work,Yes
Horribel. Buffer issues and stops in the middle of a game saying it's over.,Yes
"Worst App!. This app never allowed us to choose Comcast as the provider, it works great on my iPad but deleting from fire tv, what a waste!",Yes
Two Stars. Froze a lot worked well other than that but that was a big issue,Yes
cable required. Cable subscription required. This app is useless for me. One star because I can't give zero.,Yes
"Terrible app and service. Terrible app and service.† The only one I have ever experienced that was worse was SlingTV.† Both buffer constantly, freeze, and require reboots often.† I ordered this to watch NBC Sports Network so I was seeing all the 2018 Winter Olympics.† Don't count on watching your favorite competition without lots of interruptions.† I literally couldn't watch a single Luge run (all under one minute runs) without it buffering at least once if not more often.That's truly pathetic.† We have a stable and speedy connection and have no issues with amazon prime, netflix, youtube, and a myriad of other streaming types of content.If you're looking for a streaming service app, this one is a real drag.† Don't subscribe to these folks...† Run, don't walk away...",Yes
"Cable company like channel bundling and laughable DVR concept. Everybody hates cable companies and their practice of forcing customer to pay for bundles of channels just to get one or two that they really want. Now with fuboTV it seems they are trying to extend that practice to online streaming. All I want is the cycling channel but fuboTV requires me to signup up for their fuboPremier bundle (at $34.99/month) just to be able to add cycling channel (another $8.99/month). You'd think that with a demise of cable industry they would have learned their lesson.Second, their concept of ""DVR"" is laughable. With all the past shows stored on their servers (in the ""cloud"") - why is it that I need to actually mark future shows to record? Why can't I just go and watch any past episode that I missed? What is it, year 1998? Seems like another attempt by cable companies to screw up their customer and make it as hard as possible to get what I want.",Yes
"There's a Sneaky Catch to This Service.. I think FuboTv is a very good service that provides great channels, including MSG so I can watch my Devils lose mercilessly every other day, BUT!!!!! Beware, there's a sneaky stipulation to their service.† You are unable to stream FuboTV on 2 devices at the same time if you are on 2 different wifi networks.† Example: my sister has a house and I have a house.† The home network is my house, therefore if she wants to watch fubo on a roku/firestick/ smart tv app/ apple tv / xbox at her house while im watching it at my house it is not allowed. This rule only applies to TV Devices.† So in that case she or I would need to stop using the firestick to watch fubo and start watching on our phones or laptops.† Extremely inconvenient for people using the same account in 2 different homes.† I spoke to fubo about it and they said there's nothing they can do and it's part of their contract.They need to make it so that we can pay maybe like $5 extra per month to add a TV Device outside of the home network cuz this is going to make me cancel their service.",Yes
Do not waste your time. I gave it a 1 so I could write the review. I have tried two other streaming services and had minimal issues. This is by far the worst thing I have ever tried. Couldn't watch at all. Over a 2 day period nothing would play.,Yes
"Has some little annoyances. Like a strange little 5 second repeat that makes you feel like thereís a glitch in the matrix.† It also will just randomly stop in the middle of a show and say it canít play the requested video at the moment...try again later.† I have a brand new Samsung, unlimited internet and none of our other streaming services have these odd occurrences.† Also, I wish it had more 4K programming.† After football seasonís over, weíll need to reassess.",Yes
I'm ditching FuboTv and going to Hulu January 2020. Both of my subscriptions were just pre-paid for January but I'm getting rid of Fubo on January 24. The product was ok but had issues with subscriptions from day one. I held on for five months now but am sick and tired of when they update their software that I have to go through and reactivate most of the channels that are included. My current configuration is Firestick TV 4K with Fubo and Sling Orange for ESPN. I should have dropped both of these in September and stuck with Hulu only. I have had multiple FuboTv issues with my subscription especially Showtime and wasn't able to receive or activate multiple channels for weeks. FuboTv SOFTWARE IS BROKEN and desperately needs to be fix.,Yes
"Refund Difficult. Poor picture,,,,constant streaming delays...looking for way out of my free tria. and it appears...as usual to be ""obscured"" and hard to do.† OMG.† It is the standard ""free trial"" trap!† I finally figure out where the opt out was....so I raised the review to 3 stars.† The only other issue I have is price.† I can add the channels on cable/satellite (that I want to watch) for the same price or less.† Value is not there.",Yes
"Fine if you don't have cable. A long way to go before I cut my cable.† Very clutsy interface and not user friendly.† Had lots of pixilation and drop in picture quality.† Support is poor.† NO ABC so my wife hated it.† Some of the games I wanted to watch were not available but I could stream them on my iPad.† Cloud service is basic and problematic -- can't fast forward while recording in session, cant programs until they are scheduled.Thought I hated my cable until this!",Yes
"At least 50% of the time you want to use .... At least 50% of the time you want to use it, it will error saying† ""Sorry. We can't play this content at this time.""",Yes
"Avoid this, wait until work out the bugs. Terrible performance.. Awful feed, choppy and freezes constantly. Sling doesn't do this on the same internet connection, Direct TV doesn't do this either. Also, the DVR just doesn't work. I couldn't watch a single match.",Yes
"Buffering issues. Interface is great. easy to use but im having some buffering issues. i dont have this type of problem with other steaming services like netflix, hulu, etc but i guess maybe the difference is this is live TV? it was terrible while watching the superbowl. my kids are getting frustrated also while watching their shows Nick jr, etc. likely going to cancel.",Yes
"So very frustrating!. I was unable to set up app via Fire TV, so I went online to set up and tried to log in.† I can not get past the initial page explaining charges.† It simply spins and says signing in.† I was eager to use this to catch international matches, but I guess I will have to go to other sources",Yes
"Constantly loses signal.. Paying $44 a month for fubo is ridiculous. It plays the selected channel for about 1 minute before it loses signal and I have to exit out to the main screen and reload the selected channel. I shouldnít have to do that with amount of money Iím paying. It makes no sense that when it loses signal, it will not regain it again unless I reload the channel. I know itís not my internet because I donít have problems with any other devices. Very unhappy.",Yes
Don't waste your time. I would have given zero stars if that was an option. Everything was in Spanish and I couldn't figure out how to switch it to English. I called the customer service number (which is automated) and it said it couldn't find my account. I cancelled it within 30 minutes of starting. Save yourself the headache. Don't waste your time. There are plenty of other options that work.,Yes
"has buffering issues. Tried watching sports, hgtv and a movie. In each case, one of two things would happen every 5-10 minutes1. video freezes while audio continues, then video ""jumps"" to the current location of the audio. You miss several seconds of video2. video and audio repeat the last several seconds of what you watched. So, as you're watching a show, suddenly you're rewatching the last 5 seconds or so. It happens quite oftenNB: have a dedicated 60 mpbs internet line; watching via FireTV Stick, located about 3 feet from the router. No other devices consuming wifi or internet at the time.I've since read that this is an issue with FuboTV. I don't experience these problems with Netflix, Prime video, Hulu, Youtube or when casting from a mobile deviceThat being said, the interface is horrible. I preferred my MediaOne (or whatever it was in those days) cable interface in the 90's to this. No search capability at all. Can't continue to watch a show while scrolling for another. No last channel or favorites concepts. So, in 2 days, prior to the end of the trial, I'll switch to Sling and compare.",Yes
"Product Sucks. Never could get the service working. downloaded app, then setting it up it wouldn't take my credit cards.. now I can't delete it. Sick of these BS apps and setups",Yes
"Did not like the user interface. Very annoying to watch part of a movie and then to come back later and not have that movie resume at the point you stopped.† Happened more than one and the forward feature was ""unavailable"".† Not my cup of tea.",Yes
"I can't get it to work. It keeps asking me to sign in, does not, will not recognize any email I provide. Will not allow me to set up an acct. Useless app as far as I am concerned. Going to uninstall it.",Yes
Unsatisfatory. Never able to stream it. Am not inter stead in it. Too much trouble and Amazon Customer Service could not help or resolve the problem. I do not want to subscribe to it.,Yes
"Cuts out of what it is airing-not worth the $$.. Was consider changing from Hulu since price was going up but and this offered NFL.† Picture had a slight lag and Fubo stopped showing the game when there was 5 minutes left at the end!† Tried to go back and Fubos app said game had ended and it hadnít!† If thatís the way they air, I dint want it -so cancelled!!!",Yes
Poor Signal Constant Scolling :-(. Poor streaming signal quality.† I have Netflix and Amazon Prime movies and have no problems viewing movies without weak signal scrolling.† With FuboTV movies and recordings I find that viewings are constantly being interrupted by a weak signal and constant scrolling.† Not happy at all.† I'm thinking of terminating my service.,Yes
"Error trying to use FUBO.TV with FireTV. After having worked for about a week, this week we are not able to watch any of Fubo.tv on our TV through FireTV stick. I am able to watch on my laptop with no issues and each time I try the FireTV I get the error: ""Sorry we are not able to play this content ...""† For all shows. If not working after one day I will cancel my Fubo.TV.",Yes
"Good idea, stream is lousy at times.. Hi,Got this for Il Giro. The picture streaming is lousy at times and locks up. I've checked my service, tv, etc. PlayStationVue didn't have these issues. Fix this and you'll have a customer for longer than a month.",Yes
Live stream kept buffering.. Purchased to watch an out of region game on NBA TV. The game was blocked out on PS Vue. Great that we were able to get the game but the stream buffered every 30 seconds. Very annoying. My internet is 100mb down on fiber. My device was hard wired. I donít ever have buffering issues when streaming other apps. The first 7 days were free and I will be canceling before Iím charged.,Yes
Poor streaming. Had high hopes but just constant buffering issues.,Yes
Unable to open. I can't open the app!! It keeps telling me that I don't have an account. And prompts me to purchase the app again.,Yes
Smtt. Waste of time could not get it to work,Yes
HELP!!! want Yankee games. Unable to receive Cox sport.com† need assistance now!!! Thanks David Austin,Yes
One Star. Unable to use without cable. No way to subscribe,Yes
One Star. Deleted right after install. unable to use until Fox and Verizon settle!!! If ever,Yes
Football blackouts still apply.. I am in a different state and wanted to watch the pre-season game for my home football team that happened to be playing the team for the state I was visiting.† It picked-up on my location and wouldn't let me watch due to blackout rules for the location where I was. Waste of my time.,Yes
too expensive. very inclusive lineup but most of which i could care less. why can't i pick just the channels i want and just pay for them. why is the channel lineup so bloated with channels nobody watches. what a racket!,Yes
"It's just a useless to have and I can't see it. The only way I can write a review is by picking at least one star, which it doesn't deserve.† Not by fault of the app, but to Amazon. The reason I don't have cable is because of the high prices, but yet Amazon requires you to sign in a cable/satellite user provider.† If anything, you should be allowed to use you internet sign on to access any app you have listed.† It's just a useless to have and I can't see it.† Get with the program Amazon.",Yes
"useless app, activation code comes on the screen on .... useless app, activation code comes on the screen on Tv and you enter it into your laptop, then it says you need another code so you type that in, can't get past this using Amazon Fire TV box. After 3 dAY OF trying I deleted it. I installed the app on my table and it works. I have installed 30 something apps on the fire tv box, this is not my first rodeo",Yes
"Not worth the effort. Olympic coverage is constantly buffering, even during the commercials. And when content is playing, half the time the screen is so blurry it's practically unwatchable. All of these problems occur even though I have average speeds of ~150Mbps, so the bandwidth problem is on NBC's end. Additionally, the app interface is repetitive and difficult to navigate to the content I want to actually see.",Yes
"waste.... If you don't have cable, or your cable subscription doesn't include NBCSN, you can't stream content from NBCSN† on this app. If you have cable, you probably have a cable-company app on your device, so you don't need this anyway.",Yes
"Pixelated POS. Absolute waste of money. We pay for the NBC Sports Gold so we can watch bike and track (and the olympics). The app never retains our filters or preferred settings. Volume doesnít stay constant when switching to commercials - oh yeah, commercials! The same ones over and over and over... The app will randomly crash on occasion (at the worst moments!! And then you have to start the video all over again) and is pixelated (not an internet issue, all other apps/streaming work fine). Very frustrating.",Yes
"App is extremely limited vs browser version. A sporting event I am watching through my computer browser on the NBC Sports stream site shows as unavailable on the app. For some reason, the app doesn't show anything that's not on your local NBC channel. I'm trying to watch a nationally televised game, but my local NBC channel is showing a local game instead. Skip the app and use the browser, but only if you must. If you can watch the event on ANY other platform than NBC, use that instead.",Yes
"Worthless. I have Time Warner for basic channels, but don't want to pay a ton for channels I won't need.† Turns out, since I don't subscribe to the package that includes a bunch of garbage channels that also includes NBC Sports, I can't use this app. I know it's a CYA for the providers so they can keep people attached to cable, but I'm just going to cancel it all and get one of these small internet only providers for a quarter of the price if I can't watch on here. Look at all the add revenue they're missing on the Olympics by blocking anyone without a higher tier sports package.",Yes
"Free preview time limits. I wanted to see if I could get the Sunday night NFL game.† I can never get NBC on the airwaves in Orlando, FL.† No problem with the other networks.† You get 45 minutes free, but if you log out, the timer keeps going, which SUCKS!!",Yes
I am unable to access the program... .... I am unable to access the program......Hence I am unable to provide a review............it appears it is not viewable in my area.† How can I resolve this issue and view this program?NB This is not the only program I am unable to view.....some of your programs I cannot view or download even if I offer to purchase them for rentalRegardsDavid,Yes
"Not useful to watch sports on.† Very frustrating.. Very inconsistent and frustrating to watch sports on.† Videos regularly don't load or hang midway through.† Also requires payment to, in theory, watch a limited selection of heavily curated videos.",Yes
"Buffering issue. Watched the nascar race yesterday using my amazon fire stick. Not sure if the constant buffering was nbc, or the device, but I saw the race...",Yes
"Can't seem to broadcast during peak times.. I'm sure other times this isn't as big a deal, but during the 2018 Super Bowl LII all I got from running the app was a generic error.† Never got it to come up and had to switch to something else to get the game going.† Not impressive for a company whose entire business is broadcasting.† If they didn't know how to do this on the internet, they should have just worked with something like Twitch.",Yes
"Can't use this app without a cable or satellite TV subscription. NBC needs to get with the program and allow people to pay a monthly fee to subscribe to their app without having to also have a paid television subscription.† Everyone is cutting the cord - we only want to buy what we want to see, and not everything else that is offered.",Yes
Awful. I am a Notre Dame fan and love Sunday night football and this app is not remotely good for streaming. I would say that about every five minutes it does the circle of death during the stream. None of the other sports apps do this. I have no problems with the Fox Sports app or WatchESPN. I don't know how this app has so many problems with the large amount of people that will stream games off of this app.,Yes
Pretty much useless and support is virtually non existent. Will not play anything except short clips.† Attempted to get assistance from NBC and they said to delete and reinstall the app.† Did that and still can't watch a full event.† Pretty much useless and support is virtually non existent.,Yes
"That sucks big time. I can't get into any NBC sports shows because I don't have a TV provider.† That sucks big time.† I really wanted to see the winter olympics. I'm actually getting sick of this same thing happening to most apps I download for free.† Why would I want to get onto the apps thru amazon firestick tv, if I had a cable company.† Re-thinking why do I need amazon firestick tv, if I need cable to get the apps on it.",Yes
Waste of time. You still need a cable subscription to use this app. What really is the point in paying for using the app then having a cable subscription. Useless garbage.,Yes
Don't waste your time downloading this app. Streaming on this app is soo slow and it also randomly closes when the stream quality gets to bad.,Yes
"Listen to your customer. Hello the Amazon user is the non cable user. This doesn't work, stop offering viewing to us that is really not available. Listen to customers and start offering new viewing that we can see on just Amazon TV.",Yes
Buffer much?! Jeez. I was really excited to see that I could stream the super bowl but sadly it was too frustrating to watch. I gave up after the halftime show which Iíd already seen by the time it aired since we were 15 minutes behind everyone else due to all of the buffering!! Grr!† I have no doubt it was the app. I stream all day long without issue so itís not my tv or internet. The app quality is subpar but at least I didnít have to pay for it.,Yes
App limits time.. So without a Cable subscription you are limited to 44 minutes of watching football so while they say you can watch the game they don't tell you that you get a tease and then you have to sign in.But you don't find this out until you download the app and start watching. So unless you have 7 devices to watch online you will never see a whole game.,Yes
Umm not good. Well ...did not enjoy this app. Keep freezing and had to switch app to app so i could watch tv. Check the internet and i had very good connection. Only had this problem woth this app. I will spend money and subscribe espn after not watching the game.,Yes
"Complete waste of time & effort!. Does not work on Firestik without an actual subscription to Fios, Spectrum or Directv.",Yes
Waste of time unless you want to spend money.. I have Spectrum and I have theses channels. The app keeps telling me that they are not included. I guess they just want you to pay them to. Donít waste your time with this app.,Yes
"Logged in... nothing works... an endless loop back to signing in.... A lot of time wasted trying to avert an endless loop being sent back, time after time, to the sign-in portal.† No picture, sound or access. Disappointed...",Yes
Setup with Fire TV is painful. Setting up fire was not straight forward. I had issues last year and gave up. I tried again this year and still had issues but kept trying.,Yes
Doesn't work. Went through whole process of registering it to my TV.† Doesn't work.† Useless.,Yes
Waste. Terrible. It gives you about 4min to watch highlights from the Olympics but they're talking most of the time so you never see anything. I'm deleting the app. It's a waste,Yes
Missed game. Was able to link with the app on the cell phone but unable to use on my tvís. Called help number and they said it was my provider issue. Not true since I could get it with my cell giving the exact information.,Yes
Pointless. What's the point of having a app if it requires you to have service through a provider?† Those of us who use streaming services are unable to watch half of the Olympics because they put it on a pay service that requires a cable or satellite provider.,Yes
"Not good! can't get it to just play it's content. Not good! can't get it to just play it's content,† these apps ask to be activated, this means I have to have a TV provider, which I don't, However, I can get to all the channels and they are not charging for them anyway but because I don't have TV provider only internet I can't activate these apps,so not Happy!!",Yes
Very Poor Excuse for a Kindle Fire app. Terrible app. Disruptive and limited functionality. Sets a short period before requiring a subscription to a cable service which is short sighted and unhelpful for those who dont want to rely on that.,Yes
"It misses the point.. In order to activate the app you have to sign in to your television provider. If I had a television provider, I would not need an app like this. It misses the point. Just provide streaming advertisement for use of this app and content as an alternative business model. Waste of time.",Yes
Horrible program. This program had so many problems playing the Olympics it is crazy. Failed to load a lot of the time then when it did it would play for about 5 mins them show the loading circle again. I would have to go out and reload it manually to get it to work again.,Yes
"Unfortunate Canuck.. Waste of time, cannot access the programming because they require the name of a television provider, Canadian providers are not recognized, pity.",Yes
"Ads, Ads, Ads, content, ads, ads, ads. More ads than content. Home screen not well organized. Poor reporting. Worse background stories. Stopped using it after about 10 minutes; 7 of which were ads.",Yes
"Very frustrating app; not good for exploration. Very frustrating. Reboots frequently, particularly when attempting to access highlight videos.† Very spotty quantity of videos, some have absolutely no commentary and the graphics are impenetrable. Fast forward doesn't work, so you can't skip to the action on replays. And the commercials pop up at random intervals, sometimes within 20 sec of the last. Generally this is a very poor experience, and entirely unacceptable way to explore sports with which you aren't familiar.",Yes
"Worthless app for watching Premier League - ""Unable to play this asset"". You can forget watching Premier League matches with this app. I get the common ""Unable to play this asset"" only on Premier League matches. All other shows play fine. I am using version 3.2 of this app. Version 4 is even worse as it just says ""An error has occured."" Worthless in every way.",Yes
Worthless!. Why offer programming that requires a cable provider?† And the free† 30 minute 'preview' of Olympics is a joke.† The point of subscribing to Prime is for watching programs and movies without the cost of a cable service... a d a delay is no problem. Would love a response from an Amazon official as to the benefits.,Yes
"makes thus app useless. amazon fire stick is how i watch things. new change to watching requirements, makes thus app useless.† amazon fire stick is how i watch things. i do not use or will not paid for cable providers.† was watching over my network provider with Amazon fire stick. now must register and have cable provider.† to use this app.† so di not waste your time with app",Yes

Sucks. Unable to even use it. Says there is an error.,Yes
"Fire Stick rejects this app. Why does Amazon have two apps here?† One says it will upload to my Fire Stick.† Yet when I try to enter the verification code for our cable TV provider, it says it can't open the app.† The app works on my phone so I know the issue is NOT my cable TV provider. The app has worked in the past and now it will not.† I tried to upload the other NBC Sports app, but that particular one has a red x by my Fire Stick option on my Amazon account and it says it will not work.† Very frustrating during these Olympic weeks.† No answers from Amazon.† I hope someone from Amazon sees this review and answers the question why my Fire Stick won't accept the app and WHY are there two separate apps on their site? I have never had trouble with other new apps that I have loaded on my Fire Stick. I believe that the issue on my Fire Stick is Amazon related.† Amazon, do you have an answer? Note the attached screenshot of the Amazon site: two apps with two different sets of reviews. One loads and won't verify as a usable app. The other won't even acknowledge my Fire Stick.",Yes
Would have been willing to pay a nominal amount like netflix. But as usual they tie you to .... Would have been willing to pay a nominal amount like netflix. But as usual they tie you to a cable or satellite provider. Worthless don't waste your time downloading the app. Deserves minus star.,Yes

"HORRIBLE, FRUSTRATING AND USELESS.. I just want to watch the French Open live and I don't have a cable subscription BECAUSE I GOT ALL THESE STUPID APPS TO REPLACE AN OVERLY EXPENSIVE CABLE PACKAGE. What is WRONG with NBC that they don't realize that the market is shifting?! This app is deeply frustrating and completely useless. Don't waste your time on it.",Yes
I thought it is free for each one to see the sporting games but why make it confusing just to get see the game and sometimes a lot f time wasted just to remember your code. I was just wonder why the code for viewing something? I thought it is free for each one to see the sporting games but why make it confusing just to get see the game and sometimes a lot f time wasted just to remember your code.,Yes
Pointless app. I keep getting the error ìunable to play this assetî. No way to get help other than emai. By the time I get a reply the game I wanted to watch will be over. Pointless app.,Yes
"so this NBC Sports app was literally a waste of my time. I do NOT subscribe to cable or satellite TV carriers. I use only a antenna for local TV programming and Amazon Fire TV for other Amazon features. The NBC Sports application ONLY works if you are a current cable or satellite customer, so this NBC Sports app was literally a waste of my time.",Yes
Don't bother unless you have cable. Can't watch more than 30 mins.. not able to actually watch the content. This is terrible.,Yes
Bad video feed and many disconnects. I had lots of issues while watching the Superbowl.† Disconnects and choppy video were just 2 of my issues.,Yes
") my problem is the terrible quality. Perfectly fine with internet and connections. Have the tv service so that's not the problem (that's just common sense, the tv providers are not going to offer FREE tv...) my problem is the terrible quality. Perfectly fine with internet and connections, but NBC can't figure out how to correctly stream a game for 5 minutes without it buffering or loading",Yes
"Useless without a cable subscription. Useless without a cable subscription. Don't really get why you would need that since it's a network channel and not a premium. Although I seem to remember that maybe there was a sports channel that you had to subscribe to. If that's what this is for, it should say that off the top before you waste time downloading it.",Yes
"Buffering. This app is TERRIBLE. It froze and buffered every few minutes and took a while to reload. A friend downloaded it as well and had the same problems, so it wasnít poor internet connection. We ended up just using Hulu Live TV. Donít waste your money.",Yes
"You need to be with a cable provider to have access to this content!!! Not just internet, A Cable Subscription, Xfinity, Direct. This is crap for the most part. Yes, this app does provide 100% access, however you have to belong to a cable provider to get access. So if you do not have cable, then there is no ""access"". just a waste of time.",Yes
"Can not use this app!. Ordered this product but every time I go to the channel, it asks for user name, password. Then go to a website where it tells me I have to order NBC sports. I've done this a hundred times with no resolution. Very frustrating! Can't use the apps I've ordered!",Yes
"Problematic. I love the wide variety of Olympic sports we can watch at any time. Unfortunately, the segments constantly pause to load which is annoying as hell. It often wonít load the app at all when you try to launch it and you have to ìRetryî multiple times before it starts finally.",Yes
"Limited coverage. I have missed the last two prime time football games with my team because this channel has been canceled in the Atlanta viewing area, please fix this!!!",Yes
"Poor performance overall. Lots of options, but the app itself is quite terrible. Quality is poor. Lots of buffering and freezing.I have 60mbsp down so would think bandwidth isn't a problem. If worked well app would be great.",Yes
One Star. this is a waste of time,Yes
"Stops streaming ALL THE TIME. Support never responds.. Your app is the best and worst app there is. My dogs love it, but it is completely buggy. It is the only app in the App Store that routinely stops working. The re-subscribe prompt doesnít work. I have to re-subscribe, delete and re-install the app to get it working again. You lost my subscription a week ago because of this after it stopped working again only a week after I re-installed it. Itís beyond frustrating. I watch on Apple TV. Epic developer FAIL. ??",Yes
"Double billed, can't get a refund and they won't fix it. I love DOGTV service and so do my animals. But they recently changed their service, and I was unable to access channel although I am being billed monthly. After several customer service emails and phone calls, they decided† I needed to create my account again, but, they strangely already had my credit card and I had to pay ahead for a year this time. NOW they refuse to fix it, telling me I paid through ROKU and have no recourse and will not get a refun. Too bad because my animals love it, but they have really frustrated and been unprofessional in refusing to help me solve this problem. Don't do it!!",Yes
Doesn't work without paying. Misleading description. Not a free software,Yes
Waste. Not worth it slows things down,Yes
"Frustrated with the occurrence of my Kindle and the app. I literally just downloaded this app. It cleaned my junk files & checked for viruses, but beware, unless u pay $3.99 the app does not let you do anything. I will update this review after I use it for alittle longer.Ok, so it's literally 3 days over a month since I paid the app upgrade......my Kindle went a little loco on me (froze up on me), so I rebooted it. Well, I may have just given the money to upgrade this app, to a complete stranger, bc I had to start from scratch again by downloading & reinstalling it. I can't even tell you anything further because all its doing is analyzing my Kindle & cleaning it.....Well, let's see what happens next, and once again, I will update my review.",Yes

Had to delete app. I never actually got to use the app so I really can't comment on it's performance.All I know is after I downloaded the app it drove mysecurity apps crazy I was unable to perform any action without receiving a pop up about the app.I am a decent tech savy individual but I couldn't get the app set to hault mysecurity apps from trying to remove it so I finally just removed the app.,Yes
"no easy to select the share or delete icon at all. FireTV:† When viewing a recorded video, button selections on the screen don't highlight when selecting them (play/pause/forward/delete/etc.), so you can't tell what you are doing.† Also, no easy to select the share or delete icon at all.† If you keep trying, the app locks up.",Yes
"Won't Connect... no ""generic"" camera setting. I bought this camera [...]. Based on the reviews, different brands/models are shipped to different people, and the one I got has absolutely no brand or model markings anywhere on the camera, included CD (and software on CD), or box. No instructions either. Using the Android app, IP Cam Viewer (a competitor for tinyCam Monitor), the camera brand and model came up automatically as ""Unknown Brand"", ""IPCAM1,IPCAM2"". Everything works perfectly in that app, connected on first try and hasn't had any problems since. I bought tinyCam Monitor Pro, since there was no way to actually try it out (the ""test drive"" amazon thing isn't going to work for actually seeing if the app will connect to a networked camera.... or at least, it wouldn't connect to mine), and I wanted to use the additional motion detection and recording features not found in IP Cam Viewer. However, I can't connect to the camera, I'm assuming since there is no comparable setting to the ""Unknown Brand"" option in IP Cam Viewer, and the app doesn't know how to communicate with it. Everything else is set the same as it is in IP Cam Viewer... same address, port, etc. I've tried all the camera brands/models that I've seen mentioned in the reviews for my camera, but I keep getting ""Video Failed (socket closed)"" and ""Video Failed (404 - not found)"" errors. So weak.",Yes
"Unreliable and irritating. Don't buy this app.I wasted $4. App crashes on Fire TV stick, shuts itself off going back to home screen of Fire TV. I bought it to be able to watch kids sleep while working on a computer in the other room.

This crashes and doesn't work,Yes
Initially connecting an iPhone using the Screen Mirroring companion App to the Fire Stick Screen Mirroring App the connection works but after a couple of minutes a message appears on the TV that there is an error described as unauthorized use. You can't get rid of that message even when you exit the Fire Stick App. The only way to get rid of the message is to actually reboot the Fire Stick. Although there is nu charge for the Screen Mirroring Fire Stick App I had to pay for the companion iPhone version which turned out to be two different applications from that company. So I have invested money in something that DOES NOT WORK. The company's answer was I had to wait for a new update in their application. They should have refunded my money for the iPhone apps.,Yes

I made sure that the MIPC app was not running on the other phone, going so far as to turn off that phone, so there would be no interference.tinyCam PRO, in its current form (Dec 15, 2020) is a fundamentally unreliable product.

"We had an original kindle fire. this app worked pretty well for awhile on there. then we had to replace due to a sound issue. Aged we got the new fire the app would lock the device up and we would have to do a hard shutdown. it never worked after that and we had multiple new devices sent to us. support from the app just said ""do not run on other devices"".

"I have 5security cameras in a closed network being displayed. There is no internet access. The software is powerful, but easy to setup at the same time.

Everything works perfectly in that app, connected on first try and hasn't had any problems since. I bought tinyCam Monitor Pro, since there was no way to actually try it out (the ""test drive"" amazon thing isn't going to work for actually seeing if the app will connect to a networked camera.... or at least, it wouldn't connect to mine), and I wanted to use the additional motion detection and recording features not found in IP Cam Viewer. However, I can't connect to the camera, I'm assuming since there is no comparable setting to the ""Unknown Brand"" option in IP Cam Viewer, and the app doesn't know how to communicate with it. Everything else is set the same as it is in IP Cam Viewer... same address, port, etc. I've tried all the camera brands/models that I've seen mentioned in the reviews for my camera, but I keep getting ""Video Failed (socket closed)"" and ""Video Failed (404 - not found)"" errors. So weak.",Yes
"Don't buy this app.I wasted $4. App crashes on Fire TV stick, shuts itself off going back to home screen of Fire TV. I bought it to be able to watch kids sleep while working on a computer in the other room. It ended up being a big pain in the ass distraction, as every time I looked at the tv screen, app was gone, and I needed to pick up remote and restart it. Sometimes it worked for 5 minutes, other time only 1 minute.",Yes
"Purchased it on fire tv, Unable to connect and monitor wyze labs cameras and doesnít not offer the mobile app, you need to purchase it again.",Yes
"First off, the motion alerts do not work unless the app is running in the background.† If the app is running, you can set it up to record automatically, but leaving it on will be at the expense of ram and battery life.I spent hours trying to get the app to work outside my home WIFI.† I figured out how to set the IP address on my camera so it is not dynamic, then figured out how to use port forwarding on my router, and had to set up a temporary DDNS address for my public IP just to make that happen.† It worked for two days, then a two second power outage reset something and I can't pull up feed on my phone anymore.† I dont feel like figuring it out at this point.The camera I'm using is a Foscam F19893P V2, for reference.The customer service is non existent.† I emailed them several times.† They only responded when I asked for a refund just to tell me I would not get one.The free foscam app that it came with works fine inside and outside my WIFI as long as my home internet is running and my phone has bars.† I wanted a a way to automatically record on motion, so I downloaded ISpy on my laptop for that.† It's a free open-source program.† Only issue is I have to leave my laptop on all the time until I come up with another solution.",Yes
"Limited group of compatible cameras, Since my† all of different IP cameras were not on the list, I found it impossible to add any of them manually.",Yes
Wasnít able to use on my action tiles. Waste of money,Yes
"I use this app on my Android and Amazon devices. I love that they support the Eufy PTZ camera which I purchased this year (2020) but I took 1 star away because you can't get audio as of yet. I took another star away because you can't pan & tilt through this app. I turned on the motion detection and I love that it zooms in and alert you in the app if there is motion, but the default settings are too sensitive because it goes off when there is no one in the room. I wish if it had the option to use the Eufy's person motion detection and sound AI crying notification. The camera also disconnects and reconnects often. Even though I mentioned many issues, it's still a good option to have at your disposal. I like that Eufy is listed so you can login rather using the RSTP method.",Yes
Works great.† Just can't see my cameras from the Internet when I'm not home.,Yes
Not working. I didn't like it. Unable to play anything,Yes

"crap, fake not ven good as a gag.. For something billed as an EVP app which in its description has a lot of gobbledygook, this app is pretty much fake.

"""Sorry, Skype doesn't work, and we won't say why"". Won't connect to the internet no matter what measures I try from the Skype ""help center"".† Worse, is that each time I try another solution, the Skype window comes up with an *animated* frowny-face, telling me it's ""sorry"", but won't give any real reason why it won't connect, or what can be done. That frowny-face really seals the disgust.",Yes
"Disgusted! Bring back the old skype please!!!!. It's hard enough being stationed overseas so far away from home, but now I can't even video chat with family. Last year I downloaded this app it worked well enough for me. Please bring back the original app! This updated version is horrible.",Yes

Thought I would be able to watch the Super Bowl however it was only available in Spanish ( commercials were English), had to place a call to them 3 times then finally was on HOLD for nearly 25 minutes just for them to tell me the ""English"" version was not available to my area. This wasn't the first issue with them, I am disgusted with Fubo, save your money because Fubo IS NOT worth the fee they charge. I subscribed but as soon as my subscription comes due I will be cancelling. No Super Bowl for us.. READ the reviews available on google, Don't waste your money on Fubo",Yes

Movie problems. movies will stop running before they are finished. Comes up on screen they are working on the problem. Disgusting.,Yes
"If youíve cut the cable, Donít bother. I agree wholeheartedly with Brian. This app is a waste of time to even download. As an exclusively OTA viewer, this app is worthless. Itís not even worth the one star I had it give it",Yes

Does not work on Kindle Fire. Unfortunately this doesn't work on the Kindle Fire we have.† The app downloads but without any images.† Sadly program is not any use without the pictures.,Yes

No longer supported. This app doesn't work anymore. It tells you to go to the website but then it says that they have shutdown due to lack of support. Way to blame the customer when you didn't get the word out about it.,Yes
"please fix it!. I was looking forward for a bit of story writing, but no, after the new update I can't even get on the app. It keeps sending back to my tablets home screen.

Courtney. Did the new upgrade as it requested and now it doesn't work at all! So mad! Lost all my receipes!! Don't download or you will lose your stuff!,Yes
"????Don't get this game????. Graphics and challenges are really good. The game is really complicated and not for younger kids at all. There is a very difficult technique to mastering the game as you rely on buildings, gear and mods that are all based on percentages and numbers. If you join a good alliance, you will learn easily what to do and start rally wars together which is a blast. My biggest complaint however and why I gave it 1 star is this. They claim in all their adds that the game is free. Which could be true except it would take you several years to build your base and gear to even remotely be able to compete in the game. Also, there are a lot of things, including gear that you absolutely can not get without spending money. If you do not spend money then you will not enjoy this game. You can't compete and you spend your entire time farming tiles (which you get attacked on) and you still won't be able to gather enough rss to complete required research, build buildings and train troops.And let's not forget the packs they offer you to buy start at $9.99 just for gold (which gets you nothing) and up to $150 packs which get you a lot. However, the more you progress, it could take upwards of 16-20 packs to complete one research tree. That's $1600-2000 dollars using the average $99 packs they offer. Total rip off for digital info they upload after your purchase. ALSO, You purchase these expensive packs and you don't receive all the items, or they disappear from your inventory when your not looking.† I caution you to not get this game as it is addicting and you will rack up credit card bills before you know it. I know a lot of people that played this game that lost control and went into serious debt. RIP OFF",Yes
"LOST in the shuffle. Too complicated to maneuver contents. Wanted to watch football , TWO games were available and customer servce rep told me the other games must be blocked from broadcast in my area....REALLY?",Yes
"Absolutly unreliable and Poor performance - Don't waste your money.. Unbelievably poor performance!! Paid account, simply spins and chokes all game long. At the end of the game it simple refuses to return from being paused. Lost almost the whole 4th quarter. Tried watching the recorded play after shutting down and restarting, clearing cache, tried other browsers, nothing worked. Finally i get it to about 20 minutes from the end of the game, and couldn't fast forward, couldn't move the slider. Then to beat everything, the game stopped recording before the end of the game.The teams wound up tying at the end of regulation. And the other team who was behind all game scored to tie. They went on to win the game, all of which i had to go to Youtube to find out what happened. I absolutely have NOT HAD ANY POSITIVE EXPERIENCE from this ""Service""",Yes
"Appalled at the fees involved in watching ""our"" USA olympic team.. Without paying the outdated and incredibly high cable fees, this was not really a good option for seeing the Olympics.† Appalled at the fees involved in watching ""our"" USA olympic team.† Or the number of commercials!!† This was so difficult that our family of 5 just stopped trying to see the Olympics.† In fact, it's likely there will be a whole generation of kids that miss out and therefore don't care about the Olympics, simply due to the greed involved in broadcasting them.Why do you need 20 different media channels for every event. Make it cheaper for your self, and make it available to the American public..... instead of trying to maximize every last penny you can out of every last show you put on.† Is there no corporate good for the public interest anymore. NBC and the Olympics have lost their way here.",Yes
"Should probably be 5 stars. A few issues with buffering, but that was probably my connection. That being said I never lost any of the action.",Yes
"Very efficient at cleaning a Kindle Fire tablet. Because the Kindle isn't your ordinary Google based tablet, and is owned by Amazon, you just can't have a regular cleaner for it and it's idiosyncratic behavior. This app costs $5.00 , but is well worth it to clean all the books, crannies, and pain in the ass worthless crap on a Kindle. Well worth the $5.",Yes
Dangerous. Do not use.. Would give zero if possible. Didnít work and a day later received fishing/spam emails threatening they had images/videos of me. Course never opened the emails as I knew it was a scam to scare you into opening the links. Found it highly suspicious Iíve never had an issue with spam emails but after trying to sign into an app with my email address and password while mirroring with this app the spam email correctly quoted the password I was using. Had to reset all passwords and remove app. Highly dangerous app and in hindsight quite silly of me to have used it in the first place.,Yes
creepy. I got this app and† a ghost was in the living room and then my dog started barking then I looked down and the red dot disappeared and my dog stopped barking it freaked me out. GET THIS GAME if you have a dog then if you hear it barking then look down if you see a dot you know it's a ghost,Yes
"really creepy. See when I was using the app it was saying stuff like &#34;ready,Sunday,track,and other words. But it kept saying &#34;kill,demon,Satan,and other demonic things. But always says Maria. I live in a apartment so it FREAKED me out. That's all keeps saying I don't know it keeps freaking me out but I don't think it's fake I can't tell anyway but it's extremely scary and funny.",Yes
"I'm† a doubting person when it comes to the super natural.† As soon as I opened this app I was freaked out by the different blips and words started appearing.† Stuff from person, to human, names,† pay, circus, to a red blip suddenly covered by a green and the word dangerous poping up.",Yes
Did not like it. Because it have a lot of ads.,Yes
"Didn't like having to buy stuff, to play the game!",Yes
Didn't like this game! It seemed difficult to understand how to play,Yes
"It seems strange, not what I expected",Yes
"But it takes too long to ""find"" items. You have to play the same levels over and over and over again, using up all your energy and sometimes never making any progress towards collections. I really like the game but having played for (far too many) days it's disappointing to make such small steps towards items. A collection can have a requirement of 30 things, some of which it seems you can never ""find"" but rather have to ""buy"".",Yes
Showed promise as being a potentially enjoyable game but...played a few rounds then the game persistently stuck at one point in a game. Couln't get past it. Deleted it.,Yes
"You can only play for 5 minutes before it asks you to pay if you want to play more... not worth the free version. Buy it? No, not worth that either. It's annoying with it's tutorials throughout. And you can't turn off the noise either.",Yes
"My sister-in-law has this for her IPad, so I was delighted to find the Kindle version. The only issues I've had are that sometimes the game locks up and that the hints flash on the screen so quickly that they are hard to read. Probably not a problem for more experienced gamers!",Yes
"I like it lots but lately keeps kicking me off, I load it, push  to play, kicks me off. Over and over. I think I'll give up.",Yes
1. The game has frozen and made itself impossible to keep all the progress.2.  Wish that there many more ways to use or gain gems to play3. Wish that there were more assistance for finishing levels.4.  Customer service is efficient however there should be a way to get personal help after more than three or four email exchanges still does not solve the issue.,Yes
I think I might like this game but it crashes so many times I get frustrated. Too bad...seems like it would be fun.,Yes
I just want to know how you retrieve the gifts friends send to you?  You ask us to send gifts but then you can retrieve them from the game.  Why do we bother????????,Yes
Freezes up!!! Won't load!!! Third time!!! Don't waste your time!!!,Yes
I don't like it.,Yes
"Too much to read, and not interesting.",Yes
Didn't like it at all!  Annoying and boring.,Yes
It is not easy to climb through the levels. I refuse to make purchases in order to advance.  I finally became too frustrated to continue.  I uninstalled the game.,Yes
I hate it it kept popping up on my screen and can't go anywhere,Yes
Did not like.  Erased.,Yes
Can become boring..,Yes
I don't like free games where you can't play continually without having to buy coins or whatever.,Yes
I'm having problems when I try to click on buttons to play the game. It's frustration ng to have to keep pressing on a but to access a playing area or to get instru tions on what to do next,Yes
I would have like to played it a little longer but I started having problem in the middle of moves. The game would slow up and then knock me completely out of the system. Got to frustrated,Yes
Didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like at all. Confusing and disappointing,Yes
Game deleted,Yes
"I think this is one of the worst versions of this game genre I have ever played. Slow ,  unimaginative, repetitive crappy game, story, graphics. Unless you are willing to play this game until your retirement, run ,don't walk away from this game. Not worth it.Did I mention boring ? Consider yourself warned.",Yes
Too much wording. Every time you complete a quest the pyramid appears with the same words. I would prefer to play,Yes
"This game tries to be a little bit of everything (match 3, planting, exploring, battling) and only succeeds in doing nothing well. And it has the worst of all qualities--it is boring. I am removing it from my device and from my cloud.",Yes
Fun game but glitchy. Frequently won't respond to touch.Addicting though frustrating.,Yes

"Disappointing,  game was not as it appeared  advertised",Yes
"confusing and I hate that time runs out , and you have to wait to play again.",Yes

Couldn't get it to work on my tablet. Had to erase it!!,Yes
This game did not spark my imagination. I played it a few times and returned to games that I like better.,Yes
If you like to play games where you don't win then this is for you. I don't play anymore,Yes

unable to correctly review because I have not been able to play,Yes
"First, the game was difficult to control, second, the text was offensively written",Yes
"I downloaded this game not realizing that it is a city-building type game. It is not that type of games I enjoy, but others do so gave it an average rating. Upon completing the download, it was deleted.",Yes
Deleted.,Yes
The fact that any resources that get made after the level is completed don't get added to your resources.,Yes
"I hate this game and want to delete it from my device.  The game at first seemed innocent enough, then all of a sudden I didn't understand what I was doing and I got into shopping;  that's when the program changed and I realized it was like a casino game where I was getting real money.  I got out of that quick!  Even the music on this game sounds evil!  I don't like it at all!!! √∞≈∏ÀúÀÜ",Yes
"Decent game but very transparent in effort to get you to spend real $. Constant ""sales"" and ""offers"", limited game play unless  you buy ""energy"" Too bad",Yes
It's fun but a bit confusing.  Half the time I am not sure I even know what I am doing. It keeps telling me to play levels that I have already played and gotten three stars on.,Yes
"Match 3 is challenging and entertaining. However, it takes an extremely LONG TIME  for credits to build up so play can continue. It also takes a ridiculous amount of plays to obtain needed objects in order to progress up the levels. It seems obvious that the ENTIRE intention is to get players to spend more and more ""real"" money. I have hundreds of thousands of ""play"" money and resources, that seems to be of no value what so ever.  Extremely frustrating! Don't waste your $!",Yes
Too much nonsense going on that interferes with the actual game.  Waste of time.,Yes
Freezes frequently on my Fire HD 6.,Yes
"This is a fun game, but there are way too many challenges introduced, each which take way too many components to complete. If they cut these down to a third, it would be more challenging. They way it is now, there isn't much that makes you want to complete a challenge, because there are 20 more going on at the same time.",Yes
I don't really like that at all,Yes
"This game starts well, even though the graphics and sound are mediocre. You move along nicely.  For a few levels, the you hit a wall. The number of points needed to level up is high, and in order to complete goals and collections, you are rerouted eternally. I'm taking it off, and giving it a low rating out of sheer annoyance. &#34;Free&#34; is definitely the right price for this one.",Yes
not worth my time,Yes
Didn't like it,Yes
Very slow and kinda boring....,Yes
"I really enjoy the game, but I don't understand why when I complete the screen with a high score, I'm not getting the items.",Yes

Boring‚Ä¶,Yes
Didnt like it always asking to buy coins not my interest,Yes
Not enough energy to play very long.,Yes
"To hard to play, and understand.",Yes
"Has a tendency to crash at the worst possible time. Also, the grass is a PITA and I avoid the levels with it in it.",Yes
"The game is fun as far as matching  3's, however the game itself is EXTREMELY confusing as far as what you're playing for and what to do with the things you. I just keep playing levels, but I don't know what it's for.",Yes
You have t0 pay to get out of level one.,Yes
"Here are some bad things about this game:1.  The amount of energy to play the puzzles is too high.  I can go thru 100 energy in less than 30 min. easily.  Then wait for hours for it to build up again only to play 3 or 4 puzzles before it runs out again. COME ON MAN!2.  Why is it SOOOO SOOOO hard for the appropriate items or chargers needed for quests to drop?  Example, During the Chocolate Day Event, after spending over 500 energy (over  2 days worth of playing) I only had 1 recipe finished.  COME ON MAN!3. Having played the game for almost a month and getting over 525 collection items and over 200 chargers (yes I counted them all), I only have 19 collections finished.  That's not even 20.  I've wasted a whole lot of TIME and ENERGY only receive items and some chargers that I DO NOT need.  COME ON MAN!I don't know if y'all designed the game this way, but it needs to change.Here are some suggestions:1.  Reduce the energy cost on the puzzles or increase energy regeneration so that players can play for a little bit longer.2. Please make it easier for quest items and chargers to drop.  Those Magic and Lucky Charm spells (at least for me) didn't help me at all.3. The events have to last a little bit longer.  There needs to be a better chance of getting the reward.4. Increase the time on some of these timed puzzles.  Some of these puzzles are very difficult, having to do them in under a minute and a half is just insane.I like this style of match-3, clear the tiles type of play.  It's a challenging game, that is why I give it this rating.",Yes
"Have to play the same puzzles over and over again in search of items you never get to make collections.  Can quickly become a money pit of you allow it, so beware.  It becomes boring to listen to the same old music and do the same level and never complete collections and tasks.  Done with it.",Yes
Went to open game tonight and found I was back to the beginning.  I had been up to level 28 and almost done with that level.  Will not be playing anymore as I am not starting over.  If this was an upgrade it failed!!!,Yes

"Have the game now a couple of weeks..have to play the same levels over and over and over again to get items...I like a challenge, but this is bordering on rediculous!! Losing interest real fast!! Playing a lot and getting nowhere!",Yes
"Confusing, directions were not clear as to how to gain points, i really never knew what to do, just following prompts.",Yes
This game was fun until the last update. Now the only way to clear some levels is to spend money for items to remove blockers! Not Happy:,Yes
"I finished the first round and when I got to the second round, it would not proceed.There were no instructions to show me how to fix this problem.",Yes
"Too complex for me, not interesting enough",Yes

too slow-too much talking,Yes
"I was very disappointed in this game. All the exciting challenges you see on the advertisings must be far into the game, because at the beginning levels there's nothing different from other ""Match 3"" games. You also can't play very long without needing to spend real money for more lives, or whatever they call it in this game. I deleted the game and won't get sucked in again.",Yes
didn't function well,Yes
Fun but collecting items take a long time... almost to the point of frustration,Yes

Did not order. They tried to charge me for bit coins. Thank heavens my bank caught it.,Yes
this game is not for me!!,Yes
"I got pulled in by the graphics. But if you don't like to play the same screen indefinitely, then stay away from this game. The meta-game is disfunctional. I hit the pay wall on all the fixers needed to complete collections. Without collections I can't defeat the curse block, which locks out my advancement of the game. Furthermore, after many hours of play I only have 4 locations to play 3 have maxed out until experience level is achieved. In one case I will have to play through three more exp levels before moving up to new screens, which means many more hours on the same screens. The ramping calcs are bad.

"Not alot of fun, kind of boring",Yes
want to remove from my list.,Yes
"Too often, I waste time trying to make my next move.  This is especially ridiculous on timed games.  First, I have to wait to move, and that includes even when I attempt your selection.  Then, when I can finally select a square, the game moves it where it wants, not allowing me to make a move.  You can make suggestions, but they shouldn't keep me from moving and you should NEVER, EVER override my  choices!  This has stopped me from progressing as I see no way to handle timed mode as you  control the board.  I am playing the Kindle version.  Other version s may be more honest.",Yes

"Game instructions are flawed and not easy to understand, to exit the game I have to close down my tablet unable to find the exit  game button. Please add clearer game instructions",Yes
"The game is fun to play and you do have to buy things as in other games, but in the special events within the games like earning crystals in the piggy bank once the bank is full to still have to pay $12 to open the bank which should open automatically because you earned the crystals. Fraud!",Yes

"I love Awem developers and the Cradle games, but this one I wasn't fond of at all.  I wish it was  PC computer compatible instead of having to play it on my Kindle Fire.  I was not able to find a way out of the game without turning everything off.  There was no ""exit"" anywhere that I could see.  Also, when you close the game,  your progress is not saved.",Yes

While the game can be interesting at times the most frustrating thing is how slow the progress in leveling up. Although I enjoy most puzzles I have a love hate relationship with night mode.

It is fun but I hate the waiting to recharge.,Yes
It takes too long to complete task on levels and you have to play the SAME game over again to get the target,Yes

couldn't get it to play,Yes
Doesn't work on Android tablet,Yes

Not my kind of a game,Yes
The game was fun until I wanted to use the 65+ gems that I had accumulated (in the piggy bank) and found out I'd have to PAY to use them. So I dumped the game. People should not have to pay to use what they earn for passing levels in game play. Not unless they want to buy extras or other items.,Yes
Agree don't like playing the same level 3-4 times before actually collecting item.This is very frustrating,Yes

"This is the only game that I can't quit playing, although I KNOW I'm not gonna win.  I only get to play about 4 times , then I run out of "" energy "" , then you have to pay real money for more energy, or wait a few hours until it renews by itsself.  There are no instructions, except match up the items.  What do I buy with the coins I win?  Everything requires the diamonds.  I really like the game, I just wish I knew how to play it, AND WIN, SOMETIME.",Yes
"3 stars for creatvity .  But I am constantly frustrated because when I'm  trying to finish a collection and tap on a charger to do it, I often get sent to a game level where the icon flashes. If  I successfully complete it, I rarely win the icon I want.  Instead, Empire gives me a prize I already have. Sometimes. 10 or 15 of them.  Often just close game in frustration.",Yes
To many pop ups,Yes
Too complicated for me. Do this get that go here ... stick with mahjong,Yes

It kept kicking me off so I  uinstalled it,Yes
No thrilled by an means. Same as any other game nothing different or exciting.,Yes
"So disappointed. I was so far into the earlier version. Just lately I'd get app errors, and messages telling me to re-install the game. I finally gave in because I was so tired of my game being interrupted by these messages. We'll guess what! My original game is lost! I have to start all over! NOT HAPPY!!  Oh, and the other guys a re right, there are too many in app purchases and it takes way too long to get to the next levels, acquire coins, and find items!!!!! Such a scrappy deal!",Yes
Wasn't what I thought it was. Didn't match the description that was shown.,Yes
It is not as advertised,Yes
The game was  full of glitches from the beginning. Couldn't play it.,Yes
Required items are hard to collect. Game designed to make you spend money to obtain supplies. Lives are lost upon completion of level whether or not you complete it successfully.  You should be able keep life if you beat the level.,Yes

Second time for this game.Had to reset my Kindle. Like the game  Some levels I have had to buy stuff to beat them. But can't always play for free,Yes
I would have liked this game if it would actually respond to my touch. I have to tap the screen dozens of times for a response. Removing from my cloud now.,Yes

Very confusing. Don't like it.,Yes
Didn't like the game...boring.,Yes
We don't really care for this kind of game. It a bit time consuming and boring although it may help stimulate decision making but who needs to think when we just want to be entertained.,Yes
"Thought it was just going to be like a jewel blitz type game.. I was bored with all the other side stuff, like build a village, go back to the shop, buy a hoe for the garden, etc.  No sooner had I downloaded (thinking it was something else) I un-installed it.  Just not for me.",Yes
Fun but frustratingThe delay between ordering crystals and delivery really slows thing down...but worth the aggravation.,Yes
Download is free but nothing else is. You can't play the game without paying.,Yes
"I've playing this game for over a month. I've purchased many gems, time and other items. The gems didn't come right away many times causing me to lose a level plus the energy to play that level. I contacted the developer with little success. I enjoy the game! But I'm deleting it did to these issues. It's not fun losing the money and it's been a lot of money!",Yes

The game is fun but very confusing . You do not have any info how to get more jewels or anything.,Yes
This game is not at all what they show.,Yes
"I've played about 10 to 12 ""games"" and still confused about what to do to go to the next level.This kinda has a witchy magic feel with an evil element that I don't care for from the ""bad guy"" that we are attempting to defeat.  I'll likely not keep it.  I do not allow any witch craft in my home.",Yes
There seems to be no logic to how this game operates. Play endlessly to collect a charge and you are rewarded with everything but what you seek. Waste of time.,Yes
Game id fun for a little while. After  that it becomes repetitive and boring.,Yes
"I have also been playing for over a year and I get so mad that you have to go through a level a million times before getting the items to complete collections. Somehow I still love the game. I think I persist because I just won't let it beat me and I really curious to see what's coming up next. Please, please fix this issue before it becomes a lost cause.",Yes

This game is boring.  Also on level one I have 24 out of 24 and yet I can't get to level  two.Poor programming.,Yes
Your only given so many lightening lives and it makes the game short lived.  Not enough rewards.  DefinitelyNo way to make jewels short of buying them.  Disappointing game,Yes
not my kind of game at all,Yes
"Very boring game - the levels are mostly the same thing over and over.  It takes forever to get enough points to go up a level.  And you have a seemingly endless list of goals and even when you reach a goal nothing special - you just get more goals.  FYI - these ""free"" games either cost you a fortune with in app purchases so you can play faster or if you choose to play without boosts take forever.",Yes
It kept kicking me out don't download it,Yes
Progress is slower and s!ower as you level up,Yes
"I couldn't uninstall fast enough.  The artwork - though decent - makes the actual game-play tiny and challenging to see.  Also, you can't skip dialogue/story, which pops up before every ""challenge"".  Nor can you skip demonstrations for EASY/OBVIOUS levels.  Not at all what I expected or hoped for, based on the preview.  Too bad, because I thought it had potential for a ""brain exercise break"" game, but it was a huge disappointment and waste of a download -- even though it's free.",Yes
uninstalled,Yes
"This game is fun, but since I refuse to spend money it is slow going.",Yes
Application will not open after update was installed.,Yes
I have already uninstalled. Do not like games that mimic the occult. Example: spells,Yes

Not fun,Yes
Doesn't always tell you how to use things and how to win the challenge.,Yes
"Showed a gear icon that appeared to be settings that would allow turning off or at least lowering the volume on the nauseating music, but seemed to be locked into a tutorial mode because nothing happened when the icon was clicked. After several minutes of frustration trying to get it to work, I uninstalled.",Yes
I didn't really care for it. It was too repetitive and complicated at the same time.,Yes
The ad that I responded to showed different game play...I wish what was advertised matched what I got‚Ä¶,Yes
"he story and different tasks are interesting, but it can be very frustrating. Clearing all the tiles in a level is a nice challenge, but trying to figure out why you can clear all the tiles, but still not pass a level is maddening.Retaking the level, may or may not make it clear what else can be done to improve your score.I wish it were possible to purchase the game outright, as opposed to ""buying crystals"" to complete challenges.",Yes
"Your algorithms suck.  1 move left and you make me ""buy"" more moves. I'm close to deleting this one.",Yes
"The game was really fun in the beginning, but now I have played levels over fifty times and never got the one piece I needed. I too am ready to delete the game because it isn't fun any more.√∞≈∏Àú¬¢",Yes
"SO SLOW...I tried deleting & reinstalling. Graphics & story line enticed me, but it is too slow to respond.",Yes
"I like the game but don't like being ""punished"" for not dragging it out! Every time I try to go on u mess me up by ruining my plays!!",Yes
to much back and forth story line really would like to just play the game without all the story,Yes
Enjoy this game but now will not load after latest update. Disappointed,Yes
The game is too slow moving. I like to work toward goals but this is too frustrating.  You can only play about 6 times (win or lose) before lives are gone.  I can't seem to play for long before I have to leave it and wait to play again.,Yes
Too often the game will not allow you to win.,Yes
"I really like this match 3 game, but I find it frustrating in that you just get to playing and you run out of energy to proceed forward unless you either wait until time fills up the energy meter or you give up and buy, with your money, more resources with which to continue the game! The puzzles are fun and evolve in complexity and new challenges as the game progresses. It is a well constructed game.",Yes
"No matter how many times I uninstall from the device and the cloud , it comes back on my device.  At least a dozen times.",Yes
"There are too many things that you have to unlock. I did give it 3 stars, because many of the things can be unlocked by watching a short advertisement. It gets annoying after awhile though, especially if you have younger children that don't understand how to unlock and keep pushing the video ads to go to the page.",Yes
It didn't work it wasn't taking the photo!!!!,Yes
very slow and not calibrated well.,Yes

I'd give it a 5 star but since an update it's not letting me continue any story.,Yes

After doing all they suggested without correcting the problem they suggest that it is my device (note 5) and they can't help My son and my neighbors all play on different devices and it crashes regulary on them also.

Items obsolete in days and way too expensive.  Game glitches constantly and I get booted all the time.  Game monitors state chat and deletes my messages.  No customer service. Complete waste of my hard earned money.,Yes
Sucks don't get because it's laggy and ads and all that so DONT GET IT PPL,Yes
"this review. Having read multiple reviews from other players I know that my experience is not unique but very common. Each state is governed by the players that cheat the most and spend the most money. The only way to succeed is to spend more money than the other players, or hack the game for items that would cost money. The culminating purpose of the game is to have each state work together to beat out other states in point challenges. However the petty power bullies refuse to allow any smaller players the opportunity to fully engage in the challenges by utterly destroying their base. Wish I never downloaded it. Glad I never spent money on it. Oh, yeah! The big power players try to muscle and intimidate other players into spending money to pay them for protection, like the Mafia. And customer service actually ENDORSES THIS BEHAVIOR!",Yes
Game just sucks,Yes
Probably the most bring and slow game I've ever experienced.  Absolutely nothing to do except follow the script.  Not even any animation to watch the battles and raids that you wait so patently for...just a math calculation and a result.  Yawn.,Yes
Sucked,Yes
They tell you it's free but want you to pay to play,Yes
"Do not have this App any more, I delete it, because it kept frozen every time I start playing it.",Yes
"Pretty lame.  Crashes, no challenges.  Just one non-adventure after another.",Yes
"I just reinstalled this game to write this review and I will remove it when I finish.I got Mobil Strike as a easy enjoyable game which I appraoaced as a non cash player. So, I made lvl 14 and was going to keep playing but the game has become really unstable. It crashes after one or two actions. Can't find the app store or just goes away. Not relaxing, not for me any more....gone.",Yes
"Let's start with the beginning, so one goes to open the app (simple enough) and this part works you can get into the have you downloaded! YAYYY! but not  without twenty pop up adds saying ""commander a special sale is being held just for you"" or some other bogus line like that. And everything makes you pay actual money, in short  use your hard earned money somewhere else",Yes
This is just a money grab. Also horrible performance and constant issues.,Yes
It always needs an update and crashes every minute,Yes
I love the game but it will not update!  I have had a pending update for weeks now and it will not load!  Fix this please!!,Yes

Boring. Slow crash. Don't waste your  time. Removed it immediately after.,Yes
You can be kicked out of the game for both in if somebody who has more power says so and theres nothing you can do,Yes
Horrible gameplay have it on my kindle fire and it keeps crashing won't really let me do anything this is a MAJOR PROBLEM and MUST BE FIXED In my opinion.,Yes
I usually don't give a 1 star rating but this game deserves it. It's next to impossible to play due to its incredible lag. Load times are horrible. Takes from between 3 and 25 seconds to load dialogue after you tap a command. I figured that I would play through the tutorial as it might have been a pregame only problem. It wasn't. Bad lag and load times carry over into the main game as well. Hopefully the developers will patch or update a fix. Until then I am not bothering with it.,Yes
I love this game but it is nearly unplayable as it crashed every max 5 minutes. I am using a 5th generation Kindle Fire. Any help would be appreciated.,Yes
This game is super laggy and you can't do anything when it is that laggy. Btw. I don't think it is like the ads,Yes
Giant money grab.  All tapping and waiting.  Boring and you can't compete with fools that spend over  $100 just to be powerful. Spend  $25 and a month of tapping screen just to get to the point you can't further unless you spend at least  $50 more.  I was a fool to get suckered  in.,Yes
Boring. No real strategy nor do you feel part of a battle. You just wait and wait and wait then spend money to wait less but you still wait,Yes
"Greedy developers, not a free game, daily updates and constant glitches. Avoid completely. I played until earlier this year from the launch; all wasted time and money.",Yes
Doesn't worth it,Yes
Game freezes,Yes
"It's a fun game, but it crashes all the time. It's hard to play it without crashing at least once or twice - usually more!",Yes
I hate this game keeps kicking me off!!!!!!!!!,Yes
Spent over a month trying to like this game. No luck.....huge boring waste of time.,Yes

Does not work in the fire,Yes
Can't progress rules are set so you can be attacked and not defend yourself or retaliate useless garbage.,Yes
rip off. it keeps asking for money and slams me with notices asking for more money before i can do anything in the game. scam for sure. i deleted the app. i don't need this s*** :(,Yes
This game is fun to play but the kindle version has way too many glitches. I just recently downloaded the update and now I can't even get it to load past 60% before it shuts down. Save yourself the frustration and get it on a platform that works (iPhone or Android).,Yes
worst game ever. when ever i get on it  says  this stupid question how old are you and it is not important. worst worst worst. game ever.,Yes
waste of time all they want is money money money,Yes

Cool game except for that it keeps crashing randomly. Need a patch or update to fix this.,Yes
Just a big fat excuse to take your money.,Yes

It is very slow loading and kicks me out she when  playing,Yes
It is so slow you can't do anything without it lagging,Yes
Very glitchy game that requires alot of time AND money.  Nothing will pizz you off more than spending $400-500 on an electronic game just to have it crash constantly and lose items that you have spent time and money building.  Until they fix the glitches and bugs its not worth it.,Yes
This game has horrible glitches and developers will not fix it. They sell incomplete packages to steal your money.,Yes
Bad and very slow serve and you'd need to spend at least $10K to start really playing . Worst customer service ever and poor connection,Yes
its very glitchy.  It shuts down often and freezes up almost as much.  If you don't have money to throw away this isn't the game for you.  They introduce new troops and gear every week or so.  It takes a lot of money to keep up with the changes.  $100 or more at a time.,Yes
A lot of ads to be pursuaded to buy packs and worse thinis the app stores screenshots is nothinclose to the game or the commercial s on tv.. Its like a weird old 90s game with too many menu's,Yes
Sucks don't download,Yes
Can't even play and glitches a lot,Yes
"Let me start by saying I LOVE this game! But I haven't been able to play in almost a week! The app keeps kicking me out and force closing to the app store with a memo that states that I don't have the app store so the app can't run.....and then it automatically sends me to the app store.....which obviously I have or it couldn't send me to it!!!! MADDENING √∞≈∏Àú¬§ Fix my app, I beg of you! I miss my alliance! And playing the game!!!",Yes

Thought I would try this game out and ignore the reviews about the SO called lag. How wrong I was to do that. So slow after pressing a button for anything to happen that you invariably press it  twice. Then some SO called military lezzer bird tells you what to do next. Not having that. Uninstalled and unimpressed. That's 5 mins of my life I won't get back. Avoid.,Yes

"This app is very glitchy and laggy when mirroring a computer on the same network, the mirror file feature works, but if you pause the video from your remote control you have to restart it from the computer you're using to mirror. I would have been better off spending the 10 dollars for the license key on a cable to just plug my computer into the tv.",Yes
App should be clearly noted that it is not free so that customer will not be surprised once the APP is downloaded just to find that their is a cost to use the feature. Cost should be clear on advertisement before downloading. A little mis-leading to the customer. Beware.,Yes

Apps are meant to be easy to use and customer friendly.And work!This app does not fit either criteria,Yes
Purchased for use with fire stick and never received the activation code. Waste of $9.99 with no way to get a code or money back. Trial version worked fantastic though - too bad I never received an activation code for the full version. Would be 5 star!,Yes

Lack of transparency from start.

The link keeps getting lost especially when on the chrome browser.,Yes
"Even though the support team was helpful in trying to make this App work, it under performed in every category.  I was using it on an Apple iPhone SE 2020.

"The guide said that the football game I wanted to watch was going to be on at 10:00am.  When 10:00am rolled around, it was an infomercial instead.  The only reason I wanted CBS was to watch the football games but it won't let me.  Very dissatisfied",Yes

"Had several issues when trying to screencast a video from my phone to the app on my Fire TV. It would crash within about 10 seconds of the video playing.

"Useless - there are no sports on CBS, and why would I want to pay more to not see them?Just another money grab. I hope you greedy fools fail miserably.",Yes

"Well I have to say it was disappointing because I wanted to watch the Green Bay Game, it was unavailable in my area.",Yes

"Downloaded this app to watch the superbowl and I'm not sure if too many people were trying to use it or what, but the stream froze and attempted to load every 20 seconds or less.  I know it was not our internet connection due to our other streaming apps working just fine.  This app should not advertise Live TV if it cannot keep up with the demand, or at the very least give the viewer 5 minutes of uninterrupted watching time.",Yes
"Logged in with my Direct TV account and it said ""Sorry, your TV provider is not yet supported in your location.""  I contacted them but no response.",Yes

Cbs is the only network that charges to  stream content. We have cable so fox nbc and abc are free and can watch live tv Not sure how CBS us able to charge and anyones willing to pay. This channel is basically ESPN news  with the option to choose your highlights. Kinda dumb.,Yes
"It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not easy to use at all, and causes the firestick to freeze.",Yes
They shouldn't advertise all NFL games if they're not going tio show them all,Yes
"Pretty much useless. Thought I could watch CBS sports network on it, but couldn't. It's just clips of shows and other stuff that's meaningless.",Yes
Worked fine at first then it froze for a long time so I turned it off. Missed end of a boring super bowl.,Yes

The station keeps blinking out and I cant cancel the purchase,Yes
"Used it to watch some of the SuperBowl.  The game buffered here and there, but the halftime show had a lot of buffering.  The picture was actually poor sometimes.

The picture was blurry and sometimes kinetic.,Yes
Lots of commercials and some glitching.,Yes
It was constantly being interrupted and the only time we had a really clear picture was during the last quarter of the game.  Don't know if it had to do with our internet or with the streaming.,Yes
This is a waste of an app for me. They won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t let you connect your tv provider to it so you can stream live TV. I was trying to stream football games and couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t .,Yes
"We were excited to try this to watch PGA tour golf, but were unable to stream after about 5 minutes. Disappointing.",Yes
Only select games come on and the quality is terrible,Yes

Same old same old. Not impressed.,Yes
did not meet value expectation,Yes
"Worthless. Was hoping for ability to livestream games like on other network sports apps (NBC, Fox) but all it has is highlights and talking heads. Waste of time.",Yes

It was a little laggy,Yes
terrible - video is lousy,Yes
Doesn't work with my android.,Yes
"got this to watch some event (either the superbowl or the national championship game).  Other than that, they don't stream any games on it.  they don't even give you option to log into a tv account that has the cbs sports network. useless app.",Yes
Live TV was not working,Yes
I signed up for this app on my Amazon Fire Stick. It doesn't offer anything I want to watch and wasn't worth the trouble to download in my opinion,Yes
"It was a rip off, no streaming and gave my information to dozens of third party vendors who have inundated my email account",Yes
I wanted to live stream golf and could only find replays and clips and the CBS Sports network. Could not watch an event being broadcast on the main CBS network. CBS is way behind every other network in live sports streaming.,Yes
"Waste of time!  Despite several calls earlier this week assuring me it would work, it crashes and halts every 5 to 10 seconds, sometimes for 30 sec or more at a time.  Several times a logo screen comes up saying ""CBS Sports Is Unavailable""If you are an Amazon Prime customer like me you were just robbed of promises which you relied upon, to your detriment.",Yes
Doesn't work at all.,Yes
junk,Yes
"The on demand works well. However, their sports coverage is spotty. It was unavailable for the NFL Saints/ Vikings playoff game. Since we got the app to be able to see the nfl games shown on the network this obviously negated our investment. Trying to call their service line just meant being on hold until we gave up. Very disappointed with the app as a primary way to watch CBS.",Yes
Was so happy when the game was over. Not because my team won but happy I didn't have to keep reloading just to watch. Kept dropping signal during commercials.  Watch the previous game that day from a different station with no problems.,Yes
Not a free app.,Yes
"No matter what teams or sports you follow, you always get notifications for other sports.....

Much Better App !!!",Yes
"Would not stream, so I am cancelling.",Yes

After having the app jump past  the coin flip and a few first possession plays, I cut it off and finished watching the game via OTA HD signal.",Yes
"A disappointment for an app which should fully support a paid service. Crashes the kindle fire, so this is the rating.On an iPad, it will run, which allows you to change your roster and check scores, but does not replicate the experience of the full site.",Yes
"Couldn't watch March madness on it, a bit disappointed, seeing as March Madness was hosted on CBS and is one of the most exciting sports to watch all year.",Yes
"No sports to see here. Move along. Nothing live, can get clips anywhere, why bother with this app? Have to pay CBS for the pleasure of watching on my phone what's free over the air.",Yes
No live content as advertised. Worthless,Yes
I could only get yesterday's comments on games by guys I never heard of. Thought I could get the KU game live. Not useful for me.,Yes
I thought that I was going to get to watch the games.  I only get the scoreboard.  What a letdown!A sad fan,Yes
"The most USELESS app I've downloaded so far. Doesn't play ANY live coverage of games, only clips and interviews. Every time I open the app hoping to watch a game I'm continuously disappointed. CBS needs to get their stuff together because this is garbage compared to other network applications.",Yes

Only downloaded it to watch live streaming of cross fit games.  Never connected and never able to view.,Yes
I downloaded that app because I thought we can watch live games but I guess we can't we that app.,Yes

It was pretty worthless.  I deleted it after reviewing what was available ... nothing.,Yes
Thought I was going to get live tv and instead just got taped videos.  Then while I was watching one it changed to a different one so I didn't get to finish the original.,Yes
Useless,Yes
Junk app.  Pure nonsense.  A real tarnish to the corporate name.,Yes

Wanted to watch Crossfit and no where was it to be found,Yes
Hate this app. It never works.,Yes
Doesn't work for me,Yes

"This is one of the worst apps I could possibly think of.  In it, you can stream a decent number of very short commentary segments on various sports.  By 'very short' I mean 2-3 minutes.  I saw NO actual games.  Ya, because what I want in a sports app is to watch NO sports, but to watch short clips of commentary.",Yes
"No live content, just a bunch of short clips, junk!",Yes
This app does not let you watch any games. Only sports news and game highlights. I uninstalled it.,Yes

never loaded,Yes
No longer works on my Kindle fire hd. Last couple of updates have pushed app downward. Now it always asks for location tracking every time to track you and now only displays blue frame and white background if you don't allow the tracking,Yes
Slow,Yes

Just does not work,Yes
terrible!!!,Yes

You can't watch LIVE sports! Which is the only reason I downloaded the app!,Yes
Worthless,Yes
NO WOMEN'S SPORTS -COLLEGE OR PRO.  Don't know why I was surprised.  CBS seems to think only men watch and are interested in sports and nobody cares about women's sports -they are very wrong!!,Yes
I was under the impression you could actually watch some games with this app. Wrong. Just scores and re p or t s which can be found at many other sites. I wouldn't recommend,Yes
no live tv for sports like NFL Nascar. college football. disappointed,Yes

Absolute rubbish,Yes
Greedy bastards,Yes
No live games.,Yes
It was very buggy and frustrating to use. I could not see the football I wanted.,Yes
It was very buggy and frustrating to use.,Yes
I love brackets. But I can't see them on the app and I can't force the browser to show me the desktop site -- it just keeps saying download the app. So this was pointless.,Yes
"The app sucks! Misleading, when I downloaded, I thought I would be able to watch something that was advertised. I thought I would be able to find it from the landing page, but couldn't find what was shown",Yes
Couldn't watch the CSU Oregon St game as advertised,Yes
Cannot watch live video. It only shows previously recorded shows.,Yes

Rubbish,Yes
"Watched a MN Twins baseball game on Fox Sports North. Used my Amazon Firestick on my 1080p LG TV. At times, pitches, swings, and hard running players were a little blurry, and at one point the picture froze, and there was no audio.. Homing the Stick and restarting the app unfroze the stream, and the motion improved, but there was still an occasional hiccup. I usually have very smooth video streaming form my Firestick.",Yes
"New update to both fox apps have caused the error ""no internet connection"".All other apps work.If I let it sit I can hear live streaming audio playing in the background.A reinstall did not fix the problem.A reset of the fire stick did not fix the problem",Yes
"Attempted to use during 1 hour free trial, and found it virtually impossible to use. Didn't like us trying to fast forward and was unstable when we did. Every time we hit the first block of commercials, the app froze during one of the commercials (not the same one each time). Tried for 20 minutes to get past this roadblock (to see the start of the archived event we were trying to watch), finally just gave up. We were using a FireStick to stream on our TV. Problem wasn't internet connection (we tested the speed).",Yes
"Quite possibly the most frustrating app you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll ever use. You can contact the email in the app (settings - about - feedback) and get a generic response.  If you reply to the generic response after you have followed the instructions to no avail, you will not get a response. The authentication to you cable tv provider must not work for the app so it is basically worthless. It works fine on my iPad so Fox must have some issue with their Fire Stick ap",Yes
"After reading that FOX Sports NOW was compatible with my Kindle Fire HD 10. I couldn't get it to work.  After emailing FOX about the problem, they said it was not compatible. Frustrating but no $$$ lost as it was a free app.",Yes
"I thought I had read all the small print, so last week I started watching the Cal/Stanford Big Game.  In the middle of the second quarter the transmission stopped and a message popped up that I was finished with my free view and would have to pay to see the rest of the game.  NOT HAPPY",Yes
"I went to watch the race on FS1 today. When I go to the Fox Sports app I've been using for months it takes me to a new app that I need to download, but there is no way to download the new app. This is useless, and NASCAR wonders why their viewers have declined. I know I won't be watching any sports on any Fox channel. I'm done with them.",Yes
I got the FOX sports app for my FireTV to watch NFL games.  Well you can't do that without a cable TV account.  If I had cable TV I wouldn't need to download the app for FireTV.  Two thumbs down for this waste of time.,Yes
The app for Fox Sports was freezing a lot and would randomly kick me out of the app. It was easier to watch the games from a computer than it was the Firestick. Disappointing.,Yes
"in general the prime stick works fine,but when i use fox sports go it is always freezing...very frutsrating and only reason i have not changed to solely steaming!!",Yes
"Does not work, for me that is. I find most, if not all, Amazon TV programs are not accessible in my geographical region??So what is the use?",Yes
"Not what i was hoping for, more or less a sports update not a true streaming network for my home team. Probably will delete from smart tv and find something more in line of what i want.",Yes
hate fox noise,Yes
"You can only watch NFL football on this if you already have cable or satellite TV. If you do, then what's the point of this application?",Yes
Useless,Yes
Still need to type in the cable provider so doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t matter. Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t waste time if you only have internet and not cable tv package.,Yes
Was disappointed with the stream quality. Lots of buffering even over a super fast fiber optic internet connection. Bummer!,Yes
i never got to watch any of the sports events i wanted to watch. had stereaming and prime issues that never got reolved.,Yes
"This was supposed to be free and would access the Westminster Kennel Club dog show but every time I tried to see it, it said it wasn't supported through my provider.  Waste of time and big disappointment.",Yes
"I was hoping, against hope, that this app would allow me to watch NFL football games for the city I was born in and not the one I live in that was broadcast last Sunday on Fox.  No such luck!  Oh well!",Yes
Purchased PPV. Main event froze three times. Contacted Fox they directed me to terms of agreement. In short they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t help me and kept my money. No replay. I paid for an event I was not able to watch. No Guarantees in the fine print.,Yes
"I downloaded the app, selected my provider, but every time I went to use it, I got a message that there had been some sort of difficulty and it couldn't start. Visiting the foxsports help website did not prove enlightening in the least.",Yes
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m currently in Mexico and 30 miles from San Diego and nothing works here due to licensing laws. What can I do?!,Yes
Unable to determine what level of programming package is required to get this service if you are using Basic DirectTV Satellite and the streaming app of DirectTV Now. A huge disappoint to find local sporting content.,Yes
I have not been able to use this channel.  I put the code in that was sent to me and could not go any further.  It didn't accept the code that was sent to me.,Yes
"Most all of this I needed a cable subscription, I wouldn't have gotten this if I had cable/",Yes
Can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get it to work.  It keeps wanting me to sign in thru the fire stick to my tv provider which is Amazon.  There is no Amazon listed in the selection on the fox sports  website.  Have never had this issue with any of the other fire stick apps.  Hmmm,Yes
couldn't watch what I wanted to. if I want to watch old ball games I would record them. it said you could stream live but that wasn't true.,Yes
"We don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have cable or satellite tv, which is why we were trying to sign up for Fox Sports so we could watch our favorite football team play on Sunday. We made it until halftime, but it turns out this was a preview and we needed to log into our tv provider in order to watch the remainder of the game. If we had a tv provider we wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need to sign up for Fox Sports.",Yes
"App is free, but you still have to have a cable TV provider. The whole purpose of me getting app is because I don't want cable TV I prefer Streaming TV",Yes
Did not work well at all for streaming superbowl LI for me at all.  Terrible! Would give zero stars if I could,Yes
"I tried the app for catching a USWNT game I missed live.  It was easy to find the game on the app, but the picture froze/jumped through the entire match, and the sound was not in sync with the video.  I haven't had this issue on any other app, so I can't blame it on the connection.",Yes
I don't do football and hoped it might show horse racing.  I simply deleted it from the cloud.,Yes
Worthless unless you have a cable connection. DSL providers are either not listed or refuse service when you attempt to connect. Wasted two hours trying everything suggested to access.,Yes
We cannot Access it. Must it be run from a phone or laptop?,Yes
"Same ""no internet connection issue"" as noted by others.  Please fix this!Is Amazon and Fox completely ignorant and stupid to ignore so many users!This app simply does not work on Firetv 4k and I am assuming all the other fire platforms.  This is crap, fix already!  Amazon are you listening?  Fox are you listening?  About ready to give up on all of it.  So frustrating.",Yes
"Cant stream in the Bahamas - bummer, even though i pay for prime i still get an error about the region agreement",Yes
The app didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even work after i purchased the fight. Called in and was told they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t handle the ppv fight.,Yes
"The streaming quality, the picture quality almost from the offset was not was I was expecting from Fox Sports. I was hoping to see a clear picture, instead I got the quality of an old analog tv. Had to switch immediately to my regular feed to watch the super bowl in HD. I hope there are no hidden automatic subscription attached to this offer.",Yes
I didn't realize that the only way to use the app is to have a cable connection in order to view it.  I went to Amazon fire for the purpose of getting rid of cable.  This would also apply to any other apps such as Starz and HBO and others that you can't view unless you have a cable connection.,Yes
The only way to use it was to have a cable tv subscription.  If I had that why would I need the app?  Illogical.,Yes
Stream one NFL game first week and  wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work next Sunday √∞≈∏¬•¬¥√∞≈∏¬§¬®√∞≈∏Àú≈æ√∞≈∏Àú‚Ä¢√¢Àú¬π√Ø¬∏,Yes
It pretends my team is playing on TV but then I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t actually live stream it,Yes
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have any blue jackets games it was a useless app I will be deleting √∞≈∏‚Ñ¢‚Äû,Yes
Worthless since the latest update on the Fire Stick. What happened to the local Fox Sports channels? Used to be able to watch Cincinnati Reds games. I guess I'll be deleting this app. This needs to be fixed!,Yes
You have to have active subscription to one of the major cable companies other wise doesn‚Äôt work,Yes
The channel stopped several times during the show.  Also kept reboothing.,Yes
Not happy an did not know I purchased anything...please remove an refund,Yes
"Quality was excellent in the iPad but was unable to stream- not able to log in on Amazon Prime. Also, unable to stream with Chromestick!",Yes
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because of my cable provider but I can‚Äôt watch much. I try to put on the champions league games and I‚Äôm unable to see them.,Yes
Most every option available required a subscription...not interested!,Yes
"It's Hockey season, where's the hockey games? Very limited choices.",Yes
Could not figure out how to get it to work on tv. Complicated,Yes
I got this but you need cable to use it so it‚Äôs worthless,Yes
junk,Yes
Why should I have to have a cable tv contract to use it?,Yes
Image is not smooth - always a little jitter - like frames are missing.,Yes
Buffered continuously. Only let me watch for 60 minutes!,Yes
"You have to have tv to use this.  If I have TV, what does the app give me?",Yes
"Was a nice thought and hope to see some sports but, as one who does not have cable TV, I was directed to some other subscription options which I didn't want.  So, it didn't work out for me in particular ...",Yes
I didn't like it at all. It was suppose to show sports which is televised on free channels for example the world series. But as soon as the game started it said I had to subscribe. That doesn't make sense. You want me to pay for free channels...get out of here with that bs !!,Yes
Slow and fuzzy but it‚Äôs not the worse I‚Äôve ever seen.,Yes
"Please fix the fast forward feature.  I even don't care if, like many other streaming apps, you make it where you can't fast forward past commercials.  When you leave the room and the game resets, and you can only fast forward 10 seconds at a time, it is pretty ridiculous. Thx",Yes
I was disappointed to get through the process and then it asks for your cable company. That was the reason we bought the Fire Stick was to cut out the cable bill. So I was never able to use it.,Yes
After adding all these apps to my account it seems as if I'm paying as much as I did with cable.,Yes
"We couldn't get the app to work because we don't have cable or satellite or any TV programming that we pay for - except Amazon Fire!  Before it would download, the app wanted a TV provider and Amazon Fire wasn't even an option.  Very disappointed that they require that information.",Yes
Only works with paid cable not with Amazon Prime.,Yes
On my Kindle Fire it shuts down as soon as it boots up.  It has worked previously.  I cleared data and cache and even deleted it and reinstalled.  Still doesn't work.,Yes
The app constantly says no network connection then you hit retry and it loads in then says the same thing. Obviously I have an active network connect or else I wouldn‚Äôt be able to stream using any of the apps on my fire stick,Yes
"I signed on to watch a World Series game, which was great until connection was lost, screen froze, in midst of 9th inning & I missed the big win!!",Yes
Not great content to watch and a lot of commercials.,Yes
condemn the athletes & broadcasters for their behavior,Yes
"I have 50 Mbs Internet. I can stream Fox Sports Go fine on my computer. However, it freezes constantly on Fire TV. It freezes so much that I can exit a game and go back to the game and be off by 5 minutes of game time.",Yes
Don‚Äôt know why you need a cable provider to use this app.You can get the channel free over the air.If I had a cable provider I‚Äôd just watch the shows that way.,Yes
need subscription to watch anything.,Yes
Nothing plays no matter any game you pick,Yes
I could not watch what I wanted.  THE GAME!,Yes
would not take the code to sign no matter how many times I tried kept saying wrong code even though it was on the screen so I just gave up,Yes
"Although it works, the stream is choppy.  It frequently freezes and then plays at fast speeds to catch up.  Not the best, but necessary to watch certain games.",Yes
"I downloaded this app to be able to watch NASCAR when we're traveling.  Imagine my surprise when it would not work without signing in with our ""cable provider"".  We have fiber from a local company which was not on their list.  Can't use the app.  Deleted it quickly really aggravated",Yes
"Tried to open the app, got a prompt to download an update that does not exsist. Deleted all and reinstalled multiple times as still continue to get prompts to update. Total waste of time and effort!",Yes
"If you are using internet only to ditch a cable tv provider, Fox Sports Go will not let you use this free app.  They give you a useless code to give to the tv provider...too bad!",Yes
I could not access the channel,Yes
Not what I expected. Was hoping to stream games.,Yes
Wanted to watch the Superbowl in HD and it kept freezing up!,Yes
I thought it was free and it wasn't,Yes
"Can only time jump 10 seconds at a time. This makes the app basically useless for watching anything that has a pre show or anything like that. I don't feel like sitting here, moving forward 10 seconds at a time for 2 hours just to get to the start of the program. This is 2018, the app feels like 2010.",Yes
I was only able to access sports events that already happened.,Yes
"To much fake trump news, I'm going to delete it.",Yes
Playback was choppy and not a friendly interface,Yes
It won‚Äôt come in - we have satellite rather than cable and live in a rural area. For us it was not worth the frustration or the money each week!99,Yes
could not access this app,Yes
"Does not have NASCAR, only a few things to choose from, women's basketball, swimming. BLAH",Yes
All I got was audio. I uninstalled .,Yes

This shows my app downloaded but it just shows a blank screen when we try to watch it.  Not very satisfied :(,Yes
"Every time I try to watch a MLB game, the video lags 1 to 2 seconds behind the audio.  I have rebooted the device multiple times with no luck.  The fire stick is just two feet away from my wireless router, so distance is not an issue.",Yes
Not interested it wouldn‚Äôt let me connect so no I don‚Äôt want ot,Yes
There were so many commercials it was impossible to watch. Far more than cable TV,Yes
Worthless app-we wanted game coverage...this app just gives already-played game highlights.,Yes
Garbage app that barely lets you log in to watch. Constantly try to update but it always says its up to date,Yes
Does not work in my location,Yes
"Doesn't work at all for me.  It just says ""loading"" and nothing ever comes up.  Don't waste your time on this.",Yes
"My friend had recently cut the cord with his cable tv provider, and told me that he was unable to get this app to work.  As I too have recently cut the cable tv cord, I am also unable to use this app.  Why do I need this if I still have cable, or Dish?  Pretty much a worthless waste of time, and application.",Yes
Never streams hockey,Yes
Buyer beware.,Yes
Only works for an hour unless you have a provider to register with. Literally useless.,Yes
Was not able to watch sports programs I wanted.,Yes
Doesn't work,Yes

Need to have a service provider for this to work.  I have broadcast only.  No worky for me.,Yes
Poor quality,Yes

Dislike. Could never stream anyhing,Yes
Typical garbage from Fox.,Yes
Kept buffering... and the only app that does this!,Yes
"App buffers way to much. Quite possibly the worst streaming app I use.  Or attempt to use. No other apps on my fire TV have any problems or issues. Between the buffering and airing the same commercials on every commercial break, the app is just horrible.",Yes
Worked for a while now I can't watch anymore,Yes
Download this for college football.  Still could not watch my game.,Yes
Can't use this in our area of Georgia.  No broadcasts for this app.  Had to uninstall it.,Yes

A waste of money,Yes
I thought this was ‚Äúfree‚Äù and didn‚Äôt know a charge would follow later.,Yes
it was confusing as to how to get fox sports news,Yes
Just another Corporation bid for money.  Getting rid of Corporate cable and satellite is not an easy thing to do.  They will eventually take over the internet.,Yes

Terrible app on Firetv. Won't connect 9 out of 10 tries. Disconnects every 10 minutes and doesn't reconnect. Is it 2002 again? Come on Fox,Yes

It lagged really bad!,Yes

"Useless. If you want to watch your sports teams while travelling, don't bother getting this app. They give you games which are based on the location of your WiFi connection. So, for example, if you are an Eagles fan and you're visiting Florida, you won't be able to watch the Eagles. You'll get the regional games that are being broadcast in Florida.",Yes
You have to pay to watch so Why did I download?,Yes

You have to have a cable company you cannot stream with just Wi-Fi.,Yes
Can not watch with out cable,Yes
"SUPERBOWL, LOL.  Tried to use it to watch the superbowl, it was terrible.  When commercials would load, sometimes it just showed a Fox logo instead of a commercial.  Other times it loaded a commercial but it would lag while trying to load the commercial and freeze on the last frame of the commercial for a few seconds.  During the game it stuttered and dropped frames a bunch of times.  Last year I used the CBS app to watch the superbowl and it was flawless.  Sorry Fox, one star for now, you still have some work to do for 5 star rating.",Yes
It says free but it's not. Free download != Free Content. There's not even a little bit content they show in exchange for commercials. What a waste of a download,Yes

Very disappointed,Yes
Waste of time.,Yes
could not get signed in!!,Yes
"I wanted to watch the cardinals play, I wasn‚Äôt able.",Yes

Couldn't get it working,Yes

Cannot get the app to open. NY now the show I  wanted to watch is over. Total waste of time,Yes
When I log in through my provider no shows appear. Pretty useless.,Yes
Totally disappointed,Yes
"So frustrating, and there seems to be no willingness on the part of the network to fix it",Yes

coverage goes in and out,Yes
I did like it and I will prefer to be remove,Yes

"almost no live TV, and highlight doesn't work",Yes

Does not work well on my Fire.,Yes
The stream was very blurry and kept going off,Yes

It doesn't work,Yes

"Worst app ever , why do I have to go find my phone or laptop to sign in every f***ing time I want to check in on the progress of a game ? I have 30 Mbps internet and still get stop and game action on my Fire tv.",Yes
This app works great on my Kindles but sucks on my surface pro 3 . It keeps giving me a media error.,Yes
"I was on YouTubeTv, but wanted the Weather Channel and since Fubo was the same price, it would have been a plus. However, Fubo had too many cons. First, and most importantly, the forward button did not show images as it moved forward so I never knew where I was stopping; the ball on the progression bar was jerky - moved forward, then jerked backward then to the spot I wanted; and you had to push an extra button to get to the progression bar to begin with. Then, too many shows were incomplete - leaving seasons completely out. How can you watch season 3 if you haven't seen season 1 - you lose the whole premise! Then, unlike YouTubeTV where you could jump up to the season number and quickly go to a certain season, you had to pan through every show to get a previous one. I knew in the first day of the free trail that YouTubeTV was better.",Yes
"We do not like this app and will be cancelling. It does fine for live tv but if you try to watch a series it is horrible. When you pay as much as you do for this app and then they force you to watch 7 commercials every 5 minutes it gets old really fast. You cannot pause it during a commercial break either so if you have to leave the room you will feel like a kid again when you have to hightail it back in to watch.  If you pause the episode you are watching it will error out and then 9 times out of 10 you have to restart from the beginning. It will not let you pick up where you left off.  Forget trying to ff or rewind. It doesn't work. Also, if you are watching a series and you pick an episode you have already seen when you try to go back it exits out of the app instead of just the episode so you have to find your way all the back through. There are way better apps for way less money.",Yes
Poor quality and takes so long to load. I watched FOX sports North and it only worked for 5 minutes and lost connection.  Went to NBA TV to watch WNBA and same thing.  We watched the first half of a game and after the half time it never came back on until there was 1:00 minute left in the game.  Im on the trial first day and Im already canceling it.  SlingTV Blue with extra Sports is cheaper and more reliable.  DirectTVNOW just added CBS to its line up starting next month (Sept) and all I need is NBC live.  Hopefully FuBoTV will get better.,Yes
Useless. I bought it because I wanted to watch an important soccer game for World Cup qualifiers. It crashed down and could not see even any channel at all. It kept saying that I didn't have network and yet my other apps like Sling or Amazon were fine. I understand that this happen to many people too. First Bad impressions are difficult to forget.,Yes
"I signed up for this App to be able to watch the San Diego Fleet football teams games . After going through the process of signing up, when I attempted to watch the home opener on  Sunday February 17 , your App informed me that that particular game was unavailable. You selling point had been that I WOULD be able to watch AAF games .Very disappointing. I will not continue to use this App .David Cameron",Yes
I gave it a 1 so I could write the review. I have tried two other streaming services and had minimal issues. This is by far the worst thing I have ever tried. Couldn't watch at all. Over a 2 day period nothing would play.,Yes
"I continually struggled logging into Fubo app from both my Firestick and cell phone.  It kept saying that the username or password was incorrect.  However, I could log into my account with those same credentials.  I droppe",Yes
"I am away from home for several weeks and my home town NFL team played its opening game on Sunday. I googled 'ways to watch' my team play. Up popped FUBOTV. The add said I could watch NFL games away from my local viewing area, which is true except they pick the teams I can watch, and my home team wasn't one of them. Needless to say, I missed watching my game.",Yes
They already charged me and was watching a game and 15 minutes later I was disconnected and couldn't get back in. My internet connection is excellent. The Fubo website kept stating to try again later. I gave up. I want to unsubscribe.,Yes
"Didn't get past the 1st day.  Froze (without exaggeration) every 30 seconds. Such a shame because it was very user friendly, had all the channels we wanted and was affordable but the constant buffering made watching any show impossible.",Yes
"Like a strange little 5 second repeat that makes you feel like there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a glitch in the matrix.  It also will just randomly stop in the middle of a show and say it can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t play the requested video at the moment...try again later.  I have a brand new Samsung, unlimited internet and none of our other streaming services have these odd occurrences.  Also, I wish it had more 4K programming.  After football season√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s over, we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll need to reassess.",Yes
I'm sure it's a fine streaming app. They advertised having a college football game I wanted to see. So I signed up only to find out that they did NOT have that game. Won't give my money to a company that lies in their advertising.,Yes
"We are very disappointed because we thought we could get all of the NY Giants games (we've lost Fox on Direct TV). It sounded like the game on Sunday 9/22 would be streamed, but it wasn't.  We also found it difficult to navigate the app, but that could be our lack of experience.  All in all, we ended up paying for a month's viewing that we won't use and have discontinued the service. In our opinion, it was a case of false or misleading advertising.",Yes
"Get an amazon fire stick, download kodi, pay $10 a month to iptv realm and get 1000% more channels, all HD.  No blackouts on local sports teams.  It's sad that in america these crap companies have to blackout sports forcing us to give our money to oversees providers that don't have to play the games.",Yes
"Signed up to get live NFL games, but was only able to access the same game that I can see locally on my cable. Did not give access to other NFL games on at the same time showing in other regions. Waste of time.",Yes
"This application was a complete disappointment. I downloaded it on my Fire Stick, and signed for the free trial, and after that it wouldn't go into the whatever is next. It keep saying: Server error. I really encourage them to first try if the server is available before making anyone going trough the signing process. Really bad user experience. I had to go online after that to remove my subscription. And I tried two times.",Yes
"I was very disappointed. I tried several times to get questions answered from their customer service before trying it, and the answered some question but not the ones I asked. After signing up, none of my local channels were available. Lots of sports channels, but none that had the Super Bowl or any NFL for that matter. Also no NHL. Overpriced for what you get in my opinion.  I'll still with Sling Orange.",Yes
"I signed up the day before Super Bowl 54. It was live all day, up until the game. Then, it displayed a logo and provided only audio as in a Radio Broadcast.I canceled the next day.So much for providing the best in Sports Broadcasting, when it couldn't even broadcast the BIGGEST GAME OF THE YEAR!!!I watched the Spanish Broadcast, for live coverage.",Yes
"Interface is great. easy to use but im having some buffering issues. i dont have this type of problem with other steaming services like netflix, hulu, etc but i guess maybe the difference is this is live TV? it was terrible while watching the superbowl. my kids are getting frustrated also while watching their shows Nick jr, etc. likely going to cancel.",Yes
"I tried fuboTV for 3 days with their 7 day free trial.  Very disappointed.  It kept freezing up and we had to wait, wait, wait.  Then I unplugged the Amazon Firestick I used for fubo, plugged my cable box back in and the problem went away with my cable service (with no fuboTV service).fuboTV needs a few more years to get its act together.",Yes
I did not want to pay for an additional TV service. I was searching for a way to view NBC which was deled from my current cable provider.  I never downloaded this app for the 7-day free trial.  I cannot locate the option to cancel. It is advertised that you may cancel at any time but how?  I deleted this app but received a receipt for the purchase in the amount of $.00 via email.  I fear my credit card will be automatically charged after 7 days even though I did not download the app. It should not be this difficult to cancel.  DO NOT review this app.  This is a nightmare!!,Yes
"I was unable to set up app via Fire TV, so I went online to set up and tried to log in.  I can not get past the initial page explaining charges.  It simply spins and says signing in.  I was eager to use this to catch international matches, but I guess I will have to go to other sources",Yes
"It didn't work at all.  I couldn't even log-in.  I started to sign up for an account and after I entered my email and the pw I wanted, I could click on go back or sign-in.  I clicked on sign in and then I was at the beginning again.  It has a program glitch.  My hubby really wanted to watch the Daytona 500 and that didn't happen.",Yes
Really bad experience with this service. My 3 first recordings did not work so I missed the games. They restored them 2 days after but obviously I already knew the results. Also very poor streaming quality. I hope they improve with time since the selection of sports event is best in market.,Yes
I wish i could give it 0 stars. The only reason i am sticking with it for now is because the competitor does not have more channel lineups.Every live game across all networks buffers. There is no buffering when i use the Fubo tv login credentials on the channel itself ( nbcsn for example).My internet speeds are more than 200 Mbps so that is not a reason for buffering.,Yes
"We're trying different streaming services. Fubo is by far the worst. It constantly hangs, and the picture is bad. It's also the most expensive. Terrible.",Yes
I would have given zero stars if that was an option. Everything was in Spanish and I couldn't figure out how to switch it to English. I called the customer service number (which is automated) and it said it couldn't find my account. I cancelled it within 30 minutes of starting. Save yourself the headache. Don't waste your time. There are plenty of other options that work.,Yes
What surprise me was the lack of staying connected. It couldn't have been my wifi because the other streaming apps did not lag or would time out like Fubo app did.  Twice I had to completely restart the Fubo app in order to get it going again.  Not happy whatsoever..,Yes
"I have it one star because you can't give any fewer. I signed up for this to watch the Kentucky Derby, after they advertised they were airing it, only to find out they were only airing the preliminary races and not the derby. After the nightmare of the sign up process, I was very unhappy to find out I could not watch the race. Canceled immediately.",Yes
"This app was not user friendly, it was difficult to maneuver from channel to channel",Yes
Was disappointed when It continually stalled when I used it. I Could not find many get programs I wanted to watch. I was hoping to see many college football games since I no longer subscribe to cable or direct TV.,Yes
"Along with many other web offers, I found this one to be very difficult to understand, and even more difficult to access. Plus, the terms, such as ""when will my offer be renewed?"" were very difficult to determine.",Yes
"Never could get the service working. downloaded app, then setting it up it wouldn't take my credit cards.. now I can't delete it. Sick of these BS apps and setups",Yes
"The ad said I could watch the game. Yeah, it records the game and you get to watch it after ""the live event"". Then they want $45 a month? I don't think so Tim. I thought I could watch a live game. This app didn't even make 24 hours.",Yes
"Glitch. Glitch. Glitch. Buffering. Buffering. Buffering. Very poor channel guide. Worth the free 7 day trial ... after that, your wasting your money.",Yes
The stream quality wasn't great. Buggered and stalled from time to time even froze. My biggest problem is the price. $700 a yr for the same collection of channels everyone is offering of which you only watch maybe 10.,Yes
"I signed up for a 7 day free trial the day of the Super Bowl for the halftime show and forgot to cancel until the day it renewed (8 days later), because the messages were going to junk mail. I called the same day I was charged and it was ""renewed"" for $59.99 for the coming month. NO REFUND, NI MERCY - RIDICULOUS AND BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE",Yes
This app is lame. We wanted to watch the World Cup. We click on this app and it requires you to go online and enter a code. I was using our TV thru amazon fire and didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to mess with getting out my laptop. I hate apps / shows that advertise on amazon fire but you really can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t watch them - it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s frustrating,Yes
"It keeps asking me to sign in, does not, will not recognize any email I provide. Will not allow me to set up an acct. Useless app as far as I am concerned. Going to uninstall it.",Yes
If you like spending $20 for absolutely nothing then this is for you!!!!,Yes
"Doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have the local ABC channel, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s to glitchy on the menu. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m currently using YouTube TV and it has local ABC channel but missing A&E but performs better and is $5 a mo. cheaper. Will be switching and dropping Fubu TV",Yes
Never able to stream it. Am not inter stead in it. Too much trouble and Amazon Customer Service could not help or resolve the problem. I do not want to subscribe to it.,Yes
More than 20 commercials in a one hour show. Considering the monthly cost I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see how they can justify that much advertising without the ability to skip commercials.,Yes
Would not purchase again. Very expensive for channels you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really need. They say it works across three devices but I could only get it to work on my cell phone. Wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work on TV or computer. Beware!,Yes
We signed up so we could watch the Rams/Patriots game. All over the internet websites and Fubo showed that it would be available on Fubo. But it was NOT available for viewing...at least in our area. Disappointing.,Yes
Very confusing trying to find on demand shows.  Not very user friendly.  Also football game that claimed to be on was no where to be found.,Yes
Purchased for my husband to watch his favorite teams. Only not find the game anywhere. I deleted the app before the free trial is even up,Yes
"It's UI is just laggy & not very intuitive. The mobile app is a little better, plus 30hrs of DVR storage is lame. YouTube TV gives you unlimited DVR recordings for 8 months or so. Also, no ABC/ESPN/Disney family of channels. And it's too damn expensive for what you get & how polished the Smart TV app is.",Yes
"Signed up to watch a sporting event and give it a try, the sporting event they touted was blocked. Could not get any of the on demand, or previous programming to load. Kept saying try again. The live programming is not very user friendly. Have to keep going out of app, and then back in, most of the time spent searching for something to watch, noticed no ABC programming as well?",Yes
So frustrating to set up - worse than similar products. And ultimately didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have what we wanted to watch (football game),Yes
"I did not like that is lists as free, but it is not free. After download, when selecting a program to watch, a popup directs to website for one week free. So, I immediately uninstalled this app.",Yes
I turned on HG TV and the audio turned on and then came on with a second of delay and the audio continued after I closed the app and opened a different app,Yes
Bad quality. Stream cut out in the middle of the game and was never restored. I used YouTube TV instead.,Yes
Too expensive for what I want - mainly because it doesn't get enough sports even though it advertises that it does.,Yes
"I have tried to watch a movie 3 times now and it keeps lagging, and I know it's not our internet, because our movies don't lag Netflix and work fine.",Yes
Way too expensive for what you get. I will be cancelling before the end of my free trial. Just not worth it.,Yes
Couldn't get to the menu/ guide while watching a program.  Slow switching between channels.  For the price not worth it.,Yes
"You can't access it. They send you a code to connect but it comes up with email/password page that even if you create an account, doesn't let you in to connect. Absolute worst.",Yes
No auto play of next episode...so loading up of next episode is cumbersome.  There are only a couple of episodes readily available for viewing so binge watching is out.  Connection/playback issues.,Yes

The advertisement said I could watch The World Series on this channel but I found out that was not true!,Yes
Purchased to watch an out of region game on NBA TV. The game was blocked out on PS Vue. Great that we were able to get the game but the stream buffered every 30 seconds. Very annoying. My internet is 100mb down on fiber. My device was hard wired. I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t ever have bu,Yes

Decent but not for me,Yes
The selection of channels is great. This app does freeze up and slow down the Firestick though. After watching Fubo we have to force stop apps and restart the Firestick to watch other apps. If this issue is corrected then Fubo would be terrific.,Yes

Not many options,Yes
Not interesting.,Yes

So we created a new account to avoid getting kicked off, and they flagged us and blocked us from signing up for a free trial. I asked if we could proceed without the free trial, as we are willing to continue paying for the service, and I was told we were blocked from signing up ever again. A little disappointed considering we loved Fubo and would love to continue paying for the service.",Yes
"This was the worst live stream tv app/site that I have tried. As soon as we started watching it was very pixelated and jumpy and kept freezing. It did not stream clearly at all. After about 5 times of it stopping, saying that they were having technical difficulties, I cancelled my trial.",Yes

I signed up today at 7:30pm for a free trial to watch one soccer game and I watched 20 minutes and after that I wasn't able to go into the website nor app nothing. It's been an hour and still doesn't work. Make me think it's a scam trying to get cc information,Yes

I am not impressed with this TV app.  I was hoping with all the sports they say they have would show NHL Hockey on Fox Sun Sports and Fox Sports Florida.  They show the out of network shows instead.  I have had Sling TV for the past 3 years and I will be staying with it!,Yes

"What exactly is the point of a streaming app that requires a provider connection? If I already have a provider service, that probably has a DVR device, this app (and the service it provides) is completely useless. NBC Sports, please hop into the present and provide a true streaming app.No one needs cable any more so drop the provider requirement and join the new paradigm.",Yes
"I have been using this app for over a year and about two or three weeks ago it has stopped working on any of my Fire TV devices. The app loads but all I get is a cryptic message ""an error has occurred"". I have tried every suggestion and nothing has worked.",Yes
"Impossible to watch with all the freezing and buffering.I am hardwired via ethernet with a 50 mbps fiber connection (which usually tests closer to 60 mpbs) and the streams from this app are unwatchable making the app worthless.  I can stream the game on my tablet via my cable provider's app flawlessly and I can stream other apps on my fire tv without issue so there's no doubt it's the terrible NBC Sports app that is giving me trouble.  What can you expect for a free channel - what's that? Oh that's right, NBC Sports requires a costly cable subscription even for games streamed live OTA via antenna.  What can you expect for a paid channel?  Apparently nothing.",Yes
Cuts to commercial about every two minutes.  This app is a colossal waste of my time.  We√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had live streaming apps for several years now and this is what NBC lays before us?  Complete garbage.,Yes
"Thank you for the free 30 minutes of viewing the Olympics.  Also, thank you for the 20 minutes of commercials that also counted towards that free 30 minutes so really, 10 minutes of the Olympics.  So, what I should really say is:  Thank you for the free app that I have to have a TV/Cable service to use properly (which is the exact same EXPENSIVE service I got rid of)  So, this is a pretty useless app for those of us that Cut the Cord.",Yes
"Absolutely a waste of time.  No search feature available to find events, backing to arrow through  is ridiculous. Beyond that, all you have is NBCs ""highlights""  edit and worthless commentary; with more commercial length than actual event coverage.  I long for the days when ABC was the leader in sports coverage. Live events, factual and to the point auditories, and no political or broadcast politics. It has 1 star because I cannot rate it lower. In diving it would rate a failed dive.",Yes
So disapponted that this is being forced to watch coverage of the Winter Olympics.  We cut the cable but cannot get NBC over the air in our location.  So planning to watch this was squashed when you must have a paid TV service.  What happened to network television that has always been free.  Shame NBC.,Yes
"Pixelated games of hockey are hard to watch cause you can't see the puck.  Freezes up almost every game towards the end of the game. Super annoying when it's a game in overtime. Then I restart it to try and get it going and end up having to watch commercials and then I miss the end. It has happened so many times crazy.On the ""Live"" page,  the start time of games disappears and a ""play"" emoji appears, way before the game starts.They also have been playing the same ONE commercial for over a year.  Yeah, I've been a customer for like 2 years and the same commercial has been the only commercial they use.",Yes
"Unfortunately all of the sports that NBC has purchased are trapped behind this incredibly frustrating app. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve used it for years now, and I would guess I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been asked to authorize the app more than 50 times. Netflix, Hulu, heck even crackle aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t constantly prompting for logins.Browsing a program is also difficult. Of course I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t expect to fast forward through commercials, but seeking a point in a replay is done by skipping ahead 10 seconds at a time. It does feature a seek function by pausing and fast forwarding, but that doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work.If it worked as designed it would be outstanding, but as seems to be the theme with the traditional networks, it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m excited for the day Netflix picks up the Premier League and Amazon the NFL.",Yes
"It never worked. Signing up for some of these apps is very misleading. Prior to downloading,  the app does not tell you before you download it that you must have cable or satellite or a membership to Hulu or any of the other server type apps in order for the apps to work.  So it's a waste of time to download then set up the account and then find out at the end of setting up the account that you need one of these other services in order for the app to work. Apps need to be more upfront with what's required before you do all the downloads.",Yes
"Constantly glitching. Would give a spinning wheel consistently about every 3-5 minutes and then cut to 3-5 min of commercials (presumably ones provided by the app, not the network, because it was the exact same commercials and it would often cut off what someone was actually saying on the livestream). Just horrible bugs that need to be worked out. Impossible to watch a live game. You're better off getting an antenna and standing at the window holding it for reception.",Yes
What an awful SCAM 29 minutes into viewing the opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics the channel goes black and I spend the next 2 hours trying to figure out how to view the games. Ended up having to buy a $49.99 subscription to Hulu. What a manipulative scam NBC ruined my Friday Night!!!,Yes
"Very disappointed in this app.  I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a Spectrum TV Cable subscriber, but when I entered my credentials I received a message that NBC doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a streaming agreement with Spectrum.  I used credentials from Cox Communications and was able to get the app to work. Then I find out that commercials interrupt the Olympic programming all too often, the app buffers a lot and when you switch to different events you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re forced to watch the same annoying commercial that you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve already seen 20 times only to discover that √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthe coverage is completed √¢‚Ç¨≈ìor a different event entirely. Terrible job NBC!  Makes me long for the days of ABC√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Wide World of Sports and Jim McKay.",Yes
I was able to watch the Super Bowl for free with my amazon prime membership but it was very delayed and was not playing the game in real time. I was still watching the game when my fianc√É¬© called me from work to tell me that the eagles won. It was a bummer that the entire world knew who won and that the game was over and I still had about 5 minutes left to watch.,Yes
"Wanting to watch a sports program on something larger than my computer screen, I downloaded the NBC Sports app to my Fire TV.  When I tried to activate the app, it refused to accept my login information.  After several attempts, I gave up, uninstalled the app and went back to watching on my small computer screen",Yes
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t waste your time even if you are cutting the cord. Easily 30% of content is commercials one cannot skip. Just DVR the programs and delay your watching by 30 minutes: at least you can skip the odious commercials,Yes
"I thought I would be able to get this using my Fire Stick and my HD antenna. Unfortunately it does not. It requires me to have some sort of cable or satellite service that I pay for. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m very unhappy about this! I got the NBC SN when I had satellite, and the point is to eliminate that expense!",Yes
"useless app, activation code comes on the screen on Tv and you enter it into your laptop, then it says you need another code so you type that in, can't get past this using Amazon Fire TV box. After 3 dAY OF trying I deleted it. I installed the app on my table and it works. I have installed 30 something apps on the fire tv box, this is not my first rodeo",Yes
"This app is virtually useless unless you pay for cable or satellite TV service. And if you do then what are you doing trying to watch it on Amazon for? All apps that require paid TV service should be band from the App Store. The reason you bought the Amazon Fire stick in the first place was so that you wouldn't have to pay for TV service. And if you do pay for service you'd be watching that service, not trying to get it on the fire stick.",Yes
I am upset to have to download something to watch golf. I think you'll lose a bunch of followers if you continue with Peacock or any other download.I know I won't go through the frustration again.,Yes
"I very much like that I can stream Sunday night football... but it is SO glitchy!  Often throughout programming, it buffers and repeats what has already been played - which in and of itself is annoying but then when this happens a few times, the lag between what is being watched and real time is considerable. When they figure out how to fix this, I think it‚Äôll be a decent app.",Yes
"It would be nice if they told you had to have a cable TV provider for this to work. What is the point of having a Firestick if you have cable?I was led to believe this app would allow me to watch the Olympics, NOT the case!I live in an area where cable isn't available, after talking with troubleshooting techs I was told I could subscribe to Sling TV and pay their $25 package and watch all events live. Nope, still need a TV provider and a code to make it work.I would rate a zero if that would have been an option. Very misleading!",Yes
"We downloaded for the Super Bowl because we do not pick up NBC through antenna. The entire game was very grainy. It was as if we were watching the game through an old analog TV from 1988. It also had moments where it had to buffer, but that wasn‚Äôt too bad. I just don‚Äôt understand why the picture quality was so poor.",Yes
"What's the point of having an app, if you have to sign in using your cable provider?  The point of having prime is to forego having a cable provider.",Yes
"After reading these reviews I now understand what it means when my tv screen asks for credentials. I am new to the Fire Stick and was just coming to realize what it meant. I don't have cable/dish and feel Amazon also misleads what you can watch. Luckily, I have Prime and Netflix, but then, I  really wouldn't need the stick, would I? I could also just subscribe to HULU or Sling and be happier.",Yes
"I use Amazon fire tv for streaming , while watching super bowl pregame show I got constant buffering. Ended up going to over air waves antenna and watching it on local channel with no issues. Not sure what issue was trying t o stream via Amazon.",Yes
Application would not let me connect even with my correct service provider. Customer service responded but was unable and unwilling to look further,Yes
This app does not work unless you already have it on cable or satellite!  The reason we wanted it was because we were not gong to ever be tied to those expensive companies again.This is a why bother app.  Don't waste your time.,Yes
"Loaded this on my FIRE-TV and went to the NBCSports dot COM/Activate page.  Selected FIRE TV and XFINITY; No matter what I tried, NBC will not take the activation code.  Rebooted the FIRE, requested new code multiple times, nothing.  Highly disappointing.",Yes
I used the supplied codes two time and could not get on to watch the hockey game; just a waste of time and very disappointing. How do I delete this site from my TV?,Yes
"I'm not sure whether it was my internet connection or the NBC Sports feed, but the Super Bowl was buffering so badly that it was 10 to 15 minutes behind over-the-air broadcast before halftime.  I eventually gave up and watched the game on an older TV with an indoor over-the-air antenna.",Yes
"I may cancel my prime membership over the difficulty using this app. It's useless to watch and right before a game starts, it's throws up a requirement to enter my log in information for my provider, which I don't have any longer. Total waste of my time and effort. Amazon has to do a better job of explaining what is included in prime and what is not, and what can be accessed.Not happy at all",Yes
"Liked the ability to choose what events to watch.  Do not like the fast forward option....ObvIously, can not fast forward through the commercials, but you can not tell where you are when fast forwarding through an event.  You have to guess using a little progress bar....awkward.",Yes
"Watched the nascar race yesterday using my amazon fire stick. Not sure if the constant buffering was nbc, or the device, but I saw the race..",Yes
"NBC needs to fix this app. It keeps crashing, and each time the only way to fix it is to completely reset my firestick (even wiping the data from the app and re-installing it doesn't work). Then I have to re-download all the apps onto the firestick. When it's working it's fine; I pay for NBC Sports Gold so I can watch Premier League games, and it's great for that. But it crashes fairly often and then everything has to be wiped and reset.",Yes
I downloaded the NBC Sports App so that I could watch the Sunday Night Football.  The app it self works fine but it won't allow me to watch the live Sunday Night Footbal.  Very disappointing....,Yes
Very disappointed that NBC doesn't have an option to subscribe just with them only. Pretty much you have to be subscribed to a cable company to be able to watch. I cut the cord long time ago and I pay for things I only use (very happy about it) too bad for NBC not having subscription options.  They better think about it.,Yes
It sucks. Constant buffering. Every time you leave and come back to nbc sports Boston you have to suffer through that Nissan commercial weather or not the program is in an actual break. Wish I could give it no stars!,Yes
"though we could enjoy this for watching some olympic events, but even with this app, you need to be getting ripped off by a cable company before it will work.",Yes
This was horribly disappointing. I wanted the app because I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a TV provider. Finding out I needed one To use the app was totally defeating the purpose. I would not recommend this app system to anyone.,Yes
It works a little slow during live games and doesn't seem as integrated and updated as other apps.,Yes
pushing how you can catch all the action from the RIO OLYMPICS??? Then it crashes on everything if you're not on a google product??? Horrendous waste of time.,Yes
"We downloaded this app to watch the Olympics, but all we got to see where bits and pieces of events. This was the worst Olympic coverage ever.",Yes
We√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve not been able to get it to work. The app takes us in circles and is incredibly frustrating.  Surely NBC could do better.,Yes
Totally useless you must have cable TV to get this and why would you get this if you have cable TV would already be included I tried every which way I could to receive content but to no avail don't bother.,Yes
I only got highlights of the cycling race.  I thought I was recording the entire race.  Somewhat disappointed.,Yes
I only got highlights of the cycling race.  I thought I was recording the entire race.  Somewhat disappointed.,Yes
"got this for the olympics but it only works if you have cable, why not state that in the app description?",Yes
I downloaded this app to watch the British open.  It stalled on a black screen and would only show a couple minutes of programming each hour that would actually load.  Very disappointed.,Yes
Hardly ever works and when it does it still sucks,Yes
"They don't mention in the description that it doesn't work unless you are a cable tv subscriber.  Totally useless to me, a Hulu Live TV user.",Yes
"When this app works it provides a sharp picture and fine sound. Unfortunately, the picture buffers frequently. It is very frustrating to watch a spinning yellow arrow instead of a sporting event. I have a 75 MB/sec connection and other streaming apps work fine. If NBC could work out the bugs they would have a winner.",Yes
"Does not work, period. Even though NBC is an over the air network, they require a cable log in. When I used my cable log in, they would not accept it for this app. There is also a free ""30"" minute preview that they shut off after 22 minutes. Useless",Yes
garbage have to have cable tv service to use this. completely stupid.,Yes
Disappointed to find out I would have to have a smart TV or a tv subscription to access the Olympics.  Even after signing up for spectrum tv I still couldn't access it.  Huge disappointment,Yes
"The MLB app doesn't give you the entire showing of the games it states it will play.  We are not happy with this app at all.  Do yourself a favor, and don't purchase this app.",Yes
The previews for this app specifically stated no need to log in with cable provider and 20 mins into the football game it logged out and would not go back with out further requirements. Misleading and very disappointing. I will not use this app again and now am leery of others,Yes
"Can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t use it by streaming, you need a tv provider. Discrimination!!!!!",Yes
Would not display anything. Deleting,Yes
I feel it is false advertising to say an app is free then charge for it.,Yes
Says no games are available in my area,Yes
"I downloaded for nothing. It won't let me see anything unless I give them my cable info. I don't do cable, only fire stick. So I'm deleting ",Yes
More ads than content. Home screen not well organized. Poor reporting. Worse background stories. Stopped using it after about 10 minutes; 7 of which were ads.,Yes
Not user friendly. Never even got on. Not sure why I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m being asked to do a review.,Yes
Did not work for my needs.,Yes
"t's NBC. I don't have cable. I have internet. And yet I still couldn't watch the hockey game because I had to have a TV subscription to do so.  If I HAD TV, why in earth would I be watching it on amazon?!?!?!??  Stupid and useless.",Yes
"spectrum cable, even though I have been a customer for 15 years, still doesn't know who I am. So this is useless to me",Yes
Streaming was inconsistent!,Yes
"You can forget watching Premier League matches with this app. I get the common ""Unable to play this asset"" only on Premier League matches. All other shows play fine. I am using version 3.2 of this app. Version 4 is even worse as it just says ""An error has occured."" Worthless in every way.",Yes
Got it to watch olympics. It showed a few intro clips and rhat was all. The interface is confusing.,Yes
It don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work half the time,Yes
"It sucks with Amazon Fire, The SuperBowl was unwatchable because of all the Buffering...",Yes
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get into it.,Yes
Can't watch without a subscription. Misleading.,Yes
"Every NBC application that I've used, regardless of Operating System or Hardware, has been absolute garbage.  This one is no different, because like the others, it continues to crash or freeze.  Come on, NBC!!!",Yes
Every thing was blocked,Yes
There are too many adds. Why do they have to play an add before showing a screen that says coverage has not started yet? It's a waste of my time.,Yes
way way way way too many commercials...annoying beyond belief... same ones constantly... come on NBC... you are making enough off the olympics... wth?,Yes
App is useless unless you have a cable subscription with NBC. Why do you need the app if you already have it on cable!,Yes
Didn't work. Waste of time.,Yes
The app didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work. I got an error every time I tried to authenticate with my PlayStation Vue credentials.,Yes
Will not work at all with Windstream our internet provider,Yes
"Stupid, I hate how with all these apps I have to go online and register my account all the time and this stupid app is no different. It seems like every time I want to watch any app i have to reregister.",Yes
not user friendly..could not operate,Yes
Unable to even use it. Says there is an error.,Yes
"The app crashes every time I try to stream the game. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve authenticated multiple times and checked my bandwidth (other streaming apps work), nothing works.",Yes
The biggest complaint is stream quality. Seemed kind of herky jerky and not very smooth. Not sure what the problem there is.,Yes
"Watched super bowl.  Noticed it had a 1 minute delay over my antenna.  Also, had service interruptions on my wifi?  Not sure I will ever use the other features?",Yes
I tried the free half hour to see if it would be worth paying for to see the Olympics. The answer is a resounding 'NO'. There were so many commercials during that 30 minutes. I was shocked!,Yes
does not work,Yes
Required membership,Yes
how can I watch the Kentucky Derby ifnbc purchases sole rights to it and even turns off TVG which is where I would watch it anyway;this kind of monopoly over an important sports event is disgusting. No...i do not want cable. never will!,Yes
Did not like at all. Never was able to get the live TV part of the apt to work. It would only let me watch clips and replays. Awful for someone that wants to live stream a sports game.,Yes
There seems to be a lot of lag in Olympic coverage but I love the features!,Yes
It did nothing but buffer.,Yes
I could NOT watch the PGA Tour Live app. It did NOT respond at all. Very disappointing! Why did the PGA tour go with these guys!!!,Yes
Doesn`t work in Ecuador,Yes
Adds every 30 seconds. Annoying.,Yes
I just want to watch the French Open live and I don't have a cable subscription BECAUSE I GOT ALL THESE STUPID APPS TO REPLACE AN OVERLY EXPENSIVE CABLE PACKAGE. What is WRONG with NBC that they don't realize that the market is shifting?! This app is deeply frustrating and completely useless. Don't waste your time on it.,Yes
Didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work for me,Yes
"Too many commercials, will cut right into a Olympic event to show the same commercial  you've seen 100 times. Horrible, NBC should lose their rights to broadcast the Olympics.",Yes
I get an error code for parental controls. But it doesn't let me change parental controls anywhere. Disappointed that I always fight with this app.,Yes
"This has been a terrible and worthless download. We can never get the highlights to work. It's constantly buffering, even for footage a couple of days old. Might as well watch it on TV and record what events you want to see - or if you don't have TV, just be severely patient, and I'm sure it will come up eventually.",Yes
This app does not work at all.  It gives countless activation codes that when you put in just tell you they aren't valid.,Yes
It didn't work for me because I didn't have the channels on my dish channels.  Whay was the use of having Amazon prime when I couldn't use it stand alone.,Yes
I keep getting the error √¢‚Ç¨≈ìunable to play this asset√¢‚Ç¨,Yes
We were never able to sign in,Yes
"Pointless unless you have a cable tv provider. When will these folks learn? Cable is a thing of the past. Stand alone apps, please!",Yes
Cant get live events,Yes
"It freezes up too much, and doesn't double screen during commercials.  Something happens during commercials, you miss it.  It takes them forever to play it back!",Yes
Picture is terrible,Yes
Huge disappointment.  I cannot steam with my provider and I missed out on Sundsy Night Football,Yes
Too hard to get connected.  I gave up.,Yes
The entire point of the Amazon Fire stick for me was too dump cable.  An app that requires me to have a cable service to watch programming is useless.,Yes
So many problems to get started then to have the picture freeze and stop,Yes
"If you don't have cable, this app is useless.  And if you have cable, you don't need apps.",Yes
I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t able to watch anything. It kept buffering. Seems to be a constant problem with Amazon. I hope they can improve their streaming. I switched to Apple TV and it worked just fine so it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not my internet connection.,Yes
Wouldn't show games I wan't,Yes
"Pretty bad.  Watched football on it and it buffered constantly.  CBS streaming infrastructure is not yet ready for prime-time.  I imagine it would work fine for casual viewing, but not for events like football where everyone tunes in a the same time.",Yes
Constantly buffering - this is the only app of all the sports apps that has this issue (I also have Fox Sports Go and WatchESPN).You can watch games but be prepared to reload the game in 5-10 minute intervals because it buffers for no reason.,Yes
Would only let me watch Sunday night football for a short period. Disappointing,Yes
didn't  work,Yes
"For those of us who have cut the cable (or dish) and gotten the Fire TV, this app is worthless. It would have been nice to watch the main NBC channel during the Olympics, but not even that seems to be possible.",Yes
"This app routinely crashes and it seems like when there are more people accessing it during the evenings it has to buffer or crashes.  Come on NBC, you paid tons of money to cover the Olympics ans you can't handle it!",Yes
Completely useless unless you have a cable/satellite subscription.  If I had that why would I download this app?  We don't have cable or satellite TV that is why we use Prime.  It is free so I am not out any money but if I had cable or satellite I could watch NBC sports through my provider.,Yes
"Very disappointed! could not use this app because I do not have a paid TV subscription. I shut off my TV subscription and went to internet only because I was tired of the high prices. I am paying for internet and paying for Amazon Prime, this should qualify me to use this app",Yes
I downloaded the app to watch a live game. I don't have cable. NBC does not come in even locally with my antenna. To use the app you must log into your cable provider. If I had cable... I wouldn't need the dang app!! It is useless on its own.,Yes
All I get is blackouts,Yes
Too many commercials and they pick and choose what you can watch.,Yes
"Didn't get to see full Olympic events. Had to have subscription to cable. Well, I got rid of cable and bought a Fire stick- so now what? Sigh...",Yes
"Worthless. Another ""app"" that requires you to have a cable subscription to use. Haven't PBS and HBO taught that stand alone products are available and desired?",Yes
Could not activate the app on my fire tv. Very disappointed. Tried several times but still no go.,Yes
App is ALWAYS buffering..,Yes
"Don't have cable, so wouldn't work.",Yes
I would say the app works perfect but it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t. My boyfriend and I were watching an intense football game the other night and it just stopped working on us. Eventually it got to the point where it wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t reload either and we couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t finish watching the game or anything else on the app either. Very disappointed.,Yes
Must have a cable provider....  I dont have one so i cant sign on!,Yes
Works well about half the time if that. I dealt with a lot of lag during streams and it was quite annoying to deal with.,Yes
"Lots of options, but the app itself is quite terrible. Quality is poor. Lots of buffering and freezing.I have 60mbsp down so would think bandwidth isn't a problem. If worked well app would be great.",Yes
Such a head ache.  Not user friendly never works .  Uninstalled,Yes
"We downloaded the app with hopes of getting a better Olympic viewing experience! After spending several minutes with the app buffering, rebooting, etc. We switched to another online service. I have attempted to watch other items with zero success",Yes
It's not bad. The program is about 5 minutes delay compare with TV channel,Yes
"Nothing at all,",Yes
don't like,Yes
"Got this (supposedly) so i could watch nbc sports on my firestick. Entered the codes on multiple occasions and still unable to warch this network. Very frustrating process, big hockey fan but went elsewhere to watch their stream.",Yes
So much buffering that it was impossible to watch.,Yes
This app is terrible.  I pay for nbc gold and even since they did away with the nbc gold app it will no longer let me login to nbc gold on my tv or fire stick. I am able to log on on my phone but even then the streaming quality is terrible.,Yes
"The first time I went to use the application in my KODI device, I realized that I had to pay for just about every single sport I had ny interest in. This is *not* what I had hoped for and expected. Very disappointing.",Yes
Don't bother it has nothing to offer,Yes
"You have to access through a cable provider. Wouldn't I just turn on the TV if I had cable? So disappointed, was all ready for the Olympics. Terrible app.",Yes
I will not order this again.,Yes
"This did not work on my TV. I was hoping to use it to watch the Olympics using my cable provider, but it was very limited.",Yes
Useless app,Yes
I used this app to watch the super bowl. It continued to buffer and by half time I was about 10 minutes behind. I eventually turned it off. While watching other  apps that evening they weren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t doing the same so it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t the connection.,Yes
When the amazon app purchase came through I thought it meant I had access through Amazon - didn't know I still needed cable to stream.  What's the point of downloading the app through my fire stick if that's the case?,Yes
Being assigned in Germany and wanting to watch the Tour de France. I found it disappointing that I couldn't track the Tour via NBC Sports.,Yes
Didn't work on my firetv.  Had errors connecting to stream.  Had to uninstall.,Yes
lots of commercials,Yes
Used it to watch the SuperBowl. It kept buffering and delayed the game.  At times when it finally stopped buffering the program stopped playing in HD.  Very disappointed in it.  I finally stopped using the app and watched the program from a local station.,Yes
We cut the cord several months ago.  Husband was going to use this to watch games but it only works if you have a cable provider.  Disappointing.,Yes
Super glitchy.  Couldn't even make it through single drive without glitching out. My internet service is fast and other apps work great.,Yes
"Downloaded this app so I could watch the Superbowl and then ""This is Us"" right afterwards.  It kept coming in and out during the game saying, ""Coverage will return momentarily"", so I missed pieces of the game as well as a few of the funnier commercials.  And then it kept buffering during ""This Is Us"" which was quite frustrating.",Yes
Didn't work for me,Yes
"Watched the 45 minute free preview and it was slow, choppy and frozen most of the time. Needless to say I'm not purchasing this app.",Yes
slow,Yes
I'm sure the broadcast is great - I just couldn't get it to work on FIRE tv.  Frustrating!,Yes
"When it worked, it worked well. However, too many times the channel would stop playing (buffering or a message appeared stating channel to resume soon). Very annoying! If that issue can be fixed, the rating would go to 5 stars.",Yes
"This app is not only glitchy and horrible quality, but after I downloaded it, MY ENTIRE FIRE TV FROZE UP AND IS COMPLETELY UNUSABLE. zero stars, very upset. do not download this piece of garbage. come on NBC get your stuff together!",Yes
Seriously disappointing in terms of content. Only a small few sports events are available and most just are highlights. Considering that the only way you can get this is if you have one of the cooperating or associate cable companies.,Yes
I tried getting the NBC Sports app along with the NBC premier league gold package this past weekend and NBC had extreme technical difficulties and nothing was working as well as the fact that they weren't responsive in trying to contact them over the issue.  Extremely disappointed with their product.,Yes
Disconnected Olympics many times said I wasent a valid customer.,Yes
Did not work for me at all but it works on the phone,Yes
I downloaded this APP with ease but I can't seem to be able to use it because it requires a TV provider. Apparently Amazon Fire Stick is not a TV provider.,Yes
Couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t make it work,Yes
Such a big Rip Off!  Fire TV promised Olympic coverage on NBC but what a giant rip off!  Promises and no delivery!  I had to buy an antennae and watch my local channel. How about 0 stars!,Yes
I had 10 free minutes to decide if I wanted to subscribe. All ten minutes we're ads. No thanks. Awful!,Yes
Bad stream quality with many freezes.  No other app on my Firestick has this problem.,Yes
Worthless.,Yes
I picked up nbc sports to watch the Indy 500 only to find out I had to have a service provider. I wish I knew this before I subscribed to nbc. Now I have to figure out how to unsubscribe to nbc.,Yes
Worthless since you have to have a cable TV account to activate it.,Yes
"nothing interesting here.  Also, you need a cable subscription code to activate it",Yes
"Unfortunately, it was not available with the Dish package i subscribe to. I am new to this ""streaming"" TV stuff, very frustrating",Yes
Got to watch half an hour before it cut me off.,Yes
"Never got it to work.It installed and when I started it it said ""An error has occurred. Cancel.""So, I cancelled... then uninstalled it.Junk.",Yes
My impression was that I would be able to watch the Olympics through this app because I am an Amazon Prime member. Turns out I would have to buy NBC as a service through my cable provider. Not what I was expecting.,Yes
Feed kept breaking up and buffering.  Had to use outside antenna instead.  Useless app.,Yes
"I could only watch clips, not the live coverage. Don't waste your time.",Yes
"This app is crap. Trust the reviews, it is useless.",Yes
This app doesn't work and it hasn't worked for at least a month now. You just consistently get an error message and the app won't load. If I could give it 0 stars across the board I would.,Yes
"Doesn't work with Charter Spectrum.  BOOOOOOO.  I really wanted to watch the Olympics with this thing, but I guess my FireTV is useless now for that.",Yes
"Overall it's fine. However, there is a definite lag time. So if you don't mind 1+ minutes behind no big deal.",Yes
Not interested,Yes
It's clunky to find things - not organized well. Wanted to see Olympic coverage by sport and there are over 500 clips that start with the oldest (pre-Olympics) - it would take waaaaay to much time to find what I really wanted to watch. Disappointed.,Yes
Terrible! Nothing was on!,Yes
"So, I downloaded this, got the code it needed, entered it in (3 times was a charm) and it STILL never worked!  I don't have time for non-user friendly apps.  Already deleted it.  NBC, your app is GARBAGE!",Yes
Maybe because it just started but so far very disappointed with this app mostly advertising,Yes
Problem the same as nfl network.....way too much buffering,Yes
I am so disappointed with NBC and the Olympics I was looking forward to this weekend and watching Olympics all day long at you got to pay for it I don't like itit should be enough that I watch the commercials,Yes
"This does not work even when you try to log into your TV provider account; which, by the way, is WHY we bought the FIre stick - so we didn't need to use cable.  Activation code is nearly impossible to get to work.  We gave up.",Yes
"it was nice to watch the thursday night football game on the amazon fire TV. However, the game was spotty and seemed to buffer a lot, it finally just quit loading and we turned off the game. Frustrating for a football game.",Yes
"All commercials no content, what a waste.",Yes
"worst live streaming experience EVER!!!  The app kept closing, freezing, buffering, and then when it would finally play, it would play on a loop of the same 2 minutes....missed pretty much the entire football game.  So frustrating.",Yes
I liked their covering of the game. Their interrupting constantly to buffer or to get more feed. Don't know whose problem that was but it was very irritating.,Yes
The app feels clunky and unresponsive,Yes
This app no longer holds replays on Fire sticks. You can only watch certain live streams on a computer now. Its interface got so terrible that I won't consider giving them my money for full access.,Yes
"PGA Tour Live only airs featured holes, such as 15 and 17, or AM groups. I want to watch people who are in contention and there are no options to choose from other than what's mentioned above. Very disappointed",Yes
Don't bother downloading this unless you have a cable subscription!,Yes
Not happy with the app.,Yes
"UGH!! This is so frustrating. I have a cable provider, charter spectrum, and it is not compatible with this app!! We do not have cable in our bedroom so we bought the amazon fire stick as an alternative. Very disappointed when we tried to watch olympics but could not because of the app.",Yes
Well I had downloaded the app on my Amazon Fire stick specifically to be able to watch the Olympics and I'm not able to watch them live. I can watch clips from previous days and interviews but am not able to watch live. Pretty disappointed!,Yes
"The app might be free but unless you have a cable provider, it's useless. Amazon needs to advertise it as such. I was very disappointed when I got the come on email to watch the Olympics but really couldn't when I tried.",Yes
It doesn‚Äôt open,Yes
junk,Yes
"Not what I thought it was, want to cancel",Yes
A complete ripoff. Incomplete coverage with inane announcers. Thank heavens I only paid for a months worth. They concluded coverage of the first day when half of the event was still underway.,Yes
"Useless ap. In order to use this ap to watch Olympic, we have to link with TV  provider.  Hmn, if I do have my TV provider, why should I need this ap for?  If you don't have your TV provider, it expires",Yes
Very misleading about Olympic coverage. You get nothing with this app unless you have more than basic cable. Just having nbc will not get you any sports access.,Yes
Program has a few pauses but is improving. Of course the pauses come at the worst time so it's very irritating.,Yes
I like the channel for the nhl hockey but was disappointed with now local coverage,Yes
"Not what I expected, talk only",Yes
One of the worst apps ever. NBC is usually off the air on line.,Yes

too many notifications,Yes
Not a useful app it puts a ton of ads in front of everything and has a lot of buffer issues.,Yes

The show I watched shut off after 30 minutes....very disappointing.,Yes
RIP OFF - NOT FREE - you only get 30 minutes and then you have to subscribe on your cable provider,Yes

"Incredibly glitchy. Game pauses every 15 seconds, then jumps back 20 seconds, and then skips ahead. It jumps around so much I have no idea if I missed a play, or 5. So far behind other sports apps, I wonder how much effort has actually gone into this one.",Yes
"I cut the cord with a fire stick, and amazon has this worthless app for free, if you have a cord. TOTALLY USELESS. Waste of time.",Yes
"In order to watch anything on this app, you have to register with a service provider that you are getting this channel already. In other words, it's useless unless you don't need it",Yes

Downloaded to watch Super Bowl 52...1/2 the time it buffered. Super annoying.,Yes
"This app is pretty crappy. I tried to watch a football game and it was ALWAYS frozen whenever the game was on...yet the commercials always came through.

Your streaming service is horrible!,Yes
A lot of glitches in this app. It kept starting the program over anytime there was a slow connection. Did like you could play event after they had had ended.,Yes

Okay but glitchy,Yes
Way too many commercials for the amount of Olympics. Every time I have tried to watch I spend more time watching commercials than the actual sport!,Yes

This app is horrible! It never works. To try and watch the game with this is pointless. Also same commercials over and over and over and over again!,Yes

This is false advertising... It would not let me watch live events and only let you see clips of news broadcast of events that they told you ahead of time who won.

I may ask for my credit card to be refunded for this usless app...,Yes
I like it. But it kept stopping or freezing during the Superbowl game.,Yes
"It sucks! Advertised that we would be able to watch the Olympics using the App.  Instead, like everyone else, I got the ""NoAuthrz"" on every Live feed.  Only things I could watch were the 30 sec highlights/interviews/commercials.Worthless",Yes

Disliked . Free app cut me off from watching game,Yes

I did not like or dislike-- my internet provider did not approve!!,Yes

I ordered it to watch a football game and never could get it to work,Yes

"Pointless app.If you want to watch rugby for days on end, this is the app for you.",Yes

Can't watch any games MBL sucks to no games,Yes

Can't review it because you have to have a cable network to use it. If I had cable I wouldn't need this app would I!,Yes

Can‚Äôt stream live in my area.,Yes
I was prompted for access code.  I was not happy that I could not watch after that.,Yes

Never got it to work,Yes

Horrible. Could not watch anything. Hulu and Sling do not have rebroadcasting rights,Yes

"After nearly half an hour trying to get this to work, had to stop watching after 10 seconds. No sound from tv, only through phone and the sound and picture were about 4 seconds apart. The picture quality was like watching something in a 1985 commodore computer.  VERY disappointed.",Yes

It doesn‚Äôt work well,Yes

"Thank you! Thank you! Thank you Hammermill. After frustratingly futzing with the Epson printer plugin for the last hour, I found your app and it works for my Epson WF 7610 and my Kindle HD 10. In appreciation, I will buy your paper from now on.",Yes
Something came up while on my Kindle Fire's web connection that I wanted to print off. Unfortunately I didn't have a print button so I backed out and went to the app store and found this one. I use Hammermill copy paper so I thought the app would be fine. It is and I had no problems with it doing a wireless check for my printer and sending the web page to the printer.,Yes
"I FINALLY found an app that will easily print PDF's on my Kindle Fire. I was not able to get my Epson app with plug-in to even work. Anyway, thank you Hammermil for creating such a thourough, easy to install and easy to use app!",Yes
"I've got an HP C5500 all-in-one printer that connects via Bluetooth and USB to my laptop. After checking the reviews for various print apps for my Kindle Fire I decided to try this one. For me it appears to work flawlessly via Bluetooth. For testing I've printed a photo and a PDF document with no problems. Printing a test document from Office Suite was a bit more involved than just selecting 'print' since you also have to 'print' from the Hammermill application to get your output but it's not bad.I have many years of professional experience with computers and found nothing unexpected or difficult. I did have to download the appropriate driver for my printer and then some rendering software prior to printing my test document. To me, the prompts for doing this were straightforward and easy to follow. The printing setup was the easiest I've seen for setting up the configuration options for my printer. Much more straightforward than all the steps needed for changing settings from my laptop with the printer manufacturer's driver.I suppose someone as technophobic as my wife would have some difficulty but setting up printing isn't exactly for the faint of heart with all the possibilities of today's printers but this software makes it simple. A little bit of study and understanding of the info on the screens is needed for the uninitiated. A 'read me' document or menu choice for the novice wouldn't hurt.",Yes
I thought this was finally going to be a great printing app for my kindle fire. It installed easy and picked up my Canon Wifi right away. Unfortunately it wouldn't print. It kept saying &#34;broken pipe&#34;.  I have a Canon MX452 and noticed the driver only says Canon mx45. There is no mx452 option:(,Yes
"I was skeptical. I loaded the app, and then didn't do anything with it, after printing the test page to confirm the connection. A couple nights later, I was laying in bed, and thought I should perhaps try and print something. I set up a ""lets test this printer app"". Clicked print. Waited, and heard the printer come to life, and went to look. I was amazed. Whether you get this for free, or decide to purchase, it will work for you very much as described.I am using a wireless Brother printer, and a Samsung Galaxy S-5 phone.",Yes
"Could not get my Fire 10.8"" tablet to print with this app.  I even called Amazon help.  They took control of my tablet and tried for 20 min. to get the app. to work.  They do not know what is wrong.",Yes
"I use this app to print from Kindle Fire HD to Canon Pixma MG6220. This app has many functions that lets me have greater control over printing compared to other apps such as ""PrinterShare Mobile Print"". Here is the list of ""Print Hammermill"" functions that I like:1) Printing source selection from files, image gallery, web pages, Google Drive, Gmail, Email, contacts, calendar, Facebook, Box, Dropbox, OneDrive, Evernote, and SugarSync2) Multi-image-select function allows batch printing3) Printer options for paper size, printout mode (normal, grayscale, or photo), duplex mode (short edge, or long edge)4) Large, detailed print preview5) Document options for picture size (original, fit to page, 3 1/2 x 5, 4 x 6, 5 x 7, 8 x 10), page orientation, alignment (center or top left)6) Printing protocol (LPD, IPP, BJNP, or WRPT) -- This is VERY USEFUL!!I've tried other printing apps (Easy Cloud Print, Cloud Print, Pixma Print, Canon Print Service, PrintShare Mobile Print), and I think this app is the best one for me!!",Yes
They wanted me to pay for something that worked and was dependable. No thanks. I thought we could get this app for free. Never worked without asking for more.,Yes
"I found this app when I needed to replace my PrintBot app when it stopped working, and I wish I had found the Hammermill app at the very beginning. Setup is easy if it can find your printer. It doesn't locate all Wi-Fi printers, but kudos for having a manual setup option. The printing itself is easy, and allows you to see previews. I like other ability to print both in apps and from the print app proper. The interface is nice and professional, and the Hammermill adverts are not irritating. I appreciate the options of only printing certain pages or choosing to print in black and white or color. It felt more like printing from my laptop than from the Kindle. l would like to see an option to change print quality, especially for photos, but all in all, this is one of the best print apps out there.",Yes
It is helping me print using my kindle fire 8. Since my printer is not wireless I had a little trouble understanding and getting connected. Could not have been able to print without this app.,Yes
I thought it says the hap was free but they want me to pay 4.99,Yes
Haven't figured a way to control size yet.,Yes
Would like to have more printer control,Yes
"This is great and was so easy to set up!! I am not tech savey so if I can do it so can u. Never thought I could use a Kindle to print.  Again great app,and for free how can u go wrong!!!",Yes
"Great product, allows more control of the print outcome vs. others I've tried. I would recommend this product to anyone. AWESOME.",Yes
"I think this is a great app.  I have a kindle and I am very pleased with it, a time saver as well.  I placed an online order and saved the confirmation to my bookmarks. I was curious as to how to print that conformation page and played around trying to figure just how to do that.  I looked all over the menu page of the app and tapped on several of the listed and nothing led me to what I needed.  I went back to my bookmarks and hit the share button and it gave me a list of who I wanted to share with and tapped the Print Hammermil.  It printed it  just fine, no problems at all.  I was hoping there was an app of this nature would come along.  I not a teckie but I recommend this app.  People friendly not difficult at all to use.",Yes
"I downloaded this app in July of 2014 and could never get it to work with my Canon MP810 and my Kindle, via Bluetooth. After replacing my 8-year-old Canon with a Canon Maxify 2020 this week, I thought I'd try again. I had to use Hammermill's generic drivers, but the app found my new Canon immediately and I can now print from my 2nd Gen Kindle Fire. If you have a 2nd Gen Kindle Fire and a Canon printer, don't bother with the Canon Print Plug-in, which is only compatible with 3rd Gen and later. The Hammermill app is working for me beautifully.",Yes
App will not download after 5 attempts and no actionable clue as to why,Yes
"Prints on any network. Easy to navigate. I had printed on an Iphone and the controls are similar. One additional step, just pick the local workgroup, no biggie, I recommend it.",Yes
I was very proud of myself for installing & using this app. It was easier than I thought.,Yes
works great gives full control of your printer,Yes
"Never thought it would be this easy to print from my Kindle Fire HD to my computer printer.  This app was easy to download, install and then use.  Great addition for the Kindle!",Yes
"This app wanted access to every conceivable part of my phone. Network is fine. Boot logs, status and identity and more is not.I printed what I needed and deleted it.Shame on the developers.The star is because it did print a file. But if I could give it zero, I would.",Yes
When the other app did not work with my Brother printer this one did. Success = Satisfaction.,Yes
Do they really need to be able to access and control everything on my phone? I will not give permission for everything!,Yes
"Re: Canon PIXIMA MX922, having trouble understanding why this app doesn't work in my Kindle. Keeps telling me to turn off Wi-Fi and connect a printer cable to the computer. Well the printer will not allow both Wi-Fi to be on and to use the cable. Wi-Fi is most important so had no choice but to discard this app. Sad.",Yes
I thought this would be cool.  It does take up space in my memory. But it doesn't print.,Yes
Never thought it would work so well!  Amazing!  And it's a free product!,Yes
Looks good does nothing...yahoo has a site safety warning on it!!,Yes
"I found a manual for my bread maker and needed to print it out. I thought for a few minutes, then knew I needed some app for me to print out.I downloaded it, then it found my Epson workforce 545, and my Canon . I used the Epson printer and was able to print it out.I am going to load this in all my tablets I have. This app is simply the easiest to use, I love it.",Yes
"Was very happy to add print capability to my Kindle Fire HD, but disappointed that it only worked with my AOL email account.  My more current GMAIL account kept rejecting the application as asecurity risk.",Yes
Really like the features that are offered.  Only used a couple of times so far and it is far better than e-print.  Looking forward to using it more often and exploring the many features it offers. Definitely would recommend it to my friends.,Yes
This app didn't work. It wouldn't print anything. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I thought it was a waste of time.,Yes
It works on my Fire Kindle which is a challenge in itself.,Yes
Creating docs no,Yes
I'm still trying different files to see what i can do as opposed to Microsoft Office I had on my PC. Working a file from a android style tablet has many challenges.,Yes
I thought I had found a decent word processing app for my kindle....wrong.  Right up until I wanted to print everything was great.  Easy to use and looked a lot like Microsoft word.  I go to print and of course I can't because I need to have a subscription for their premium service.  What a joke.,Yes
"Ok app for free. Works as expected for a free app. There are some problems, but all in all so far I have not had any major issues. Running on a Kindle Fire, with multiple different documents transferred over from the old one via Bluetooth. The app pickup those and read them fine. So for What I wanted it is working. I have copied and pasted a few things onto documents without issues. I have not up graded yet, but I may later if it continues to work this well. Only reason I have it 3 stars is because of the fact I had to sign into Facebook to continue using it and it continues to ask me to up grade. Some actions are just obnoxious.",Yes
"If I could I wouldn't give it any stars. downloaded this app for creating a resume. It will not let me save it to my documents, therefore I am not allowed to attach it to anything. If I want to transfer it to where I need it I have to pay a fee. A monthly subscription. Not worth getting if you can't even attach your documents or send them.",Yes
"This is a free app that gives your tablet, Kindle etc good basic word processing ability. I find it to be a good app to take notes when I am traveling. And creating simple documents. Once you have the free app you also have the option to get the premium package for a monthly fee. I haven't found that it necessary to get the premium package yet but am pleased that I have the option to upgrade. I would recommend this app.",Yes
Loved this app and thought it was perfect for use with my tablet until I tried to print a document!  Then there was a $4 charge per month just to be able to print!  Not exactly a free app.  So disappointed.√∞??¬¢,Yes
"The best office app for Fire tablets, including the best and easiest to use PDF reader.The word processor and spreadsheet work best for display and simple entry/editing due to the nature of tablet computing.",Yes
"Sure it has a share button, but I'm a book editor, and I work for a publisher. I also freelance. I need to get both my publisher and my clients CLEAN, easy to open document attachments. So, I tapped the *send as attachment* button and ZOOOM! Away went a white screen that said, well, who knows what because it just whipped up off the top of my screen.So I thought, okay...I'll just send them a link.I thought I'd send it to myself first to see how easy this would be for my clients to use.So, I tap the appropriate button to send it to myself and get to preview before it sends. I figured I would click the link rather than waiting, and do you know what happens instead of sending a link to my document to my boss and my client?They are taken to THIS PAGE TO DOWNLOAD THE APP!!!This ANGERS ME TO NO END! I'm trying to use this as a PROFESSIONAL BUSINESS TOOL & THE COMPANY IS USING ME TO PASS THE WORD ABOUT THEIR PRODUCT?And the kicker is...the people I'm sending the document to use LAPTOPS or DESKTOPS and have no use for this!I didn't see my document attached, or a link to it, in the email, either. The ONLY THING there was a link to the landing page to download this app!I DID have some nice things to say about it - like, it's the only APP I found that lets me track changed (which my industry uses constantly), but what good is it if I can't get the doc back to my boss or client after it's completed? I don't get paid. In fact, I could get FIRED! And LOSE clients for sending them SPAM.THANKS A LOT MOBI!",Yes
This app is a beautiful thing.  Even I was able to use it first time out. (69 years old and no tech whiz.)  Thanks for creating it.,Yes
"I have this Kindle for 2 years now . And I really needed to find ways for it to be helpful in my career status. I really needed help. I'm use to having word on my computer. Without knowing which apps to choose, I was confused I couldn't understand a way to help me. Low and behold, I created an email with Outlook and my kindle became so familiar to me. Everything is coming together with this wonderful app. I so new to it. So I have an lot of learning to do with it. Thank you for developing this usuable app for the working world and home life. I will add more later.",Yes
"This app starts awesome I wanted a way to capture my thoughts while on the go, I started a new d o document and it was great. Until I went to add to it the next day, I had to download another app in order to even open the document, then it kept coming up with errors because the default font isn't available in the free app",Yes
"Specifically you cannot print a doc and more specifically the User Manual pdf is in a witness protection program - you can only read it on your device.  It's not available on the Internet.  In 2014? Really?  You can't download it from their web site? Sooo 20th Century.That said, the free version 7.5 DOES indeed edit M$Word docs despite all the negative reviews here.  Since I'm running it on a Galaxy 5 smartpnone not a tablet, I haven't tried an Excel or PPT file.  8-)",Yes
"I'm not real happy with the way the controls work.  Sometimes the background color goes right over the controls, and you have no alternative but to exit.  Also, I still don't know what the dropper is for.  It's kind of fun to use, and not too hard once you get going.",Yes
"This app allows for a test drive which runs smoothly and I loved it in the run but once I downloaded it I was unable to even draw all I could do was upload images and it kept on trying to save which I clicked ""not save"" and it would open up to choosing a pic??? Very frustrating especially since I couldn't even get a line to show up....please fix for kindle fire,Thank you",Yes
It's so boring!  Hard to control! I absolutely hate it!  Looks easy but not! I Would NOT Recommend Getting it!!,Yes
Not at all what I thought. I wanted to use this to learn to draw. Not going to happen. I will be deleting this one.,Yes
I was unable to sketch anything very well.  I didn't feel I had near good enough control of the wand.,Yes
I downloaded this for my 10 year old and he loves it and can easily navigate the app independently,Yes
It is super good I thought at first it didn't work and I tried it it work and I only got on it cause my friend asked me to and I was surprised it actually worked this app is the best.,Yes
Skype in action :-)looking good and very handy while using with my new kindlefire HD. Still improvements required for video chatting in 2g networks for other devices.,Yes
"Skype, for Kindle hd, was okay before recent update.  After update, multi-tasking is non existent, there is no volume control and calls constantly drop.  I wish there was an option to go back to the previous update.  Please stop back tracking, Skype, and fix these issues.",Yes
"The worst app I have. Every time, and I mean every time, I get an incoming call Skype crashes! And it wouldn't even surprise me if my Skype crashes during a call. If it crashes while turning on. If it is not reactive at all when I try to call someone. Like there isn't even a ring tone when I call someone do I sit there in awkward silence wondering if I pressed the call button and suddenly my friends voice is on the other side just.... sudden! Or if I am still seeing no reaction once I press the call button I press it twice and then it non stop calls my friend no matter how I try to hang up, I have to turn off my kindle to get it to stop calling!If it aren't for necessity, it would never come back on my kindle I hate this thing so much",Yes
Disappointed. I'd like to know why it is saying I have 20 free remaining video messages left? I thought Skype to Skype video messages were a;ways free?,Yes
"I have never had problems with Skype until using this app. Random shut downs on mine and my husband's end (ipad 2), freezing, and blackout/muted moments. I was excited to be able to talk to my husband who is over seas but Skype makes it so frustraing and at times impossible to video or even simply to voice chat. I thought maybe it was the distance but have tried local with just as many problems. I wish there was a solid alternative.",Yes
"I bought two Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" 32G tablets for my husband and I for Christmas presents.  He is a marine, I thought that for his deployment this would be great for entertainment and communication.  This app has worked correctly once.  Just one single time.  The speakers stopped putting out what he was saying, the screen freezes, calls are ""busy"" over and over again (even though we confirmed the other person is not making a call).  I'll be deleting this App and might try to re-download, but I don't have much faith.This is separate from the Skype review - but I'm incredibly disappointed with my Kindle over all.  It seems that most things don't work - except for things eligible for purchase off of Amazon.  I am an avid PC/Android user - and I hate to say it - but I wish I had just bought an IPAD.",Yes
"This app needs serious work. It should not only work for certain devices, it's not fair! I have the new kindle fire HDX 7&#34; and I very disappointed. The person I call can see me fine but I can't see her. The video and the audio are not in sync with each other so as I talk the action follows10 seconds  later. It's annoying. Please fix this app. I rather just have the Google play store apps",Yes
"I've had my kindle fire hd for around a year now and the skype app has always been terrible. It crashes a lot for no reason and the volume controls are ridiculous. With every update it gets worse and the most recent one is a train wreck. Constantly crashing and freezing, webcam function freezese and doesn't work. It's beyond frustrating.",Yes
It was so hard to access nowadays to skype thru my kindle fire hd please make a necessary action for this. The reason why i bought this tablet because i saw their ads on tv that skype is accessible on this tablet thanks,Yes
I'm trying to get a hold of my best friend in the middle east and I keep getting an insufficient funds message on kindle HDX. I thought Skype was free.,Yes
"I got a kindle to take travelling with me, partly to use Skype to keep in touch with home. All worked brilliantly till an automatic up date, supposedly making Skype better for the tablet, downloaded it's self. I've paid to have a number on Skype and do use credit to make some calls and send texts, but I've found that being a paying customer means nothing to Skype, I am evidently worthless to them.  It was near impossible to contact anyone at Skype, it's really hard to get to the point that you can actually communicate with someone and when I finally did they weren't helpful at all.  So I got in touch with Amazon, they were great and gave me a way to overcome the problems I've been having. Albeit a temporary fix.The problems I've had have included, not being able to sign in, the control panel disappearing so I cannot sign in or out (once signed out automatically there was no way to sign back in), see what credit I have or access my profile. Losing all records of any texts that I have sent and paid for. The programme constantly crashes.Having got home from travelling I have again contacted Skype to try and resolve the problem.  Several emails have been exchanged, they have collected data from me about the problem and now have closed the case without having resolved the problem at all. I have lost money because of the problems I've had, directly from my Skype credit, I shall never see that again.  Skype is a disgrace, if anything goes wrong with the programme they are useless, it appears to be a waste of time contacting them, they don't understand their own product.",Yes

"Since Skype has been updated I've faced a bunch of problems. One problem is that the volume is high, it doesn't matter if I put the volume on zero I can still hear the person on the other line loudly. Another problem that I have is that as soon as you click on the app it signs in automatically. If someone was to click on my Skype they would be able to access my messages and contacts immediately.  I want my privacy. Another problem is that it continuously crashes for no apparent reason. One minutes it's working and the next it's sending you a message that says ""Skype is not responding would you like to close it"" if you say yes it closes and if you don't the message will continue to pop up. Before the update I also noticed that Skype would just hang up my calls and I thought it was my internet connection but after reading numerous reviews I realize that I'm not the only one with this problem. Skype needs to be fixed immediately. The company should fix all the glitches before putting it back in the Appstore.",Yes
Works perfectly. You can chat see your other friends and family. Now I can chat with my sister and uncles. The kindle fire VS is great. I'm so glad. If you were having second thoughts about getting it. Then yes you should.definitely get it.,Yes
"If you have an older version of Skype, keep it. The newer version/update is absolutely awful. No way to control the volume, and it constantly crashes. I've written to Amazon, but they continue to make it available in prominent position in their app store. DON'T DOWNLOAD IT!",Yes
"At first I had a little trouble getting use to it, but then--WOW! It's fast, and lets me send my whole message. I am technology challenged, so thank you for this.",Yes
"I was looking for a complete communications app. This is OK for text, but totally unacceptable for voice on the Kindle Fire as the volume is too low to be usable. Initially, I thought the Kindle (Fire HD8, 7th gen) was defective, but found that the volume is fine on all other apps",Yes
"I thought this would be great but no, it doesn't bring up all my contacts, just 2?? And when I tried to text one of these people it just didn't work.Not fit for purpose.",Yes
"I liked it, though it was kinda confusing for me at least. I thought it was really cool, and I think you guys should try it. and if you don't like it then that's just your opinion and this is mine so.....listen to me if you want but you don't have too.:)",Yes
So the new update came and I thought it was gonna be good but it will not load,Yes
"I was surprised but it does work.  I havent listed my contacts in it, but the sms works well .  Need to check thesecurity on it just to be sure, but so far so good.  I have a phone number. 'I'll keep you updated.",Yes
Not wht I thought,Yes
This app is great thank you for creating it and helping me reach my friends.,Yes
I thought this app was a scam at first but it works it's mush better than a phone except it's not portable it works like a phone you can call and text and face time get it now.,Yes
"Over all, the app works pretty good. Sometimes it has a problem understanding what you say. I'm using it on a Kindle Fire HDX.",Yes
"choosing a language - has a good mix; point and peck-scrambles placement of answers; no typing (misspelling) involved; only language immersion practiced with the right level of repetition without becoming ""annoying/frustrating""",Yes
"I like the app. It was more lessons than I thought I would get with a free app. I am partial to Rosetta Stone having used it before but i do believe it is a good program. But of course they put hard sell on you via e-mail for the full version. But hey, isn't that part of the reason they're offering a free app?",Yes
"I love the app on Rosetta stone, it challenges you. I'm of Hispanic decent so it's easy but a little challenging., without the pictures it would be harder. The app is great.",Yes
"This app runs like crap on my kindle. I already use 'Duolingo' and 'Memrise' with 'Itranslate' to supplement my vocabulary, but I thought I'd give it a go because of its popularity. It wasn't worth it. It's big, and very slow. I spent more time looking at a black loading screen than I did actually learning. If you want an app that will teach you a language, I suggest the ones I mentioned above. They're similar in style, but each a bit different to cater to different learning styles, and both are WAAAAY better than Rosetta stone. Memrise in particular is pretty awesome, because it offers courses on tons of subjects, not just language. Don't waste your time with Rosetta. Es nicht sehr gut.",Yes
"Wasn't what I thought! A lot of hidden charges. That's about it, other than who is really benefiting here not I.",Yes
"It may be difficult starting out with a new language. I downloaded this to learn Korean a language I did not know at all and I feel like I'm getting the hang of it a little bit. But it is coming along. For a language I was familiar with, Spanish, it was a breeze but a lot easier to understand. Overall I love the app! I have no problems with it understanding what I am saying.",Yes
When I started Rosetta Stone I thought it was going to be like other experiences where it would take a long time. To my surprise I'm almost done with the first lesson and I just started today. Rosetta Stone is the fastest way to learn a language.,Yes
Make sure you use the online offer...it will expire after 6 months. I thought I could save it until I was ready. Go all in or don't buy it.The at home section is easy to use so if you apply the time you will learn. Not sure how the application online would go - was nervous about that part.,Yes
So far I have not had as much opportunity as I thought I would to use the program it's getting three stars because what I've listen to so far is good.,Yes
Great way to challenge you to know the difference between genders and single or plural! And proper pronunciation and enunciation and articulation.,Yes
"We have the desktop Rosetta, & added the Kindle & phone app recently. We paid $25 for three months' use of the app. I love practicing my French on my Kindle. I would have thought this would have been included in the price of the desktop version. It is pricey, but it's worth it at this point. I'll see later on if I'll want to continue paying for the app.",Yes
"Uplifting, positive and informative, true to human nature. Thanks TED",Yes
Many brief thought provoking presentations.great app,Yes
"Interesting, educational talks, Intellectually stimulating and thought provoking.",Yes
This app is interesting and it challenges you at times.,Yes
Love learning. Words for thought. Imagination lite up by possiblities,Yes
"Love TED, I always thought TED was just for the screaming Liberal?  I am wrong.. :-)  right filled minds are hear also!",Yes
Wonderful videos worth exploring!!,Yes
"TED TV opens up a universe of the best human thought.  It's mind expanding, soul expanding ideas that elevates us all.",Yes
TED is continually creating some of the best content on the internet. Love having acces to the videos on my fire stick.,Yes
"I love how it pushes me to learn,  but let's me control it. Couldn't be better!",Yes
I wanted to get some foundation before I went into college classes next semester which means I have no background at all in the language and still have found the lessons easy to follow and learn with enough challenge you really feel like you are picking something up.,Yes
First off it free so thats a big plus.  Two its a lot better than other language apps and you can challenge other friends which is a big motivator.,Yes
You learn! It's easy and fun and you'll spend far more time on it than you planned or thought you would in individual sessions.,Yes
"Awesome app!! Best online foreign language app ever and  best yet it's free!!! I have been using this app for a year and a half and I am already almost fluent. Though you cannot rely on this app alone to achieve fluency, it will provide an excellent foundation that you may use to launch you into other spanish media such as books, music, and movies. This app moved my life in a new direction, led to new friendships (multicultural), and more.  √Ç¬°Buena suerte!",Yes
It's so easy to use that I'm learning quicker than I thought I could.,Yes
"I actually look forward to practicing, which something I never expected. I thought it would feel like a chore the whole time, but Duolingo mixes up the activities so that learning doesn't get stagnant or boring.",Yes
"Not exactly educational, interesting novelty.",Yes
"Tried to access via the Tablet way. Perhaps my tablet - an earlier edition - is not sufficient to log on......Will try at a later date.In the interim, looks interesting, would really like to see the program in action.",Yes
"I love it. The app is free and I am learning how to pronounce  the words not just read and guess. To really learn the language, some practice every day is super important. I thought I would try this  instead of spending hundreds on other apps or courses out there.",Yes
Absolutely wonderful! I am learning! I feel challenged! I am proud of my streak!,Yes
Easy to incorporate into day and fun to challenge friends.,Yes
was good except it seemed to take control and I did not like that feature,Yes
For a free app this language learner is awesome. My cousin told me about it when I asked him what he thought of that over priced one everyone has seen on TV but I will reframe from calling it by name. They also have an app but sadly Duolingo is much easier and friendlier to use. I've learned so much from this app already and cant wait to put some of it into practice. If you have ever wanted to learn a new language Duolingo is your best choice for apps.,Yes
"Duolingo is an amazing app! At first I thought I was just wasting my time but now I look at it and a great USE of time. One thing I would add is the variety of languages. Maybe you should add Japanese, Korean, Chinese.",Yes
Easy to use and progress through the lessens. I need a little help understanding the different endings for pronouns and gender but in general this is really helpful.,Yes
"I always wanted to learn another language but when my French teacher said that I would never learn another language, I thought she might be right, until Duolingo. I'm only on level 10, but I'M ON LEVEL 10!!!. One day I hope that I can run into my French teacher and lecturer her in all the languages that I am learning!!! I should probably thank her for pushing me to prove her wrong!",Yes
"I originally downloaded this app to help me brush up on my French, which is pretty rusty after 15 years of little to no use, and my Spanish, which is just a little rusty after a year of little to no use. I am somewhat pleased with this app. I don't like it as much as I like my French and Spanish classes, but as far as a language tutor, it's great. The only thing lacking in this app is that it doesn't explain the conjugations of verbs with respect to pronouns. For instance--and I'm going to use Spanish as an example here--it doesn't explain why the verb 'ser' gets conjugated to 'eres' when you say ""tu eres,"" or why it gets conjugated to 'somos' when you say, ""nosotros somos."" If it explained the process of conjugation for each language, that would make the app SO MUCH better and also help newbies have a fuller understanding of the language they are trying to learn. Anyone who doesn't know the first thing about other languages is going to think that this app is great, but if you are like me and you have had formal classes before, you will know that this app is seriously lacking. Formal classes give you the fundamental principles of the language to help you, and one of those fundamentals is learning conjugation so that you will not only understand what you're saying, but WHY you're saying it that way. I know this app isn't the same as a formal class, but if the developers are going to market it as an alternative to expensive formal classes, then they need to at least offer better teaching tools within the app.",Yes
"Not something I√¢??m really into. I thought they√¢??d be more of what Food Network has, game shows , diners drive in and dives etc.It is a tutorial cooking channel.",Yes
"The app just closes whenever I try to pic a chef. There's nowhere for me to log in to personalize my stuff. I thought it was a good recipe app but all I got was a box that says ""The kitchen has stopped"" whenever I try to do anything.",Yes
"This app is ok. I thought it would be fab but I have been a bit disappointed with it. I just want to be able to find good recipes easy to make. I don't feel picking a chef, and doing all that is necessary. It's a bit of a waste of time.",Yes
Why bother creating an app with pre-recorded contents that requires subscription. Youtube has a lot more pro cooking videos and they are free. Uninstalled!,Yes
"Great app-Bad programmingOn a Galaxy Tab 2 7""The app generates an error message --- License Invalid, purchase app .Options on popup cancel or buy at google play.Does not recognise the Amazon licenseA worse programming error than I thought - THE WRONG POPUP FOR THE ERROR.Explaination: I typo my password creating the user on foodnetwork.com. When I tried to login through the app and the user info didn't match. I got the above error. Popup should have read login error on foodnetwork.com - check your user info @ foodnetwork.com. NOT license invaid",Yes
Not exactly what I thought it was going to be.,Yes
I didn't like this app at all.I didn't keep it . It didn't have any recipes like I thought it would.,Yes
"Pro satisfaction guarantee! Unless, of course, you pay with your apple account. Can't manage shopping list on the web app. The first time I created a list using my iPhone it did not pull in quantities. How many packages of frozen spinach do I need to buy? Pro would be a really good free version! Deleting my account and not wasting my time trying to get a refund.",Yes
Wasn't what I thought it would be,Yes
This app works wonders for my phone to my tv I can control my tv from rooms away truely love this app. But this app does have to many pop ups.,Yes
"This is a great app. High quality resolution and sound. Only 2 problems, and theyre small...1. Whenever I open the app it takes about 5 mins on avg just to open the app and get started.2. It dulls the color slightly. Not a big deal , just something I noticed and thought maybe they could change?Overall very good app. I would recommend it!!",Yes
"This recorder is awesome i thought ""great another fake one"" but it worked!",Yes
I thought this was. Turned out the audio sounds like a possessed person. The  is Fix  pls FAM.,Yes
It needs a little help with the controls but it is fine after u get it. GREAT!!!!,Yes
Good for making YouTube Videos And Interesting Commentary. In All A Great App Totally Recomend It For Begginers Just One Thing Maybe A Face Cam For All Those Funny Reactions.√∞???√∞???,Yes
The volume when i rec sounds choppy and i have parent controls on so i can only download this :(  also when i try to pause and end recording and watch video it doesn't pause in the vid. please fix both things please.,Yes
It takes like a minute to load and every time I try to make a video on a game the controls go away so it would be nice if y'all four fix that.Thx,Yes
It was laggy. What I mean is that I ran it on my fire tv stick specifically to watch the superbowl and the pre-game stuff leading up to it. The audio was multiple seconds behind the video which made it difficult because entire sentences where spoke before I actually heard them.  I thought maybe if I restart that would clear it up. Sadly no. The app was bad enough I just went ahead and used my over the air antenna instead. I wanted this app to work well. But it did not. I cannot recommend it at this time as a result. I suggest steer clear of this application. It was made available for the superbowl and failed.,Yes
Was different than I thought it would be. Did not have any live games,Yes
"Great product, smooth transaction",Yes
"Unable to watch any games, thought it was something else.",Yes
"The show (The Good Fight) often stuttered (other shows did not so it wasn't a system-wide data transfer issue) and the commercials ALWAYS did.  Drove me nuts.  Their tech support could not solve the problem and higher-level support did not call back to help, as they said they would.  Plus, the Forward/Reverse/Play/Pause interface for this site with the Fire Stick is terrible.  I had a hard time controlling where I wanted to go, unlike any other service I've ever had.  WAY too complicated.  The whole experience was a giant headache.  Get it together, CBS.",Yes
Just what I thought this app would . It gives me the scores and update of my favorite teams.  Thanks cbs.,Yes
I thought getting it all signed up was confusing. I√¢??ve only had it three days. So far so good!!! We will see we got it mainly to follow Chicogo Cubs season. Tried others and discontinued because of all the stopping and starting.,Yes
It√¢??s great we get all the locals and cable channels we used to have at a fraction of the price. My husband gets his sports channels too. We have recording and cloud preferences too,Yes
We tried fubo as our cable is no longer getting our favorite sports and tv shows. As football season is kicking off we thought this would be the answer. Very disappointed that the live sports wasn√¢??t what we expected.,Yes
The way it was advertised I thought I could stream out of market NFL but you cannot. Glad  only did the trial because it was not what I wanted at all.,Yes
"We did not find this service at all easy to use and found it too difficult to navigate without the traditional remote.Also, the freezing of the video, randomly, throughout a show, was too annoying to ignore.",Yes
Thought I could get football game not in my local lineup,Yes
For my first try of this app I thought it was very good and I will use it more.,Yes
Live World Cup action with rewind and pause capability.,Yes
Charter has to much control there is to few stations can't watch racing bummer,Yes
thought I could watch live NFL football games great ,Yes
"Worst app ever , why do I have to go find my phone or laptop to sign in every f***ing time I want to check in on the progress of a game ? I have 30 Mbps internet and still get stop and game action on my Fire tv.",Yes
Not what I thought it would be.,Yes
"App is incredibly glitchy. Watching live games is completely unreliable as it will constantly cut back to scenes that occurred about 10 seconds ago, and then jump right back to the live action. NBC really needs to update this app.",Yes
tried to download the app but could not thought It would pick up off my wi fi but would never work just got to figure out how to cancel,Yes
"I thought I could watch a game from the day before, but you have to get permission from your cable provider or codes or something stupid like that.  Waste of time. If you want to watch 30 second clips of anything get this app. Why offer it if you can't watch anything?",Yes
"Only works if you have cable or satellite TV.  There seems to be no way to pay for it independently.  If I had cable, I would not need this ...",Yes
Didn't have the access I thought I did!,Yes
"Couldn't watch as many of the Olympic highlights as I thought. My fault for not having cable, though ;)",Yes
"Works great, just as advertised.  Installing APPS can be difficult, but likely the same for all such systems.  Video and audio quality is excellent.  FF or REW is a little slow and not easy to control.",Yes
"I don't really watch this to much, like i thought I would.",Yes
This is false advertising... It would not let me watch live events and only let you see clips of news broadcast of events that they told you ahead of time who won.  If i had a service subscriber i would not need this app..... Thats why i bought it to watch the Olympic's... thru netflix I thought.  I may ask for my credit card to be refunded for this usless app...,Yes
I thought it was going to give free live sports but it only let me view part of the game. Picture quality was great though.,Yes
"As reported previously, no audioNot a problem if you have a Bluetooth speakerHowever, as also reported, the video lags, creating image distortion and audio lag which is not a problem for short videos but would be hell if trying to view a movie or other lengthy videoOverall, mehIt did what I wanted",Yes
"Did a great job ,only setback was I thought the entire app was free and was a little surprised when I had to purchase the cleaner",Yes
"Works well, really speeds up my kindle without creating any issues",Yes
This app does do what it says it will do. However I wish there was an option to buy the app to eliminate the adds and include options to better control when it runs.,Yes
Good buy.......runs efficiently and restores confidence in safety of keeping my device clean from suspicious files,Yes
Amazed at quickness of the process is to analyzed the status of the tablet. Pleased that when diagnosis is completed that I get a status report and can choose the next operation.?,Yes
For the cost of is better than nothing. Prefer 360security but I guess it does not work on tablets.,Yes
Even paying the small price for the full version is worth every penny. Great protection for your Fire tablet. Yep it does make a difference in speed.,Yes
"After the app scanned my fire, it opened a screen to purchase the rest of the app, but even that didn't work.Does amazon have no interest in quality control on the apps from its store?",Yes
"The two IP cameras are working well with MIPC App. I wanted something better. Since the tinyCam free app did not have the PTZ controls, I bought the tinyCam Pro. It does not work. It crashes after less than 1 minute saying it is unable to communicate with the camera. I have tried playing with all settings but no change. I made sure that the MIPC app was not running on the other phone, going so far as to turn off that phone, so there would be no interference.tinyCam PRO, in its current form (Dec 15, 2020) is a fundamentally unreliable product. It may have worked in some previous versions with some older ip cameras, but the current version does not work with current hardware. Don't waste your time or money.",Yes
"This turned my FireTV into a very quick and easy way for me to get a quick visual of mysecurity cameras. For the price it even has some features that could make it a dedicatedsecurity DVR if you have a NAS. I don't use those features, but they do show up. The ability to add a variety of cameras using everything from H264 to MPEG painlessly is worth $3.",Yes
I had the FREE version and upgraded to be able to pan and tilt my cameras.  I like the zoom feature also.  I have not used all the available controls included but will investigate those soon.,Yes
I Love that i can see mysecurity cameras on my big screen via this app on my Amazon Fire TV,Yes
"This allows me to monitor IP cameras around my home. It lacks some controls, but is decent at providing the needed service.",Yes
Really like this app. Using with two Foscam cameras.  Using app mostly with Kindle Fire hd.  I have had it lock up the tablet on a few occasions when the tablet sat idle for a while. Only solution was to force a power off. It would be good to have the controls recognize if the camera has been flipped and mirrored. Still give the app a 5 star rating.best,Yes
"Great phone application for our Foscam cameras.  We have two Foscam cameras and used the embedded DDNS on both.  I changed the ports (from the default) on both cameras forsecurity and this application allows easy configuration on unusual port numbers.  The only problem is that moving the camera on the application sometimes results in placing it Patrol mode (where it continuously scans).  But, ""free"" is still a lot better than paying for Blue Iris.",Yes
Great app.  Very smooth with foscams.  Controls mic and speakers very well. Love the Chromecast function.,Yes
"I'm unable to use it. I'm a writer and everything I type into is lost to it. I can read within the program but I can't copy & paste, attach, email, or send to anything else so I essentially have lost hours worth of work.I tried the free version and I'm not paying a year's subscription for something that doesn't work. I'm disabled. I live on SSI so I'm not made of money. It's false advertising to say it's free and then lock an individual's work within the program so that it's irretrievable without paying for a year's subscription.There is nothing user friendly about it. I've used many word processor programs and never had a problem understanding them. This one makes no sense at all. The only reason I keep on my Kindle is so don't lose my work completely.",Yes
"I was looking for office software that would function on a tablet, which I travel with more now than I do the laptop. The software is good and works well while creating or editing your document. The trouble is moving your document from your tablet to a cloud (OneDrive or Dropbox e.g.) so that you can share it with others and download it to your laptop or PC. The company offering the product (MobiSystems) doesn't make it plain upfront, but you need another app of theirs called File Commander to do this. After about an hour of effort, I stumbled upon it. Now you know upfront.",Yes
"IT is very functional like on my PC, however the screen is small and creating a spreadsheet is not practical, however, I can send one I have already created and open it and then have it on the Fire HD Tablet.",Yes
"I was rather amazed at how easy to use this app was. Using only the free version, thus far, I've been able to write up a fairly long article for publication. At one point I thought I had lost the entire thing - I had saved much earlier, but was very pleased and surprised when I pulled the app back up to find I was exactly where I had left off.A few more instructions would be appropriate such as setting up ""cloud"" and retrieving from the ozone.  Also, copy/paste and the ability to move words, sentences and paragraphs around would be appreciated.This is a somewhat large app, so be sure you've the available room for it. If you tend to write a lot of reports or articles, and you're short on room, I'd find something to send to the Netherworld and get this app.Since I've not used any of the other functions, I cannot accurately rate them.  I am basing this review solely on the word processing ability which is why I downloaded it in the first place.",Yes
"I thought zi had bought this program. Unfortunately, it has disappeared from my phone. I am not very compuyer savvy so the likelihood of me getting back are not going to happen. I only looked at it once since it was put on my phone.",Yes
It is not what I thought it was. I thought it was Microsoft.  It should be labeled the Amazon office suite. I am very disappointed and would not recommend it to anyone.,Yes
Thought it would help with my grammar errors. It didn't.,Yes
I am not a person who has a hard time understanding a program. but this one just has me wondering how to use it.,Yes
This app is easy to use and has a lot of great features for creating and editing documents.,Yes
"Going back to 2012, there were file management functions in the pre-installed and the upgrade versions of OfficeSuite. It was nice. Then late in 2015 I had the new version notification for Pro. Wow, now I don't have file management anymore (without buying &#34;File Commander&#34;). Well my request for help was answered with questions about version and operating system but I thought that I gave very clear answers. I'm still waiting for a solution. By the way, the new interface is clutzy, definitely a worse version than I had. Incidentally the old interface is still to be found on Amazon's pre-installed version on my Kindle but after the &#34;update&#34;, that version won't open pdf files. Amazon won't deal with it because there are newer Kindles sold apparently without OfficeSuite. The new free version will read pdf files, but also no file management. There's an offer to upgrade to OfficeSuite Premium. What's that?",Yes
Suits my needs.  I thought my Kindle came with a basic office app and was surprised when I could open a simple Word document. The Mayday folks found everything I needed.  Thanks Amazon.,Yes
Not what i5thought it wa,Yes
This qpp didn't work as I thought it would.  This app is difficult to work,Yes
"Not worth downloading. There is nothing available without paying for the services. Not even spell check. So basically it's like using a notepad and jotting down your thoughts. Much better apps for ""free"" I'm sure.",Yes
"I felt this was a way to sneak in urges to buy the better version of the various products. So it felt like an invasive action; posing as ""free"" it was an opportunity to take time and energy to bug me saying: well if you really want this product you need to buy the master version. Why not be honest and just advertize the real product up front? Now, however, I am totally dis-inclined to buy any of the products, having gotten the bad taste of dishonesty in my mouth. (O, and one simple thing that did work came with streaming ads at the bottom)",Yes
"After creating a spread sheet, saved it and when I later went back to continue my work I could not open it. I created another thinking I saved it wrong and same thing happened. I then did a trial word document careful to pay attention to everything again thinking I did something wrong. No luck and could not find help anywhere. I found it difficult to navigate trying to find anything. At one point I got somewhere and saw a.thumbnail of my documents but could not open, once I left that screen I couldn't find my way back. I gave up. There's got to be something easier out there.'",Yes
"It's okay for free, does the job if you like to use a tablet for creating documents on the go.  The free version doesn't allow you to print or include pics, but you can email the documents to yourself, then open the documents on another computer.  From there, you can print or add pics.",Yes
"Incessant ads to upgrade to paid version highly annoying.  Imperfect viewing of PPT's.  User interface, especially as far as writing and creating documents, virtually impossible to use.",Yes
"I downloaded the free version this app for a kindle fire tablet to be used by my children in a hope that they can practice some writing and editing projects with the tablet in addition to playing games and watching videos. The functionality of this app is fine, while the user interface is quite complicate for young users with limited experience on office software.The big problem of this free version is that it keeps popping up reminders for upgrading to premium version, to the frequency of annoying. It also always want me to sign up for its own cloud account, which I regard as completely unnecessary and potentially risky. Moreover, it comes without font style as basic as Times New Roman. And if you'd like to have this font in option list, you will have to pay for it. Frankly I wouldn't mind to pay for some fancy font, but Times New Roman? Seriously?It's quite obvious to me that this so called ""free"" version put more effort in persuading users to pay than creating a smooth user experience by providing a solid service. I got rid of it in a few days.",Yes
"This wasn't what I wanted and I was expecting word software. I got it but it didn't have the features I thought I would get. I think I should of known that you could get that  software at that price, so I didn't want to be too unfair with my rating, it is good for many applications.",Yes
"In my humble opinion, I would have given it Five Stars if I could navigate it easier. What I have figured out is wonderful. I'm just technologically challenged.",Yes
Thought Fire was an Android device. Not fully.,Yes
Good understanding of MSOffice is very helpful.  Still learning however like it.  Note there is a cost involved,Yes
"All my work documents are down through Microsoft Office, this app allows me to quickly view them for reference.  Does not allow creating or editing without purchase of full app, but does what i need it to.",Yes
"If you're an editor or a content creator, whose indispensable tool-of-the-trade is Track Changes mode in MS Word, the OfficeSuite Free is unworkable - 52 MB of deadweight. I'm a bit bemused by the myopia of whoever is in charge of the rollout of carrots-for-customers at MobiSystems, Inc. Not even a 15-day trial version with Track Changes mode? Or Insert? Or Review? MobiSystems is - ostensibly - targeting OfficeSuite at professionals and semiprofessionnels, who prefer to check out the competence and minutiae of an editing suite before plonking down the money for the full-blown version. This penny-pinching isn't what I expected. Uninstalled without a second thought.",Yes
Very useful.  Well thought out.,Yes
"It ok and work well for what you get. This version is no charge, but I'd suggest buying the Pro Suite for better control. The spreadsheet and document writer works very well on the Pro Suite version.",Yes
The permissions required on your tablet gives the app too much leeway to compromise your data and devicesecurity. Check all the permissions required before you install an app.,Yes
"I thought this would be great at first. It's always helpfulto be able to work on papers on the go. Unfortunetly, this app sucks. Many of the features typical to your average desktop program are missing, uless you upgrade to premium, which costs like, $20. Also, thing screws with the formatting, and everything looks way different when you print it. I have no idea why. Unfortunetly for me, this means I usually have to do my work on the desktop anyway. I'm right back where I started.Lame-ass thing doesn't even have spell-check.",Yes
This is great! For something I thought I would never use on a kindle ... I sure use it all the time. Not quite microsoft office but dang close for what I use it for. Highly recomended.,Yes
Saw where people were saying the program didn't allow you to create documents. I have had no problem creating documents. I haven't tried all the features yet but it seems to do what I need. It's FREE.,Yes
"PAIN in my butt, but I finally had to break down and add this. If you are the average person, it's great, but I'm retired from the office world. I guess I'm not as retired as I thought.",Yes
I bought this for $9.99 and now find most of it is prohibited until I buy the full package. I thought I had.  I also bought an additional app to go with it and was never able to open it.,Yes
I wanted to return this free program because I thought I would be able to use on my laptop and see no way to return or use on my laptop.,Yes
Great little apps with a big file holder love it thx medicine it saved me when I thought that I lost alll my files on my tablet thx again Keep making all your apps,Yes
Thought this was a program for Microsoft windows office. Unfortunately it is not so I removed it from my device.,Yes
I installed the program but decided to delete it after reading the license agreement and the access requirements.  I still want some control of my device.,Yes
It was not as good as I thought it will be.  The computer version is better.,Yes
All my updates are fully disabled. Yet this application just updates anyways. I un-installed it just for safety. Nothing should install or update without the user giving consent. I personally do not recommend this application for risk reasons a loan.,Yes
This app definitely has the potential to aid in many different aspects of the environment I am creating!,Yes
Not really what I thought it was going to be. Didn't help me for what I needed assistance in my application.,Yes
I have been testing the free version for two week s to see if it met my needs. Thought I have found the solution to my wordprocessing needs on Kindle Fire until I received a File Corrupt error or three of my documents. Lost hours and hours of work. Contacted Customer Support twice and have not gotten a response. Will discontinue using and will not buy the Premium version. FRUSTRATED,Yes
I have not used it as of yet.  Looks well thought out.,Yes
"This would be a nice little app IF using a stylus or ""pen"" type. With a finger, it is more challenging to make it look like the photo that comes with the app. It has a nice set of brushes to choose from, but hard to control with the fingers. It also seems to randomly erase areas if you go over a certain part of the screen-I am not sure if it is the program or not. It only allows you to do it in portrait mode, not landscape. (The menu buttons are in portrait mode only-will not rotate if you turn your screen.) Instead of sketching, I just play with the different colors and brushes-it will allow circles, watercolor, spray, thick and thin, fur and so forth to draw with. It has a play button and will ""play"" each step you did. Really fun for children to watch their handiwork reappear again.",Yes
"Sketch Guru is a great app for creating unique pics expressing ur own creativity. U can save ur pictures to ur photos file and then post as u would like.  Since it has so many drawing tools, u can create very different types of art from pencil drawings to neon spraypainted pics. All in all, it's great. Would love to see if a stylus could be used to increase precision on smaller details. Will try that next!",Yes
This seems like it would be a great app.  The controls and selection of tools are great and I was creating some awesome looking sketches.  The problem is this freezes a lot on my Kindle Fire HD.  So I deleted it and will not download again.,Yes
"Great time-killer while waiting at Dr office, etc. Still trying to control the options but I love the creativity it allows.",Yes
"Nice app but with two issues that affect my use of it.First, the app, which lives in portrait mode, does not reorient itself when you rotate the kindle 180 degrees. This is just a case of lazy programming since every other app knows how to do this.  (This is important because some cases situate the camera to the left and others situate it to the right.)Second, on the HDX 7&#34;, the app's control buttons are practically on top of the kindle's home and back buttons, which makes the app unusable by me because  I am unable to tap on the app's buttons.In my rating, the orientation problem cost it a fraction of a star but the inability to access the control buttons was the thing that really brought the rating down. Still, the app shows a lot of promise so I hope the developer addresses these problems.Thank you.",Yes
Amazing! This helped me ALOT with my art work and it even made it better then I thought it would be,Yes
"I'll admit it up front -- I'm a sucker for draw-and-paint programs on mobile devices. There's something deeply satisfying about noodling around on a touch screen, building up an image. You learn early on that you can't expect to make anything as detailed or realistic as you can with physical media, or even a PC-based drawing program hooked up to a drawing tablet. But that's just the nature of the beast. They're built for different purposes.Sketch Guru is the latest offering from Bejoy Mobile, a company that specializes in simple drawing programs for mobile devices. In some ways, this is simpler than most. There are no layers, for instance -- everything is created on a single plane. There is no flood-fill tool. There is only a color palette, a color-sampler tool, and a set of brushes.But what brushes they are! These are not your normal set of smooth-or-fuzzy lines, virtual mimics of physical media such as pencils, marker pens or brushes. They are computational brushes, brushes driven by algorithms that transcend mere imitation. The ""furry"" ones sense the presence of nearby lines, and generate cross-linkages to them. There is a brush that creates a regularly-spaced grid of concentric circles. There is a brush that draws a swath of crosshatching, like loosely-woven cloth. The result is that even simple doodles acquire a subtle complexity, effects usually associated with much more sophisticated media.There are three other features that boost this product from 4-star ""Like it"" to 5-star ""Love it"". The first is the ""Rainbow Color"" option, a feature used in many of Bejoy's products, which cycles the color through the spectrum as you draw. Lifting your finger from the touch-screen changes the color. This is more of a gimmick than a serious tool, but it's a heck of a lot of fun. And, with careful selection of the algorithmic ""brushes"", it can create some stunning effects.The second ""5-star"" feature is the ability to send a drawing directly into another program. I have been pairing Sketch Guru with Autodesk's SketchBook Mobile, a more sophisticated drawing program. There, I can add new layers and work up the raw sketches from Sketch Guru into something more complex. The export doesn't always work properly, but it's worth fussing with it.The third ""5-star"" feature is the price. This is a free app. As in, actually free, not ""freemium"", where you get the basic program free but then need to purchase add-on features. You can't get any better than that!",Yes
I have always been skeptical about tablet drawing apps. But I thought  I would give this one a try an  I'm so glad I did. Excellent app.,Yes
"This drawing app is very simple yet a lot of fun. After choosing a canvas color, you can choose from a variety of brushes and colors to create your own image. Some brushes are more traditional, similar to what you would find in the Microsoft Paint application (such as opaque brushes of various thicknesses and a spray-can-like choice), whereas others are just fun, such as a brush that draws different size squares. Highly recommended.",Yes
"This app is great! I thought that it would be like all the others and have no brush patterns. But I was sooooo wrong. When I finished my first drawing, I was surprised that I had been drawing for about 30 minutes. It doesn't look just like it would with a pencil or paint brush, but it looks pretty good with just a finger. You get amazing designs to give your art a cool effect and texture. It's great for anyone that likes to draw and it's FREE. If you're considering it, I suggest that you get it. SERIOUSLY!",Yes
"Less basic than you would think! Great app for drawing and speed painting... you can blend color surprising well with the brushes offered, and have some control over opacity.. or you can use the delightfully textured chunky brushes available. I LOVE the shadow brush, guys, very nice. You can pan around the canvas and zoom in to work on detail, and you can hide the toolbar. After just a few minutes I felt very comfortable with this program.No layer support and few customizable brushes, but it does what it set out to do. High marks.",Yes
I really like to watch my child interact with this app. She creates many unique peices. This app was very well thought out for many age groups on different creative levels. I'm sure this would even be awesome for adults.,Yes
"This is a fantastic app!!!! it's great for artists, kids, and doodlists. I've Been using this app for so many hours And am sill obsessed with it. The playback action topps it off to Make it perfect! Amazing App!!!",Yes
Awesome color palette and brush stylization. Perfect for relaxing and waxing abstractions. Makes my minds images come alive at my fingertips.,Yes
I am pleased with this app. I am able to draw paint sketch and have fun creating and playing I have a child who draws also I'm excited for her to use this app.,Yes
I personally like traditional art and I suck at digital but with app what I draw actually looks pretty good. I would recommend to anyone! :),Yes
so I was working on a piece that was going to take me a while- I thought that if I saved the image it would save my place in work. so I backed out of the app to come back later. but when I came back it was a blank page. I'm upessti spaghetti. there also are no layers???,Yes
"This is a wonderful drawing app.  It is the best art app I have seen so far... It offers many different tools and effects.  I have more control over the tools in this app, than I have had in other drawing apps.",Yes
"Fairly intuitive to get started with, lots of controls over drawing tools, you can draw with stylus or finger, save work, send work to yourself via email to further manipulate on a computer. I am having fun with it!",Yes
This app has changed the way i look at my art. It helps bring in new perspectives with the option of using a photo as a stencil or free handing it. It is a great way to send hand sketched photos to friends and family. You have many different brush stroke options my recommendation and favorite is ribbon and to fill spaces water color. I spent a very long time searching for a digital sketch app that fits my needs and by far this one won my heart instantly. When i first opened it i was thing to my self this looks childish and mediocre but is actually more advanced than it first looks. Trust me this wont sit there waiting to be deleted you Will constantly use it and create beautiful art. This app is also very high quality your final product looks great and the original photo also looks great. I highly recommended this app for people who want to get the creative juices flowing or a new take on traditional paper and pencil sketching.,Yes
"I really like the app. It's very enjoyable and great for creating cartoonish pictures, but not so much very realistic pics. I find it fun to draw using my fingers with this app, but I wish I could use a stylus or something else to be more accurate with my lines, because nothing else but my fingers will make the lines show up :( (I use my Kindle Fire HD for this app). Also, the app has stopped working on more than one occasion, for no reason. It's not that I run many apps at the same time, because I don't. The most I've ever run at the same time is Silk and Pandora. I hardly have any apps at all, so it's not the memory. Why is it ""not responding""?",Yes
"This is a pretty cool little app, especially considering it's free. Easier to use with a stylus since it gives you better control.",Yes
"Installed on my Kindle Fire HD, it's stable, easy, delivers as promised and free. Like its ""paint"" counterpart, this app is one of the best. Having searched for a drawing program to quickly serve a number of purposes on the run, this app fills every need without going overboard. Controls are direct, simple and effective. The ""animation"" feature is interesting but without real purpose. With the possible exception of maybe some additional features like ""shapes"", most any other criticism would be nit-picking. Bottom line... it's a ""keeper"".",Yes
Found this App to be a fun way to pass time.  I'm creative by nature and doodle constantly so this was a fantastic free find for me.,Yes
Very sweet and intuitive. I'm an instant artist! Ease of use is great too. I took right off creating a masterpiece Thank you very much!!!,Yes
My daughter got these for her kindle. Most of them are free she loves the excitement of getting new apps.,Yes
"It's exactly what a digital sketchbook should be - it's detailed and includes all the best digital art options, while still having the characteristics of traditional sketching (i.e. only one layer). I recommend it to anyone of any age! :)",Yes
"This app is one of the best apps i have ever had! Im 11 and can scetch pretty well, not to brag, but this, this makes me awesome! There are so  many things you can draw with it because the lining is so beautiful! You can draw girls, boys, birds, any sort of animals, nature, ANYTHING!  You should definitely get this app if you love to scetch. It may also be good for adults too and maybe their jobs. For example, interior designer!. DO IT!!!",Yes
I thought this app is very useful for editing and creating new photos. And very fun to play around with,Yes
this game is perfect for everyone. My favorite pictures to draw are nature because of the very cool lines and pencils.,Yes
"I just downloaded this app, and so far it lives up to my expectations. I'm in college for an art related degree, so I'm pretty knowledgeable when it comes to digital painting programs. I was looking for a free painting app that I would be able to create decent quality digital sketches with. I haven't tried out many others, but I was happy to see this one offered a lot of the things I was looking for. Here's a list of pros and cons I've thought of after exploring the app for a few minutes.Pros: Better brush selection than I expected. Some of them seem a bit impractical for serious art, but for something creative and fun, its pretty cool!Ability to adjust brush width and opacity.Effective color selection. I haven't figured out if colors picked may be saved for easy reselection, but if so that would be a super bonus.Ability to undo stepsI haven't explored the eraser tool, but its good that its thereThe video playback is super cool, but I haven't figured out if the videos are able to be saved.I haven't explored what the photo editing feature does, but its cool to know its there.Ability to save. Note: images seem to save only as a PNG file.I didn't spend much time testing it, but it seemed to run pretty smooth with no lagging or choppy lines.If the eyedropper tool works like any other program with an eyedropper tool does, it should be to select colors from your image. I haven't tried it yet, but if that's what it does, bravo to the developers.Cons: Upon first opening the app, it looks like a kids doodling app.The ads are annoying, but to be expected with a free app.No layering features for the serious digital artistsIf there's no way to save the video playback, I think it would be something the developers should add in an update.Another note for the developers. Maybe add an option to save the file as a jpg.This is what I came up with on first impression. So far it seems pretty useful. For the price of free, its great, and I think its worth trying out.",Yes
Did not do what I thought it would do,Yes
"The variety of brush styles is fun to play with. Drawing with my finger was more responsive than I'd expected (this was on a Google 7 tablet). The permissions seem reasonable enough (the network perms would be needed for any app that provides posting to Facebook or displays a stream of ads, as this one does).But those ads -- they're up at the top and fairly out of the way, but they are constantly scrolling and popping a new one up, and it gets REALLY distracting. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad in a fast action game, but when you're drawing, you want calm and a chance to reflect on what to do next -- an opportunity you just don't get with this app.And when you exit, it splashes a full-screen version of one of the ads, just as an extra little unpleasantness.Sad to say, I'll probably uninstall and hope that a less-pushy drawing app comes along.",Yes
I think I have finally found a sketching app that is easy to use and fun to use.  I'm looking for a stylus with a narrower tip.  My fat fingers and my wide stylus prevents me from creating finer images.,Yes
"I thought it was going to look more professional than it was, But it is a good app, I love it!",Yes
I thought the lines and the different ways to use them would be easy but when ever I drew a line of would not be straight or it would glitch,Yes
"It has a lot of different tools and textures to use and be creative with. I've been using it recently to create fan art and stuff, and it works really well! You can zoom in and out and move around the picture. The only problems I have is when I zoom in and out and move about the page, if I get too close to the edge of the picture it bugs out and automatically moves me away from where I wanted to be. Also, it records your actions/strokes, I would like for there to be an option to download the recorded strokes as a video or something. Overall it's a great app for sketching and such! x3",Yes
"OH.MY. first of all round of applause for bejoy mobile staff for in increating highly concentrated awesomeness first, it's FREE and nothing is greater than FREE two, so many options, unlike a regularsketch pad also like this if you like this rough draft: the light,the light all anya could think about, all there was, light light light. She was light. She glowed. Until,suddenly, the delightful feeling was gone,as was the eternal light. Gone? No no no! She tried to search but couldn't turn her head around. She did not seem to remember. Turn! She willed. No, it would not turn. Pure fear radiated from the diminished light. Falling? Another strange sensation? Oh. This feeling was to make her let go. She...was calmed, in a sense. Then a truly happy emotion bubbled up. She could move now that she was calmed. She spread her arms, and they turned into wings. She flew into the pit of darkness. READ THE ANYA HEADED EAGLE TO FIND OUT MORE!!",Yes
"I got this mainly for my son, but I doodle with it too. Great app for the pittance charged for it. Only down side is color selection and control, you have to have a very steady hand if you want lifelike detail.",Yes
This made me look like I can actually draw. My kids and I have had great fun creating masterpieces. Next up is figuring out how to get them printed to celebrate their creations.,Yes
This Strine app is okay. Basically it's a blank piece of paper and some different colored pens you can use. You can't change the color of the paper as well. But it's not exactly what I thought it was going to be from the picture. But for a simple sketching doodling drawing app it works well for that.,Yes
"I really love this app. At first I thought you could just FaceTime people. I don't know you could call, text, and FaceTime. I highly recommend this app.",Yes
This app is great!√∞??¬ç never thought I could call and video chat on a kinde l or none phone device,Yes
"I think that this is just the best video calling app ever! You can play games while you face time, doodle while you face time, and MUCH MORE. I thought it would be boring until I saw the rating. It's almost a 5 star rating. If you are reading this I recommend you get this app. It's AMAZING!!!!",Yes
This app is so cool to use just to talk to you friends never thought it would be so cool √∞???Always be kind to people who are not nice to ya,Yes
I thought this was really good to use of you don't have an iPhone,Yes
I'd give 10 stars but I only have 5! I Love this app!!! It's awesome!!! I give it a thumbs up!!!!! I congratulate you for creating the best app ever!!! √∞??¬ç,Yes
"So ummmm..... It said ""SPIN THE WHEEL FOR PRIZES"" so I did I spin it and it said I won 30 points!! I pressed claim and it said error ecourred please try again so I did and well... It gave me FIVE POINTS well I may have two problems number 2 is the ""magical lotto"" I paid for 1 ticket which ment I should have had 40 points left but the transaction never went through so I was ticketless also I have a question for the just talk person who looks at the comments we hope u do Jimmy anyway how do I enter the lotto thingy?",Yes
"This app did not do what I thought it would. I was trying to use it on a tablet that doesn't have a phone number associated with it. I thought it might work over my wireless connection at home. I doesn't. Not the apps fault, I just couldn't tell without trying it.",Yes
Kids are able to download this. This is a parental control concern.,Yes
I DID NOT order this! Perhaps you should look into bettersecurity measures.,Yes
"Like most other apps, they want to invade your privacy andsecurity by demanding too many permissions with your phone.  Personally, I refuse to allow that. So I won't download any apps which want to invade my phone and steal information from it.",Yes
I like the privacy andsecurity,Yes
"Does not work when parental controls are active.When I try to make a video call while parental controls are active, the screen locks into a very annoying flicker and I find it impossible to terminate the call.  I can not see the person on the other end of the call.  I would give the app a much higher rating if it would produce an informative error message about not working with parental controls on instead of locking the screen.With parental controls turned off the app works as expected.",Yes
Highly recommend this type of social interaction.,Yes
It's really awesome.I thought AT first it would suck because of the other reviews but don't listen to the other reviews.,Yes
It likely to occur a error like that: when I log in my account on skype( use kindle fire hd 7). If i log out then I can not log in again. I thought may be i forgot my password. But I have tried to recover my password and then try log in. But it still doesn't work!,Yes
It works well. Just make sure that access to camera is enabled under parental controls on the Fire Tablet.,Yes
"This app is a really fun way to stay in contact w/ ur friends. I love skyping  texting my friends, but there are a few issues..... First of all, its freezes up a lot.... Second of all, u have no control over the volume... Lastly, when ur skyping a friend, sometimes it glitches and u can't see ur face or ur friends face or u can't hear them..... But there are a few things u should add, like more emojis, and maybe if ur skyping more than one friend, u can make so u can see there faces instead of just hearing there voices... That's all... I love this app...√∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???",Yes
"Microsoft. ""You don't have any coins to make that call"". I remember when it was free and not controlled by the behemoth.",Yes
easier to use than I thought,Yes
"Could never actually use it .it says I have one but all the""security "" makes it so hard to get through all the hoops ..",Yes
"Sorry, I just hate Skype! My husband thought it would be great for his business trips, and I refuse to use it. I seem to keep hitting the wrong thing and getting lost. Suddenly tons of icons come up that mean nothing to me. Just need SIMPLE messaging, and this does not seem to be it. Booo!",Yes
"works well but does not keep my status. I.E. if I want to be ""Do not Disturb"" it wont remember from one logon to the next... every time I open my mail it makes me ""Available"" on skype.",Yes
I liked the clarity of the images and ease of connection. Understanding the icons was not easy for me.,Yes
"I was unable several times to download  Skype Software s.a.r.l., until finally successful-no idea what the reason for this was.My device froze completely when on my first call with Skype Software s.a.r.l. -the device was only one day old and so had to be returned to the supplier.Sound test had worked OK so I had thought all would be fine.",Yes
I have a kindle fire and there is not an app for this yet. I thought I would be able to use this feature on my Kindle Fire.,Yes
Super communication and interaction app,Yes
How can anybody not like Skype? - We've used it for years to text and do video calls for free to family and friends who live abroad. Our parents in particular are so happy to see us frequently on Skype. We use Skype all the time when travelling too as was the case in our receipts adventure trip to Peru. Skype worked for us on any device we tried and as long as you have WiFi you are good to go.,Yes
SKYPE has come a long way. Hopefully it will keep improving in speed and quality. Ease of use should be like WHT APP. Keepsecurity strong. Reduce prices. Pricing complicated.,Yes
"I thought Skype for Kindle HD Fire would be good, but I was sadly mistaken. Only after I installed it did I realise there was no video!I then uninstalled it. Pity.",Yes
I've used it before but it had been a long time and needed it back on computer/phone/kindle. It's not as easy to use as I thought. WhatsApp actually went faster. But will be using it to make Skype calls when I can!,Yes
I am very unhappy with the events surrounding the purchase of the Kindle. I bought the Kindle specifically for my daughter to read books and Skype while she was on her five month trip. We promptly got our purchase but were unable to open the download of the Skype app. We phoned for technical support and the agent went through the download process with us. It did not work. The agent was aware that I had read a number of product reviews that the new Kindle Fire was capable of Skype. They thought there might be a licensing issue and that they would make my concern known and that someone would contact me with an answer on way or another with in a week or so.. That was December 19th and no one ever did. I could have returned the Kindle and gotten another tablet if I had known. I think that Kindle/Amazon should be dealing with this discrepency and communicating what the issues are rather than avoiding a customer. I am a new Amzon user (first purchase was a Kinndle) and I don't feel that the customer service reflects the amount of emails I am receiving promoting specials etc. Maybe the company should focus on keeping customers by responding to issues.,Yes
This program now has  Back doors which allow black hat hackers to get into your computer on the front end allowing them to control your computer without root. If left  On they can easily gain root access and steal your identity or Worse. When this operation  Started before Microsoft bought it this was a peer to peer application where no middle man can just access video and audio that is absolutely private. Now that Microsoft owns it they run it through their servers and keep your video and audio in possible perpetuity. I suggest anyone who has this program to audit it if you have the ability or just not use it. There are better applications out there that don't compromise your privacy.,Yes
"Best to communicate where abouts, when disability prevents verbal interaction.",Yes
"I thought this would work on a regular kindle, but it does not. You have to have a Kindle HD to use it. Oh well.",Yes
Was hard to set up account  and you have to deactivate  your parental controls on your device to use.,Yes
"I thought I could outsmart the plethora of negative reviews, especially since Skype is a well known platform.  I failed, I was able to log in but that was it. The app immediately crashed to a black screen and never returned.",Yes
I thought it was great,Yes
"Passwords never work, a person ends up creating too many accounts under different names and linked to other accounts with no easy way to delete them. Downloaded SKYPE to chat with my son who is deployed overseas and only sent one invite for him to connect. He accepted and cannot find ""which"" account he got my invitation from. So far we've done better with facebook chat/facetime.",Yes
"It will not turn-on the speaker or headset. There is no control over it, and Android or skype help is helpless.The skype voice test feature did not work and the test listed no data errors. An application delete and reinstall resulted in the application  not longer recognizing my account. I deleted it.",Yes
My mother was given this kindle as a gift to view and talk to her daughter whose permanently hospitalized 2000 miles away - Skype is the only application that she uses on the kindle - she is 87 yrs old and was thrilled to be able to see and talk to her daughter over the last 5 months - last week she got on Skype and found that your latest updated version3.2.505.13 has shrunk the viewable image to half the size of the screen where before she had a much larger picture - the solution simple - buy a different tablet from another manufacturer which gives you the option of choosing which version of Skype works best for you - she is very upset and now wants a tablet that gave her the image size she once had before,Yes
The app works well but has no volume control. Is very difficult to hear contacts when conducting video or voice chat.,Yes
Not worth the download.  Thought it would be easier.  Not many options.,Yes
I'm surprised to see a lot of negative comments about the updated Skype. I thought I am the only one having trouble with it. I had been trying to login with my credentials and Skype simply keeps on promptinh me with &#34;Unable to sign in.&#34; How horrible it is! I don't know how to fix it. :(,Yes
We tried 5 or 6 times on Xmas eve.  My daughters first Xmas in California!  Then it wanted to charge us.... I thought Skype was free..... So dissapointed,Yes
"When purchasing a Kindle, be sure you list all that you want to use it for....eg I want to be able to take pictures and use Skype.  I had heard a lot about the Kindle Fire and decided to update my existing one.  I purchased mine at the shop in the airport, after having passed through the Customs.......only to find when I opened the packaging that there was no camera facility - hence not able to use Skype.  The shop assistant who sold it to me made no mention of it not having a camera, so it has been an expensive mistake on my part.Having said that, the Kindle Fire is easy to handle, small enough to fit into my handbag - it tends to be slightly heavy so  I do need to make sure i don't carry too many others things in it.  Downloading books is extremely simple and almost immediate!  Using the internet is simple, getting Apps takes time.  I do think the instruction booklet could be more comprehensive though, it's very brief.  I had to resort to the Amazon help section on it, to find out how to do some things.  Once I had mastered how to do these things, it's a delight to have.",Yes
"A complete let down. My cell phone just broke so I thought I would get a skype number and a subscriotion and just use my tablet as my phone for a while.  Hasn't imported all of my contacts from my phone, particularly the newest ones from the last month which is most frustrating because ose are my co workers. Also, when someone calls me there is no ringing, no notification at all. When I open the app it just says missed call. And finally, the app will not let me send text messages. It says - you don't have Skype credit, buy credit or a subscription.  I HAVE A SUBSCRIPTION!!!!",Yes
Need better understanding of voice.,Yes
Skype app works well for what it  has to do.  However I have an issue with sound.  Ihave all sound set to max in system control and fire sound control button.  Can hardly hear those on other end.  I get no sound at all when using earphones.  I have Amazon 7th gen fire HD.  Sound Works Well On All My other apps.,Yes
"Skype has been steadily going down the hill ever since Microsoft bought it, but this last update is the final straw for me - the app became totally unusable now! Not seeing who is online, not able to set my own status (no matter how many times i try to change my status to active, it always switches back to ""invisible"" on its own, so my contacts do not see me online either), contacts list is a trash dump, no way to organize contacts into groups - the list is endless! Microsoft is a chicken with its head cut off and everything that they touch turns into manure. Installed Viber and will start migrating over to that service.",Yes
"I have been trying to use this app on my Kindle Fire for several months now and I can accurately sum up my experience with it like this....I video chat for a minute, Skype starts making dinging sounds, and then it crashes.  I restart this app, video chat for a minute, Skype starts making dinging sounds, and then it crashes.  I restart this app, video chat for a minute, Skype starts making dinging sounds, and then it crashes.

I restart this app, video chat for a minute, Skype starts making dinging sounds, and then it crashes........Apparently Skype for Kindle suffers from severe stability issues and is completely unusable.  Even for a free app I feel like I got ripped off because SKYPE IS THE MAIN REASON I AND A MILLION OTHER USERS BOUGHT A KINDLE!  FIX THIS PATHETIC MESS!",Yes
"The worst aspect of this app is that it continually fails to push messages from people. Often I will message someone only to suddenly have several messages sent to me hours before suddenly load. To the other people, it just appears I am ignoring them. Signing on to the desktop app at the same time will make the messages show up and be received immediately, but then what is the point of using the app if I have to use the desktop?The interface was already bad and they continue to make it worse with each update. Now contacts are separated into a long alphabetical directory rather than simply allowing you to see who is online at a glance. The desktop interface is fine, and I'm not sure why they feel the need to try and deviate from it.You cannot choose any status but online or invisible. Worse, you can't see if anyone else has their status set as away or busy. You simply see them as online, when in reality they may not want to be disturbed.The desktop program is fine. The mobile app however is handicapped in several ways. If you need a way to use Skype from your phone or tablet, this is unfortunately your best option. If you are just looking for a video/instant messaging app that doesn't need to be Skype, then choose something else.",Yes
"At first this app was amazing! But then bad stuff starting happening, first, my messages weren't sending for a while. Then when they started sending, the app said I can update it. I was so excited to see what new stuff they did with Skype! Until after I updated it, when I tried logging in again, it said they didn't recognise my email\phone number\name! I tried more than once and it never worked. When I first got this app I thought it was amazingly designed, but now I feel like its the worst messaging app ever. I'm deleting this app right away.",Yes
"I believe that I've used Skype for at least the last 10-12 years, and I have to admit I thought it was a much better program before being purchased by Microsoft. The program used to work flawlessly, no dropped calls, no problems hearing one side or the other, etc. I can't rate Skype for computer to computer calling. For calling computer to landline from overseas, my calls are are almost routinely dropped or there's a clicking noise on the line; and usually one side or the other can't make out parts of the conversation. Unfortunately I haven't found another vendor who provides a comparable service that's any more reliable.",Yes
"This will be my third Skype account.  So far none of them work properly.  My first attempt with Skype was about five years ago and it worked perfectly.  Since then, it is constantly degraded to the point where I get garbled sound and no video.  I thought by having it on my Kindle.  My problem would be resolved.  No such luck.  I think Skype just does not like me.  I know it is not my Internet connection because the next step up would be to full commercial satellite receiving.  It does work okay for instant message, though, but that's not why I bought it.  Yes, I even purchased an upgrade version for my computer and it still does not work.  Skype and me just don't agree.  I sure hope someone from Skype reads this review and offers me some help because their customer service is probably the worst in the industry",Yes
"This was a terrific program and my chat of choice.  It had very intuitive chat, great voice chat and decent video chat.  Now it got a facelift in this last update and now you can't hit enter to send messages...it's now a button up in the chat area that the keyboard covers up.  You used to be able to change your status from online to away or invisible or offline....now you can't.  You're online as long it's running and have to completely shut down the kindle to turn it off.  Before this update I rated this at about a 5*....now that's no longer friendly to use at all it's down to 2*....and that's being generous.  Looks like this is now a PC only program again for its useability because that platform hasn't gotten the horrible facelift.  So much for talking to friends elsewhere in the house!",Yes
"After I downloaded this app on my Amazon Tablet,I really enjoyed it. The app was way better than what I thought. I'm not really an internet addict,but Skype is addicting. My only suggestion for the creators of Amazon is to make an upgrade for the Amazon Tablet that allows you to join group calls on Skype. Other than that,nice work.√∞???√∞???",Yes
"My Kindle Fire HD 8.9 came preloaded with Skype which worked fine. Took awhile to figure it all out, but then it was fine. When I sign in with the Skype ID I use on my PC, and it worked fine. In fact, I really liked the camera function because it was better than the Kindle one.  Both the video & camera had nice zoom and brightness controls. BUT now with the new update, I don't even see the ""take a picture"" option any more and the video messaging doesn't have all those controls any more.  On the UPSIDE, the video when you are chatting with someone is a lot clearer and sharper.  Hope they add back the camera function.",Yes
"The ""update"" rendered Skype unusable for kindle.Its impossible to change your status from invisible, so your friends cant FIND you to add you.Searching for friends by Skype name OR email results in that friend not found, even if you are on the phone via voice and message exchanging that data.I gave up and took Skype off my kindle. It was a working program until they ""improved"" it.Don't bother. Pick a different messaging system.",Yes
"With the new version of skype it is not possible to see who is online(the yellow or green status) or who has accepted your contact request(the question mark sign) . I wish this features be added to a new relese to make skype, the great messenger app it has been.",Yes
Every time I try to video chat on my kindle it doesn't work. It always freezes and it exits me out or you can't hear me. I fixed everything that was wrong with my kindle or thought that was. And that wasn't the problem. Please fix it so I don't have trouble in the future.,Yes
"It's been well over a year since I've been able to send photos via Skype on the kindle fire. Both of my nieces have kindle fires and they have the same issue. I can send them photos from other devices (traditional computers, iPad, iPhone, and my Microsoft Surface) and they can receive those photos. But one cannot send jpegs via Skype for Kindle. This update did not address that issue.",Yes
"The main issue I have with Skype is the fact that it crashes constantly. I could be video chatting with someone or simply rotating my kindle before Skype decides it's too much for it to handle that it will crash. After the update, I also noticed I wasn't able to hear the person I called, even after raising the volume all the way up. Took me a while to realize that you can raise the volume specifically for Skype calls that you can ONLY access just as you are calling the person before they answer (you do this by pressing the volume control on the side of the tablet).PLEASE FIX THIS. It is very annoying and highly inconvenient.",Yes
"I was having trouble with skype, so I called their customer service number and long story short, the tech man was somehow able to remote control the computer I was trying to use skype on. He controlled my mouse and was able to click on my settings. When I told him to stop, he threatened me. It was a nightmarish experience and I will never have anything to do with Skype ever again.",Yes
"For the most part, Skype works well on my Kindle Fire HD. Have tested it out in different locations and I've conceded at this point that my dropped calls at home are due to my questionable internet service provider. HOWEVER -- Skype ALWAYS crashes if I'm signed-in to Skype and (like most people) put the Kindle in sleep mode when not in use with it password enabled. When I receive a call and need to unlock my Kindle, Skype crashes and I receive an error message that simply reads ""Skype has stopped."" I wouldn't even be writing this review if it didn't happen EVERY SINGLE TIME.Another small complaint is that it takes far too long to sign in. I'm waiting in excess of 30 seconds during the sign-in process. It takes a fraction of that time on the mobile version and the PC version. It is in my personal opinion that the Kindle version needs MUCH improvement.I'd be interested to know if any others are experiencing the crashing problem or if it's just me.",Yes
I can not for the life of me get this app to work. I thought it was my tablet so I tried my husband's and it crashed on. His constantly and froze the device. Please fix this so I can talk to my family again. I really liked to be able to video call them. I can't anymore :/,Yes
"Every update make it more unstable, lit off black screen starting the video call, than not responding. Volume control only after conversation start, before that you can only adjust an other volume, look s like the warnings. This is the only app what adjust something else what they should. No Mic sensitivity setup, on phone no camera or selection. They made a good app to pain to use, so you look for an alternative. If Google hangout stars to work on kindle, this one is gone.One star because the last version was broken too, but at least that was worked.",Yes
"Its pretty good at first. Until i noticed i never got updates on my conversations, i thought no one was talking but instead the app would not alert me about messages, or show them, it stopped showing messages all together. Making me miss important  information details, an  conversation  all together. I was unaware of its doing until i opened up SKYPE on the computer 115 missed messages. For some this is the only way to contact me so i deem this unacceptable for an app to do. Extremely dissatisfied",Yes
"I cannot write how unbelievably awful the new update is but let's try shall we. It CONSTANTLY crashes not only the app its self but my whole freaking kindle! You can no longer control the volume when you have it on in the background, you could have it on nothing and still have the call blaring on full blast! When it has crashed and you restart the app it can still call, although for a video calling service you often end up with no video at all! Just freaking perfect and the best part is, there is no going back, you can no longer get an actual fully functional version of Skype. At the moment, you are better off with Oovoo!!",Yes
"Have used this app before with limited success on an Android phone. Got it again pre-installed on my Kindle but due to usage issues I don't go on often enough to remember my password. I attempted creating a new account as it would not send a ""forgot password"" email and the app refused to cooperate. No matter what or how many characters I used for a password it insisted it was always too short, it managed to change my user name to something completely off the wall (which was not a result of any text autocorrect), and sadly, was just an overall useless app at a moment when it was a personally important  to have. I will be researching other video chat/text apps that I'm certain will be less headache to use.",Yes
Well I would have thought that they would have fixed Skype by now. Mine crashed and burned big time. I uninstalled and I reinstalled. I guess I'll have to see what happens but I'm not too confident considering all the reviews.,Yes
First of all it asked me for my Microsoft account whose password I don't remember second of all when I filled out the forgot password thing and instead of sending a password  reset it asks to make asecurity code and when I fill that out every time I make a code it says sorry code didn't work try again I try again and again but it just doesn't work.,Yes
"I love this app, it's the most amassing app for calls and video calls! You can get your friends and family to call you and see them if you chose. I've used this app alot ,althought it may only work on Kinde Fire HD ,its great for talking and even if I don't know, your deaf you can see each other to do sign language. And there's also a chat so you can talk to them by reading and typing. But even better, you can create group calls a chat to all of the people on that call! There is a certain area  where you can buy ""skype credits"" to call someone's phone but everything else should be free!",Yes
"COMPLETE GARBAGE! I had to uninstall it on my Kindle Fire HD 8 because the option for ""keep me signed in"" wasn't there even though the Skype chat agent says it's supposed to be on every platform and also because no form of sound or vibrate notifications were coming through for an incoming call. When I tried to reinstall it, it opened the first time as if it's going to successfully reinstall, but when it had downloaded and in the installing step, it stopped at around 90% and wouldn't go further. I thought it was because of a bad Wi-Fi signal, so I out it on the router directly and still didn't work. Cancelled the install attempt and tried to search for Skype again to download and experienced the whole it trying to open but closes after half a second.",Yes
I want too understand exactly how soft the softest isas apposed  too the areas of hardness that meet oistness in unison and cum togethor too allow rythmic understanding and extreme friction that cant be denied be the rythmic unision.That blows out each like a gyser.,Yes
"Trying to find info on SKYPE for Kindle Fire HD6, for my Mom.Where is the 'HOW TO' manual so I can assist her.I'm in Australia, she's in Texas!In short, need to know where video screen control buttons are for minimising/maximising caller, messaging and turning off/on from her HD6.She only gets minimised screen of caller after accidentally touching something.Thanks",Yes
The last update its unbelievable bad and completely incompatible with Kindle Fire HD 8'9. You just hear nothing and cannot control the volume. Plus the application crash constantly. Avoid this update.,Yes
"I used to like Skype. A lot. But after it got updated, I HATE IT. Now I can't multitask as much anymore (as in talking on Skype and doing something else). Sometimes when I'm talking with someone on Skype and I go off the app to another one, it stops and disconnects my call. Yes, the appearance looks better, but technological wise, it sucks. Please get the bugs fix :/ I hate it. The camera on Skype is disoriented for my Kindle Fire. I thought maybe it was my device or internet connection, but I tried restarting it and everything, but the condition still is the same. It's bad for me that's why I'm leaving a review for those of you who haven't updated Skype yet to NOT UPDATE IT. Hopefully it gets better so I can change the star ratings :/",Yes
"It crashes for no reason, doesn't stay connected.  Text messages are not always delivered or only part is.  Status messages don't display reliably.  Other than that it's great.",Yes
"I can text my friends (who I never get to see) and I can video call them too. I thought skype was only for computers but it turns out, it's on the Appstore. Get it it's free and works on kindle fire hd!",Yes
"I do not use this program anymore because there is a problem with the Volume control -- I contacted customer service about this and they worked me through this, but with every new update -- the problem comes back -- low volume and no way to adjust this on the Kindle Fire!",Yes
Soo everything was working fine then after like 15 min. Of using it my camera stopped working. I thought it was the app so I un installed it but my camera on my kindle nor vine is letting me use my camera. It wad before I downloaded this. HELP,Yes
"Please, for the love of the powers that be, do something about the compatibility issues with the kindle fire, any messages I send, no matter who they're to, or if they're online/offline the message will be in ""pending"" status for anywhere from an hour to several days, and logging in/out - rebooting my kindle doesn't work two stars for these reasons, other wise, would be five, long time Skype user",Yes
It does not work for very  good.  It stops working right in the middle of talking with some one.  It needs to get better.  I like my kindle hd.  I thought it was going to do as well as theI pad,Yes
"I never thought I would admit it, but now that I have one and have played with it for a bit; yah! Another wonderful and fun toy. Thanks, best little all purpose pad out there!",Yes
This app is a really good app there's nothing wrong with this app you have control on your volume etc. If you get this app you will be very happy I promise this app will not let you down. I use skype all the time I like using it it's so much fun.,Yes
Skype was great until the update on the kindle.. now I can't control the volume.I have no of talking my friends walking to the bus!! :(,Yes
Freaking lag all the time and it cut off my video calls and I can't seem to call them back. So i have to shut it down and reopen but just to find out that it freaking bug again. I thought you guys were supposed to be the official trustworthy brand or something. You guys let me down.,Yes
"I thought it was me being useless but have read the reviews 're the new Skype and,thankfully it's not. I can't sync contacts, or even use the new Skype on my kindle fire,although it's useable on my phone.",Yes
I doesn't let me get through the first step of creating an account,Yes
"Skype's ringer volume is to low to hear, even when you are connected to a blue tooth speaker.  And the voice volume controls have very little effect. Do not buy a fire phone if you intend to use Skype.",Yes
The new update for skype made skype just break. The screen for it is just black I thought reinstalling would help but nope! Skype will not even download again. It just is going to be a file In my cloud in til this is fixed.,Yes
"some of my contacts have a white mystery mark on there status so I cant tell if there busy or not, not much a big deal but what does it meen?",Yes
"Volume from the external speakers is far to low to be useful, and doesn't seem to be under the control of the kindle fire HD I hold in my hands.Very depressing, as I bought this device for my 80 grandmother in-law, with the idea they could get away from the older PC, and Skype anywhere in the house.Solved the issue by ""side loading"" Skype 3.2 from the Skype website. (Google search should show you how to do both.)This almost ended up in us returning this device for an iPad, which in my experience, works as advertised to right out of the box.If anyone asks me in the future, should I get an iPad or a kindle, thus experience will be part of what I tell them.",Yes
The Skype app for Kindle Fire is awfully. No  volume control and always crashing.,Yes
"When I got this app I thought what a better way to talk to my friends, but this app is free to the download but you have to pay for credits to call or video chat. This app is a dumb app that is not free. I DON'T recommend this app at all.",Yes
"Skype is even better on Kindle then I thought, so keep up the good work, just keep up the good work.",Yes
Skype came installed on my new Kindle Fire HD and it absolutely sucks. It freezes constantly and then causes the Kindle to restart. The volume is ridiculously low and there isn't a volume control for Skype specifically. I'd say this is completely unusable on the Kindle.  I'd give zero stars if I could.,Yes
"Jeez Louise. I thought this chiz was gonna be the breakthrough for me being a cool kid. But it turns out that I have no friends and Skype won't give me any. Then it got bad. I would pretend I had friends. But then I gained 500 pounds and started getting followed by local stray cats. Skype is ruining my life. Run, Carl, run as fast as you can before the people of Skype software S.a.r.I come after you and a much more unfortunate series of events haunts you.",Yes
"good and fast connect ,but during voice call sometime there is voice distraction,and video is getting hanged.There is no friend search option and  video chat and Message simultaneous cannot be posible",Yes
The app has everything I really need but it lacks stability. The app crashes roughly five to six times a day. I wish it wouldn't crash so much if it didn't I would've  given it maybe q 5 star rating. I do hope that sometime soon you create group calls an  not misanthropy chats.,Yes
"I love Skype on my pc and phone but am extremely disappointed to learn that it doesn't work properly on the Kindle Fire HD. We just set it up so that my son can chat with my mom but the volume is far too faint to hear a word. There are no volume controls in the app itself, so the only control is from the device. I have the volume up all the way but still can't hear a thing.I read some of the more recent comments and reviews and it seems that everyone is having the same issue.Didn't anyone test this before the release?",Yes
This new kindle hd I recently bought is really nice! And this Skype app keeps me in thought with my immediate family in Florida all the way from NY! Thanks guys awesome job!!! :),Yes
"I'm giving this 5 stars because I can now video chat with my daughter. with missing her so much, it's nice to sit and chat. I get to see her facial reactions to my stories. AND ITS FREE. great to keep up with friends and loved ones.not a hard app to use, either.",Yes
"Whoever made this App gets a double thumbs up. Ive tried rather hard and you cant get any feed back from it, even full blast music wont get you feed back on the Kindle Fire HD. Rather easy to use, and has some good settings options that i not sure that exists in the pc version even thought it should. That bwing said, it doesnt have an its own volume control, so dont expect to watch or listen to anything while chatting with a friend.",Yes
"I have had a 32GB 8.9 HD kindle since it first came out in late 2012 & some earlier models. If you read through many of the reviews you should notice that most of the 5 star ones were written shortly after the release of the HD series in late 2012 & early 2013. On the other hand, the poor 1 & 2 star reviews were written since late 2013 & later.I would agree with this as it matches my own experience. The original Skype for the Kindle Fire HD series worked very well but an update issued sometime late last year changed all of this. There appears to be two main issues:1. SOUND VOLUME:Even if your volume is set all of the way up before launching Skype, conversations are barely audible. This may be because MS/Skype expect you to use ear buds which is a common way to use the app. If you in fact do this then you will find the audio level to be okay. HOWEVER, if you don't use ear buds then check the volume setting within Skype using the hardware volume switch and you will probably notice that the volume is way down around 25%. If you raise the volume to 100% using the hardware volume control then conversations can be heard okay just like the earlier version and it stays this way in subsequent sessions. They may have made the initial setting this way to prevent ear bud users from blowing out their ears.2. CRASHES:I don't know what to say about this except to confirm that I have had the same experience. Skype starts okay but invariably crashes (frozen screen, no sound, etc.) within 5 minutes and will then the Kindle will spontaneously reboot. This makes what is otherwise an excellent app next to useless.So, this problem has been around for over 6 months without being fixed. Amazon gets a failing grade from me on this issue as they should at least make the original version available for download from their app store for folks having this problem while they are sorting out the issues with the latest version.",Yes
"The audio was horrible with the speakers or the headset.  The video was alright.  Controls, settings are minimal.  2 weeks after I started using skype on kindle fire hd, I had six unauthorized charges on my credit card from skype.  I have used skype on several computers for years, but never purchased anything.  The only way to connect my skype account with my credit card was amazon prime/kindle.  That's pretty sad.  Skype  is removed from my account.",Yes
Thought this was a free app so my granddaughter could text me without her mom buying her a phone and realized it really isn√¢??t a free texting app.  Was looking for a free texting app for her kindle fire,Yes
"It works-ish.  You can call and text, but you have to watch TONS of ads.  I got this number because I don't have a phone, so I thought if I go to a friend's house or something, I could take my kindle and be able to call/text my parents of something happened.  WRONG.  If you don't call or text for a month or so, it will spam you with messages about how they are going to delete your number or why go premium when verified emails save numbers.  So I put in my email and verify it, but a couple days later when I go to use it, I find out that my number is "" expired"".  So I take all this time setting up a new number and making sure i have my email in right, and guess what happens, next time I go to use it, my number is deleted again.  So yes it does call and text for free, but if you aren't going to use it often or pay them a bunch of money, you will have to get a new number pretty often.  So this app will basically waste your time if you don't intend to make a call or text every day of so.",Yes
This is perfect because when I first got my kindle I was very mad because i thought I could text my friend but I couldn't.Then I found this app and we text each other all the time.√∞???,Yes
"I got this app for my daughters kindle so that she could message her dad, her cousin, and me. Some random person texted my child! And I could not access the messages from the TextMe website.I wish that only people her in contacts can contact her but not sure that's possible. I don't feel this app is safe for children.I also feel that the app isn't user friendly. There are some issues with functionality and ease in adding/naming/deleting contacts.UPDATED March 2017: while our account was still active, TextMe issued OUR phone number to another person (I'm assuming a child). My husband and I have iPhones. When our daughter first received her TextMe number we input them into our Contacts and texted her several times over the course of a few months.Well this morning my husband texted our daughter to get up and get dressed but someone else responded: ""I don't know you! You're not my dad!"" At first my husband thought our daughter was joking around. It led to a series of texts. Our daughter denied getting or sending any texts. She showed us her app, we tried texting her, and nothing showed up. Instead someone else replied.I apologized to the other person and told them to notify their parents about this. His or her last text to me was them telling me that they were SCARED and to stop texting them.They should be scared! This is BAD! I immediately deleted my daughter's profile (which was still active) and uninstalled the app. This is not safe.",Yes
You had to give it info I was not wishing to give and I felt it would be asecurity risk to run this app.,Yes
Thought it would have been a wifi call,Yes
In my opinion this app deserves five stars but they could add something to make the app look cooler to attract more customers√∞??¬Å I did have second thoughts about if I should get it but I decided I would try it out and I have been highly impressed I really recommend this app for you well I wish you all  the best bye√∞???,Yes
Didn't work as my children thought it would.,Yes
This app worked great for a year. Then I missed messages. No one could receive my messages. Now most cell carriers do not even see the numbers they give you as a real number. There is no way to complain or a forum to find answers. I lived in Kentucky when I got the app and got a New Jersey number. It offers free credits for watching ads. You do not get the credits most of the time. It caused problems between my wife to be and myself. She thought I was ignoring her. So if you use this app know that it rarely if ever works and don't try to communicate with the ones you love because it will end badly....  Thank you TextMe for putting a gap between me and the one I love. I would very much like to meet the developers of this app to show them exactly how much pain they caused me.,Yes
Soooooo Soooooo good I thought this might be a scam but it's not I definitely recommend this app,Yes
It says unable to connect to the internet when creating a account. Don't waste your time.,Yes
Well fi r me it didn't really work out like it said it would and I'm new to texting and i thought this would be perfect but I guess not but if your good at upload ing every two minutes to a head.,Yes
This is a great app to use if you don't have a cell phone. It takes wifi witch is a little annoying when you leave UR house and can't chat with friends. You can set a signature witch is pretty cool. The only problem I have had with the app so far is that my device didn't have a microphone or a camera so the calling and video message features do not work. I have also received a message from another text me user that I DoD not know but this is not a reoccurring event so I am not to worried about it. This is a great app with tones of great features!!!,Yes
Not what I thought.,Yes
"I am dissapointed, I thought I could use my phone, but I got another number.",Yes
GREAT IT WORKS just fine for kindle fire ive used this app for a long time. I wish u cloud face time iphones thought,Yes
I have this on my kindle and it works well.  It meets needs to text and it has a calling function too but I have not used that feature. The only improvement I would suggest is to allow users to create their own address book rather than creating from contacts via email and social media.,Yes
This did not work the way I thought it would it was very difficult for me to try and figure out.,Yes
Not to happy with the app. The sound quality is horrible and the ads on the actual message screen are a nightmare. I have this installed for my older kids so I just wish it was a bit easier and simpler. The ads influenced my 3 star rating otherwise I would have gave the app 4. Needs improvement!,Yes
"The app worked better than I thought! When I opened the app it asked me to sign up, it asked various of question including your email ( just for verification ). Then I got credits ( what you use to call ) first few were free, but you can get more free credits by watching videos or offers and or you can buy credits. If your using it on your kindle ( I am ) you don't need credits cause I don't have a microphone to speak to people, but you can still call, it actually works to call other people on a number, but it will drop if you don't have a microphone on said device. It actually gives you a number!!",Yes
"Because you use a different phone number, my contacts thought I had gotten a different phone and started texting me from their phones which had picked up my Kindle number. What a mess!! Just a marketing ploy, wont be texting from Kindle again!",Yes
"Yea I never was able to ""register"". I grabbed the app yesterday and as of today the status is still at the ""register"" stage.....yes a day later. I wish I could say more positive things about the app, but as of right now.....its not looking to good for pinger and my satisfaction.",Yes
"Textme works beautifully on my Kindle Fire.  Works perfectly with the onboard keypad.  Notifications should, perhaps, be independent of volume setting.  I miss a few since I listen to soft music.  Nice replacement for textplus which seemed to get phased out.",Yes
Love this app it controls email texting and calling,Yes
I really think this is a great app. The only thing I found wrong was you need internet and you can't make calls without credits. Otherwise I thought it was a great app.,Yes
"I previously used Text Plus, but it never notified me of texts. This app does.  I don't have a cell phone, so this works great :)  Very easy to use.  And for those of us with vision impairments, you can set font size to large.  My only complaint is it would be nice to make font even larger than maximum size now, because my vision is that bad :)Otherwise, it's great.  And you can reply to a text while in another app!!!Update:  With the update issued on July 4, 2017 - It took a bit to get the update to actually install.  Then the program simply wouldn't launch.  However, I think technology is against me today :)  So I uninstalled it, and reinstalled it.  And then was able to get into the app.  I must say, the large font is now larger :)  So THANK YOU TextMe developers :)  And I love the new design/interface.  The telephone numbers I text, or the names, are easier to see, as well.  So from this visually challenged person?  A HUGE thank you!!!!  Awesome update!",Yes
"This is an awesome app, except it said free calls. I have to buy credits to call people when I thought this would give me free calls. Anything otherwise is Awesome!",Yes
Not what I thought out was gong to be = deleted it,Yes
"My phone recently broke and I can't afford a replacement. This app works excellent on my Kindle Fire. Here's the funny thing- everyone said it sounds better than my old phone! I've only had a few calls with bad reception out of several. I tried it on my older Kindle and the sound quality is not good. Be prepared for a lot of ads that show up as a small area above your text box, not a pop-up invasion! but you can pay $5. a month to remove them. It does calls, texts and video chat. The texts allow you to send and receive photos, links and videos. The only awkward thing I found is when you send a pic it gives the person receiving it a link to your Amazon photos instead of showing the photo in the text. You earn credits for doing actions like watching videos but I'm still trying to figure out what you need them for because I have yet to use any of them. I'm sure eventually I'll figure it out. I've been using it for about a week and a half and am very satisfied.",Yes
"I thought I would be able to use my current phone #, not be issued a new # for texting.",Yes
It didn't see it say anywhere that you have to buy credits to use the texting feature. I thought as long as there was wifi you could text for free..guess not.,Yes
Thought it was free,Yes
"At a time when we, genuinely, needed it the most...there is no app, and frankly no other form of reality as we know it, that could have, WOULD have, come up any bigger...on the biggest stage, with the biggest stakes, TextMe helped immensely to keep my family (5 kids, 4 still with us, PLUS 1 as we VERY unexpectedly lost the greatest Mommy the world will ever know during premature birth)...Daddy has just overcome Stage IV Cancer (Mommy is the reason for this miracle, make no mistake), given a 10% chance...look, ""fate"" apparently never met my magical wife, my Dream Girl Erin, nor did it meet an app, or any other forum, that could keep a family engulfed in love since moment #1 UNIFIED.  Unified in a way that connects our children to safety,security, optimism...HOPE...in their hearts.  ""HOPE sees the invisible, feels the intangible, and achieves the impossible...""Not without this app, I can personally say without absolute certainty... TextMe, I hope you read this (forget everyone else) & you can hear me say THANK YOU, from the bottom of my heart",Yes
"This app is inconsistent. Some of the time texts send, but others, they are blocked by TextMe because of ""Spammingsecurity"". It does this every time I have a conversation over text. To fix it you have to submit a request online and hope they answer it. Once they do, they'll just block your texts again next time you have a conversation. Not good.",Yes
"This is an unfair review because I never got past the sign in.  I felt the sign in (up) was way too intrusive and then I had to sign up for another phone number.  This seemed a little too much just so I can text with my friends who own Apple products.  This all may be a misunderstanding of how the Fire works.  At this point, I'm ready to spend a little more and get an IPad mini.",Yes
This app messed up my tablet for a long time finally got all my apps is ok for texting I think pinger needs to fix its  phone thing because I called my cell phone it would not let my hang up witch scared me because I thought it would keep calling my cell phone don't get this app I don't think texting is good on it at all now so.please don't download this app,Yes
It is awesome. My mom thought it would not work well but I am able to text lots of family and friends. You have to have 2 things. WiFi.CreditsThe credits help you call. Awesome texting app. No inappropriate stuff. No strangers can reach you the only random contact is text me. And you can delete that. BUY THE APP!!!!!!!!!√∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???,Yes
"It worked great when I first installed it about 3 weeks ago then the updates made some parts stop working and it does not always receive texts and can't always send them.I use to be able to see how much credit I had in stock but that feature has also disappeared now.How come updates make things a lot worse, I thought they were meant to make the app better !Not on this app !!",Yes
"Having an extra step ofsecurity is comforting, especially with all the problems caused by less than honorable people.",Yes
"Installed it on my girl's Kindle. Maybe I misunderstood, but I thought it was a free app that I could use for my kids. After a couple of months, my kids couldn't use it anymore and I got a text from someone asking me who I was. Turns out that the phone # assigned to me from the TextMe app was given to another person for their new cell phone.",Yes
It shows up everywhere.  No control over limits.,Yes
Installed it. Tried to use it. Turns out the person I wanted to text also has to have the app on their device. I thought it was just going to let me text message them and they'd receive it normally. Nope. Uninstalled it.It was like it was 1998 all I had MSN Messenger while my friends had AOL again. LOL.,Yes
This app has been working really well for me the last texting app I had didn't allow kindles to text anymore so when I found it I thought irt was destiny!and now that I have it I can't stop texting,Yes
"Thought it was""free"", but found out that was only partially true.",Yes
To easy for minors to download and circumvent parent controls.  My child almost ran off with a older man she had been talking too.,Yes
"Says it is free, but the only way to really get it to work is to pay for it with a subscription.  I thought it would be a good thing for my daughter now that she is learning to stay home by herself occasionally. But no.  It really just sucked.  Hard to use. Not worth it at all!",Yes
"i think this app is the best texting app there is! it loads really quickly, and its easy to find out how to control it. you can have as many contacts as you want. the best thing is, its free! you may think a free texting app is going to be bad but its a really good app. its even better than amazing!",Yes
Thought I could use this on my kindle fire. Isn't working.  :(,Yes
originally i thought this app was great. free texting was awesome with limited calling. in the end i could never watch videos to get more credits and now it refuses to send any texts after only being used for 2 weeks. filling out the surveys and promotions to get credits doesnt work either. this app is garbage.,Yes
"We were excited to add this app to my daughter√¢??s device as a communication tool, but shortly after we downloaded it, inappropriate ads began popping up. Then most recently, a man began texting her using my cell number so she thought it was me. We deleted the app immediately.",Yes
"not clear how to use.  (I have texting proficiency).  Thought that it would piggy back off my existing phone number.  I didn't want a second number for people to have to keep up with.  Glad it was free, have already deleted from my kindle",Yes
Thoughtful,Yes
"I put this on my daughters kindle to stay in touch with her during spring break. I thought the ads were annoying but didn't see anything bad. Today she received a  dirty and very disturbing  text and I believe was not an error, but robo text. I I highly advise against allowing children to have this app.",Yes
"I couldn't even get past creating my account , I believe the good reviews are lies",Yes
"I loved it for a while but when you log out, you loose all your messages/conversations. Also, recently I couldn't text most of the people I want to because I can't receive their texts, I can send them but can't receive. I would also like to be able to see videos that people send me. I thought this would be great because I don't have a phone and its free but its making me angry...so an update or something would be nice√∞???",Yes
We downloaded this app on our son's Kindle but we have Parental Controls on so he cannot access the web browser. Through this app he was able to click on an ad and then access You Tube. He watched pornography through this app. Do disappointing that this app didn't block it AND that the Kindle Fire parental controls didn't block it.,Yes
"It's OK, but the ads pop up underneath the texts, making it look like it WAS a text. I had to ask my friend if she was trying to advertise a hamburger  √∞?¬ç? once because I thought that SHE was the one that sent it. It's also really slow, has a lot of ads, will erase people's # after a certain period of time, and all of the things like changing someone's picture, adding more people, etc. is so confusing. Also, you have to pay a fee if you want to constantly remove ads. Otherwise, it's OK.",Yes
"I  wanted this app so that in transitioning between cell phones, or if my one and only cell was for some reason not functioning, lost, etc., I would have some sort of backup for communication. TextMe IS the answer. I have it on my Kindle Fire. It took me a while to get it all figured out, but with some time and patience, I eventually succeeded. It works great. The only down side is that to get it for free, you must use an assigned number. However you can both text AND make calls from your tablet! It gives me greatsecurity to know I have this backup in place.",Yes
At first this app was cool. I could call and text for free. But the credits suck. Do not get this app. I have a friend that is going to another school. I was very sad and when I saw this app I thought it was a good way to communicate with her. But it turns out that I was wrong. This app sucks do not get it. I am glad that it was FREE.,Yes
"This app is AMAZING! (And no, I'm a not making one of those fake reviews) I can text a lot of people at the same timePROS√Ç¬∑Text no matter what device then other person has√Ç¬∑Isn't a limit on how long or much you TEXT√Ç¬∑You can call and video call√Ç¬∑You can add on stickersCONS√Ç¬∑One word, and yes, this is used in many texting app reviews: CREDITS(But how else are they gonna make money, I don't blame them)The reason I gave this app 4 stars instead of 5 is because one time it logged me out. I couldn't get back in with my account, so I had to make a new account, and I woke up and freaked out my friends because they thought a stalker was texting them. (You have to get a new number)P.S. You can still text without credits for a long time.",Yes
"My phone was stolen and I thought I was SOL. Thanks to this app, that's not the case. Plus it works I. Kindle!! Highly recommend this app!",Yes
"I hope everyone now realizes that no matter what the claim, NOTHING is free.  That being said I thought I would try this anyway. Downloading time was about 30 seconds. When it wanted me to choose one of their phone numbers I already didn't like it but figured somehow that has something to do with how the app makes money.  Continuing on I entered the info it asked of me including my age which again I decided was for advertising purposes. I was sure I would be bombarded with ads since the app was ""free"".  I sent a text to my son's iPhone first since I was sure he was going to tell me all the reasons why I should've installed this app.  As soon as I sent the text more ads than I could have imagined flooded the page.  I had to search for the text response from my son which simply said ""where did this number come from, what did you do""? Haha!  I decided all this 'free"" wasn't worth it. I uninstalled the app right then.  I do want to text from my Kindle Fire so I'll keep looking for a compatable app where I can hopefully use my own phone number.",Yes
When i downloaded the game i thought it wouldn't be to good but once i got it and started using it started growing on me and all my friends have phones and i cant get one and this makes up for it i can send pictures and video's and texts no problem and u just found out how to do everything and it is awesome so i definitely recommend it i have never got a better app im my life and you get better stuff than just emojis you get huge ones but you cant send regular emojis but other than that the game is the best game everPs sorry this is so long,Yes
"The TextMe app is better than Messenger Kids. Messenger Kids was a bit too strict with passwords and parental controls. But when you use Textme, you can add phone numbers without having to put in passwords like Messenger Kids. TextMe is a great app.√∞???√∞???√∞???",Yes
It's awesome!! You can text anybody even if they have a differnet device!!!! Plus you don't need WiFi!! If you are somewhere with no WiFi this app does not contain any! Especially if you don't have the regular messages app or you don't have an Apple and Samsung phone!! Thanks for creating this app now I can text my family and friend wherever I go!! Even if I do not have the same device cause I don't or have the same regular messages app!! √∞???√¢?¬∫,Yes
"I downloaded this while on a train when my phone was dying so I couldn't text. It worked well enough for what I needed it for. A few points I didn't like...* They didn't specify in the description that I'd get a separate phone number. I don't know how I thought it would work, but somehow I thought it would just work through the wi-fi connection on the Kindle itself. Wishful thinking maybe. Anyway, then from my dying phone, I had to text the number to the two people I wanted to text, since it wasn't entirely user-friendly to know how to start a new text to someone. It takes you straight to inviting your contacts...of which, of course, I had none. I know *now* how to do it, but at first, it was frustrating.* It doesn't alert you when you have a new message. Not easy, then, to be reading your book and know when you have a new message unless you keep checking. (And on the Kindle, unlike my phone that shows what programs I have open, I'm not finding as easy to do - swap between programs. Maybe that's a newbie issue for me.)I don't know if I'll continue to use it in the future; I might end up deleting it. But for that instance it worked well enough.",Yes
I read the reviews and I thought it would be a grate app... but it crashed every time I tried to open it!  I used my Kindle Fire HD to download this app but it crashed. As I've said.  It looks like a great app. And I wish it would've worked.  Still download it to see if you can open it. If your any luckier than I am!,Yes
This app won't let me get in with creating a new phone number and I want to use my old one.√∞???,Yes
"Its great that you can pick a number from an area code of your choosing but it lags because of incessant ads in your feed pop up ads that are starteling at times if you have a headset onYeah its ""free"" but at the cost of missed text unsent text and constantly hitting pop ups as you try to tap on a name.. But that capitalism.",Yes
I thought it would let me sync my phone and tablet with the same number but it gave you a new one and made you make an account?! How sad! √∞???,Yes
"Scammers are using this app. I listed a car for sale on Craigslist and I I have been greeting text scams from different numbers and when I call them back, I get the you have reached your friend on text me. And so forthText me needs to put somesecurity in its app or every legitamate consumer that uses it is in danger of scamming",Yes
Super easy to navigate even for a texting rookie like me. Highly recommend for those that may be social media/technically challenged....,Yes
I've been using this app for almost 3 years now.It used to be great but since a few months my phone doesn't ring anymore when a call is coming in!All I get is the notification ring for a MISSED CALL!At first I thought it was my phone.  But I've tried it on 3 different ones since and have the same issue on all of them?!,Yes
"This a great app for emergency situations where you do not have a phone for whatever reason. Also, buying the talking minutes are significantly cheaper than most cell phone plans and other text apps. Great service.The down side to this app has to be the advertisements and low volume control while talking.",Yes
I just started but enjoy it already. I work for a multicultural company where many languages are spoken. I only need/want  to learn the basics of about 5 languages because I would like to make communication easier for everyone especially when it comes to the training process. This program will definitely help me a ton. I also have friends that speak other languages so now I can surprise them.,Yes
"It IS in fact, the best product on the market that I have encountered, but the price is quite high -- I found the free app ""Duolingo"" to give it a run for its money for the more commonly taught languages, and there is a lot that can be cobbled together from various sites and YouTube.I had purchased and worked with Rosetta Arabic ! about 10-12 years ago when investigating ""self-instructional"" language programs for students at my university. I found the pedagogy a bit lacking. This year, I took advantage of their ""back-to-school"" half-off sale  and find it much improved -- the on-line version, anyway. The first part of a lesson is an overview of the material, then it is broken down into focusses on discrete skill areas - listening, grammar, reading and writing. Every two weeks, you get a 45-min. session with a tutor via a form of Skype.I haven't investigated the games function yet, since I haven't gotten that far. Like all learning products, it requires self-discipline and motivation,but the pacing of the materials keeps you going.Some, but rather few, of the pictures and graphics are culturally appropriate. I think for verbs and everyday activities, they use the same photos for all the languages.",Yes
I thought it was free.  Once I got in the app they wanted $199.  Total bs,Yes
I have been able to speedily gain an accurate understanding of the language that I am currently studying through this app. It is very easy to work with an I have experienced little problems with the app. I'm am enjoying my learning experience.,Yes
"My only complaint is the writing not being available. True, you can only try a small ""lesson"" free, but what seems to be one lesson is just a quarter of one! I tried the free demo to make sure I would enjoy it and loved it! In some ways it even felt like a game. I did pretty well, so decided to invest in a three month subscription. As soon as I started the second part of the first lesson, BAM! It felt more challenging so I knew I would have to try hard to keep up and pass. I felt like I was really going to be taught the language, even I did have to repeat lessons to understand things. But its fun and learning something like this that I always wanted to learn gives me confidence so I really don't mind! Still, I do wish the writing part was available. I think being able to do it would strengthen my skill and understanding with my new language.",Yes
I was looking for something to refresh my Spanish and this is not it.  It would be good for someone learning for the first time as it has good vocabulary re-enforcement but was to basic and repetitive for my needs. I needed a more traditional spanish class,Yes
"I was impressed with how well the scenarios were thought out. The voice recognition is excellent supports proper pronunciation.  By. The review of the lesson, you are reading, speaking, and understanding the language.  It not just memorization, but an actual understanding of the language.",Yes
"They toss you in to it, but fairly quickly it gets easier and you find yourself understanding what you are doing as you go on.",Yes
The pictures and the repetition make this the easiest way to learn! Instant gratification and understanding! Love it!,Yes
"I absolutely loved this free app. However, after the free 1/2 hour of level one, you need to make a purchase to unlock the rest of the program - which I was happy to do, but I couldn't  simply purchase the app for my kindle. Instead I was directed to Amazon to purchase the software for my pc. The free app was a terrible and misleading tease. You went to all the trouble of creating a great app, why not allow us to buy it?!!!",Yes
It is wonderful. I am learning so much more then I thought I would. My progress in Portugues is improving daily because I am able to use the Rosetta Stone.,Yes
"thought it would be fun, but...",Yes
Easy to understand and follow. Gives a better understanding of the sound versus  the spelling of French. I rate this very high because I have tried other apps. Be ready to concentrate with sound and the visualization. It makes you pay attention.,Yes
"I was very disappointed to learn that the games option is not available on the mobile app.  I think having at least a basic understanding of the Spanish language would be helpful. It felt like starting a movie in the middle and at first I became frustrated, but eventually I caught on. I got a great deal on a six month subscription. I think if I'd paid full price I would be seeking a refund, but I think I'll keep it. I can see the potential.",Yes
I thought it's a very interesting product and I hope to continue using it in the future,Yes
"This lesson challenged not only being able to pick the right picture based on visual clues, but also your ability to pronounce and read the language.  Definitely a worthwhile and fun exercise!",Yes
Good to learn and speak a lagueage one thought impossible to learn.,Yes
"My purpose in downloading the App  was to gain access to one or both of 2 languages which I already own. I purchased both German & French, all 5 levels of each, several months ago directly from Rosetta Stone and wanted to transfer those to my  7th generation Kindle and if needed uninstall from one of my 2 computers. Even the original purchases from Rosetta Stone were not what I thought they were, Version 4 which I was told took advantage of wide screen laptops. Instead the DVDs were Version 5 which is another name for Version 3. I guess I'll just have to go back to using my Dell or Apple laptop computers and forget about using my Kindle when not at home.",Yes
I love Rosetta Stone. I have used it in a classroom as an end of class supplement. It is a fun way to challenge yourself and enhance your world with more skills.,Yes
"Rosetta Stone really does make learning a new language easy and feels quite natural.The Kindle ap is excellent for learning the sounds, understanding the spoken and written word of a new language.The only real downside I've noted deals with keeping track of plurals, special rules, feminine versus .masculine or neuter and first person, second person, third person usages.  These are there and they are practiced but they are not clearly explained.  A great deal must be inferred.  But then, this is the natural way our babies learn their languages as well.  None the less, after the first few sections, I did pick up an inexpensive grammar book to answer and clarify some of these questions.By the way, Rosetta Stone is NOT free, only the mobile interface application is free.  But  I did not expect Rosetta Stone to be free.  It's a well designed, well presented study program.  I wouldn't expect this level of quality to be free.",Yes
"I have been bilingual for seven years. I thought I knew everything, but this showed that I was wrong! I am still learning",Yes
I'm comparing this to another language learning app. Seems better to me.  More repetition and real life pictures of objects and actions,Yes
Didn't know that there would be a cost to do anything with this app. They sure did not say so. Thought that we could try it to see if we wanted it.,Yes
"I chose Russian and I guess they assume you know anything about the Russian language. Which I did not. Spelling, Pronunciation... its all different. After the first lesson I was very confused. I thought for sure it would cover the basics of the language before going to words and phrases.",Yes
"At first I thought it would take me like a day or two for me to learn,but I am learning other languages in minutes. It's either that this app is a good teacher,or that I am a good student . Either way I am giving this app a four star",Yes
Love it!!! It really challenges you....like the fact you can redo....like to perfect before going on!!! Thank you for helping to bridge the gap without it costing a fortune!!!,Yes
I thought rosetta stone was supposed to be the easy way to learn a language. I think I spent more time on the trial trying to figure out what the pictures meant and what it wanted from me on certain screens-directionless!...lmao...I guess it might work for others. Not sure if I'd buy into it.,Yes
love itthis app really was a refreshed for me. kudos to those individuals responsible for creating this app.sincerelyJohnson _,Yes
"I was very excited to to have Rosetta on my kindle, because I have it on my lap top and thought it would be so convenient on my kindle, but I can't get it to work.",Yes
"First of all, they only give you ONE free lesson!  And the first lesson is the absolutely most basic.  I have studied Spanish in High School and thought myself a later beginner, so I would have to pay the big bucks to get to a challenging level.  Then, their voice recognition feature didn't work for repeating words for proper pronunciation.  I repeated 'Hola"" a dozen times (and I have been told I have a good accent) and each time was told Incorrect which made me feel like a chastised dummy!  Their teaching felt more like punishing instead!",Yes
great! easy to learn! never thought speaking French could be so easy!!!! so excited to go to France and use my french now!,Yes
app slowly eases you into learning one step at a time and before you know it you are learning and understanding another language. very awesome!,Yes
I appreciate learning a new language from action photos. I've always felt that associating a foreign language with your native language is an unnecessary step.,Yes
"Annoying Register prompts and $ call to action$ to buy$.  Never was able to get to anything that was a language training sample.  Made an account on line, but nothing to try, only to buy$ first.",Yes
"Um, I felt like this app just started spewing out sentences, full Japanese spellings and all that without starting at the beginning.  I was hoping to start as I were in kindergarten like with what the letters A through Z are and all that.  More importantly, I thought the whole thing was free but I guess only one lesson is free, then they want you to buy lessons.  So, don't bother.",Yes
Love starting my day with a warm coffee and Rosetta Stone. It feels very interactive. The progression from Unit 1 to more advanced lessons really challenges me.,Yes
"It is a good app, but it is expensive to get the lessons that are needed. Mango languages is free, thought not quite as good.",Yes
I'm happy for choosing this software.,Yes
"I have tried many self-study Japanese language courses but I came back to Rosetta Stone because nobody does it better.  The online course works well in this app, with the exception that the writing lessons are not available through it, and being able to study Japanese on my Kindle Fire HD is very convenient.  If you're serious about language study but don't have the time or opportunity for a traditional language school, I highly recommend Rosetta Stone.",Yes
"So far so good just on lesson 2.Already speak Spanish,learned in Madrid,Spain.just brushing UP my skills to adventure into the profession of Translation.Ask to soon to rate.I could have declined,too.lol.Very Helpful as well as accurate.",Yes
"Rosetta Stone isn't my favorite way to learn a language, but it is a good one.I need more structure. I'd rather learn by traditional instruction than be learning as a child would learn a language.",Yes
I never thought I woould detain another language. This xourse has shown me I am not too old to learn Swedish and it has been fun.,Yes
"I have travelled to France five times in the last six years , and although I have enjoyed the trips, I feel I would enjoy my upcoming trip more if I were more fluent in the language.  In the past, I have used Pimsler cd's and various textbooks, but I think Rosetta Stone will be more effective because of the interaction and pronunciation. Ask me in May for an update.  I was hesitant to pay the price, but so far, I think it is worth it.",Yes
i want to give this a zero rating but amazon wont let me.. i thought it would be a one time payment but it wasnt.. dont use this to learn japanese,Yes
First lesson and the complex twist and turns allows for retention. I am eager to continue. I will let you know more as I go deeper into the lessons. Who would have thought it would be so exciting to learn another language.,Yes
"HANDS down the best software to not only learn, but truly master any languageYou desire.  Guaranteed satisfaction is what you will get with this product.",Yes
Easy and fast and challenging.  I am learning faster than I thought I would and because of this I highly recommend this program!,Yes
It was ok I thought it would be a little more.,Yes
Very easy to follow and well thought out. As someone who has struggled with other language learning software I can say this one stands out!,Yes
Easy to use and easy to learn. Great for beginners and children. Makes learning seem easy and free flowing.  I really feel like I can learn and maybe not struggle as much as I had thought.,Yes
I am considering buying this program for my 9 th grader. This app is wonderful. It challenged him and built his confidence at the time...it's great.,Yes
"This is a fantastic mobile companion to the Rosetta Stone full program. There is enough here that you can test it out to see if this learning system is something you'd enjoy and stick to. I will say that I wish the games were on here too, but you have to use the desktop version to access those. Their complexity and interaction with other players/learners makes that understandable, though.",Yes
"Doesn't just track progress, and show status (which, honestly, would've been enough). Instead, it's access to the full courses. BUT, it requires the online subscription version of the software, the disc version doesn't get you anywhere.",Yes
Great app and a true challenge,Yes
I like the approach to learning language that Rosetta Stone uses. I teaches you to speak and identify words with their objects or actions first rather than launching you into learning vocabulary and grammar from the start.,Yes
"These are words I thought would never come out of my mouth! This is a must have for anyone who wishes to learn another language, I am simply having the time of my life with this! I never knew learning could be this much fun until now. If all leaning was structured like this in school, I would have made the Dean's list everytime! Highly recommended! Try it, and get the word out...and no, I am not sponsored, I am just very happy. This tool is not just all fun and games though ( well....almost not all fun and games ), one must put forth the effort, however, each time you practice, the more comfortable you'll become and interested.The lessons are designed not to intimidate you, but for you to challenge yourself at your own pace, and if you know you didn't do well in a previous lesson, the programs are contructed to make  you want to do better and give it another try.My greatest challenge at the moment is; calming myself down and practicing the proper pronunciation of words to utilize the proper diphthong, however, if one keeps getting them wrong, no stress, take a minute ( or two ), breath, and give it another try, what's really cool is, Rosetta Stone makes it so much fun that even repitition doesn't feel like some arduous and frustrating task like some of the other learning ( parrot-like squaking; ""Polly wants a cracker!"" )  software out there. The price makes you want to scream but, once you give it a try ( I HIGHLY recommend the free trial before putting down your hard earned money ) and decide to buy, you'll know that you have made a wise investment if your intentions really are to learn a new language and speak it with confidence. Good luck!Gabriel",Yes
"I love learning this way! I never would have guessed that I could actually learn Japanese this late in life but I am! I'm retaining what I've learned and can repeat it to my friends and understand when I hear it out loud from people on the street and in the market. I studied spanish for 6 of my schooling years but I never pick it up well enough for conversation. I'm not there yet with Japanese but I can tell I'm integrating Japanese into my daily thoughts and expressions more than I ever did with Spanish. I realized as I was teaching my granddaughter words in her world (also giving her the Japanese word), I am learning the same way she is learning to speak English.Great program!",Yes
"After downloading it, signing up and choosing a language, it shuts down. I couldn't even use it!",Yes
This app is incredibly helpful! I'm glad I got it. At first I thought there was probably a catch but no!,Yes
Very well put together program. I am understanding with the greatest of  ease. Thank Rosetta Stone Adios,Yes
"The Kindle Tablet instance of the Rosetta Stone Totale course is a good replication of the web-based tool. It allows full access to the various course and studio capabilities EXCEPT the Kindle Fire will not support student interaction in Speaking mode. Thus, a student can read and interact in writing or via menu selections with the course material, but can not speak with instructors or use the Totale voice recognition software to assess speaking progress. This can be an issue if the stiudent wishes to practice portions of the course that involve speaking.",Yes
"I got this app on my kindle since DuoLingo the app I normally use, wasn't available and thought wow this app is amazing! I learned alot of French for the beginning of the first level and it said I had to purchase more and I was like ok I bet it's just like $5.00 and I'll just pay and learn French. BUT NOOOO. It was freaking 209$! Just for the first five levels! And there's 20! I was not about to learn French for 800$! I just decided to use DuoLingo on my phone because OH MY GAWD this app is greedy. It's a really good learner and I could learn French easily if it was free or ALOT less. If your not ready to pay $800 to learn a language, leave this app alone! It is not worth your time!",Yes
"This is a tough one.  What to review: the series?; or the √¢??app√¢?¬ù?  The series is what it is: intriguing, thought-provoking (some say √¢??controversial√¢?¬ù√¢??when did controversy become a pejoritive term?  Isn√¢??t the First Amendment a formal endorsement of controversy?).  But what about the app?  First of all: why an app?  Why is it not just a folder of videos to select from?  ....?  But it is an app.  As an app, it sux√¢??bronto.  It worked great when we downloaded it.  Look at all those videos!, in all those categories!  Next day: nada.  We get the intro pix√¢??especially like FroDude√¢??but beyond that image: nada (but I repeat myself).  We√¢??ll give it another go; see what happens.  This really should be easier.",Yes
"TED has a lot of great content. No video (by design) is more than 20 minutes long so, you can learn something new in less than a half hour investment of your time. You√¢??ll be surprised how 20 minutes can change the way you see the world you thought you knew.",Yes
"It used to be something special, to sit down and watch some of the most fascinating lectures on many a subject. Today, it has become a forum for product placement and half-thought-out ideas, soft-science and anyone who *thinks* he/she can do as well as the great first adopters of this great idea. It is no longer selectively showing excellent lectures. It's a shame that this forum has succumbed to its initial success. Where to go from here?",Yes
"Usually, when I turn this on, I have no idea what is going to be available. This is like being a museum freak in the most wonderful huge museum in the world, only it is right now. So many interesting people, subjects, opinions. It is a totally fascinating door opening into the world of human thought. I may not agree, but I am really glad to see a place where just about everyone has a voice.",Yes
"Disappointed.  I could not search other topics.  Seems to be totally consumed with only Global warming and pollution topics only.  It could be my lack of operational understanding of the software.  referring to the above star ratings.  What does ""Thickness"" and ""Warmth"" has to do with this?  This is not a winter coat.",Yes
"I√¢??d heard about TED Talks and when I saw the app it finally gave me an easy way to view them.  Lots of topics - short enough to not lose my attention - moving - thought provoking - heart warming - funny.  I√¢??d like a better way to search since if any words do not exactly match the entire list disappears, but use TED online and find your talk.",Yes
"I am so amazed  by the diversity of information highlighted in these short talks on incredible ideas, experiences and interactions . Every talk I have watched has filled my mind with the joy of knowing that human curiosity and passion is live and well in our world.

"One of my favorite pastimes is watching TED Talks. Amazing variety of subjects, presented with charm and passion by persons with deep understanding. I've never regretted one of the hundreds of TED Talks I've watched. To have them available on my new Kindle Fire is even better. TED Talks give me access to some of the most brilliant minds and most committed persons on Earth, and I now have that access where I once did not thanks to the convenience of Kindle.",Yes
"If you listen to TED talks on the radio on PBS you can now see the people who are the Speakers of these talks on various subject matters. There are thousands of videos to choose from, which I have spent several hours viewing after DL this App to my Kindle Fire Device.

One speaker after another stressed the importance of strong social connections, both multi-generational family and friends.  It seems virtual interactions do not count.  All very interesting!",Yes

"Minor technical issues: when video started buffering, the ubiquitous ""spinning wheel"" icon appeared to indicate the issue. Unfortunately when video started playing again, the icon remained visible throughout the rest of the episode. I also had issues with the auto-hide feature of the play controls.

"Do you know someone that seems to know something about everything? You know, someone always able to provide an interesting slant on the moral issues surrounding new technologies and the old problems they're solving. The first person to know about things beyond the cutting edge, who shares with you what Bill Gates, Stephen Hawking, or President Clinton think about issues facing the world. I can tell you something about that person: They know TED.TED is my daily moment of Zen; it's salt for the world, adding flavor to everything it touches; it's conference around the world discussing local issues that have, or will have, global influence; it represents the modern view of knowledge, that only by sharing and collaborating can we achieve the impossible, know the unknowable, where we can, as Aaron Sorkin wrote, look into the face of God.Lofty words.That is the TED spirit. Brilliant, talented, funny people that are experts, or often creators, in their field. You can watch Sergey Brin demonstrate Google Glass, Sir Ken Robinson telling you about how to save your child from schools (I'm a teacher, so no complaints), listen to Stephen Dubner prove working at McDonald's pays better than dealing drugs, or Mike Rowe sharing how important, and thankless, are Dirty Jobs. Musicians, artists, doctors, lawyers, politicians, authors, scientists... The list goes on and on. The topics cover, well, everything. I can't even begin to list the subjects that come readily to mind, just listing my favorites would take a page or two.Someone once said ignorance was bliss; today ignorance is criminal. Issues are facing the world that will affect humanity; some good, some bad, but all coming. Many of these issues require citizen involvement, which requires citizens to be familiar with the issues involved, which means, I suppose, if you want to be a good citizen of the world you must watch TED.I promise this: If you watch at least three episodes, they have a YouTube channel also, and you don't find yourself looking for more that interest you, then I will work hard to get a full refund for you (they're free).So what have you got to lose except some ignorance (remember, ignorance means you just don't know; if you've had the chance to learn something and you didn't, that's stupid).",Yes

Amazing series.  Very thought provoking topics.,Yes
Thoughtful,Yes
"TED is invaluable.  I love the creative angles and testimonials on new and common topics by smart, thoughtful people.  An hour of TED talks stimulates a day of thoughts and inspires you to think of what you can offer others.  The aftermath for TED lovers is long and complex.",Yes
"This is the most wonderful thing I have on my Amazon Fire.  I can learn something new and interesting in 10 or 15 minutes on my big screen.  when I have a few minutes and nothing to watch or fill my time I just hit the Ted button and Watch Anything and a brilliant mind shares some thoughts or information that I would otherwise never had.  I have learned about microbes in my body,  macro art, sewage management and alternate fuel sources on the horizon during the time commercials take up during an hour show.  AMAZING!",Yes
Always thought provoking,Yes
I love this series of discussions/ lectures. It reminds me of when I was in a setting surrounded by people who actually thought for a living. Heady times.,Yes
A great app.  I've heard about Ted conferences for years but have never been.  Now I can watch any of them that seem interesting.  Who ever thought of adding this to the selections is a genius!,Yes
"The review is for TED, not for a specific show as every speaker is different and the topics very varied.I've learned quite a few new things and people through their shows. Some are thought provoking.LIKE!",Yes
"Duolingo is a great program. I have been learning with it for just over two years now (I upgraded to the Pro version) and by studying at home, with just Duolingo, I am now able to read some Spanish novels, read some magazines and newspapers, and I have a general understanding of the language.But ... if you really want to converse with others, you will need more than this to do that. When I listen to Spanish TV or music or a movie, I""m lost. I have Spanish speaking friends and if they speak slowly, I will understand but in order to respond, it will take me too much time to think about how to properly frame the response. If I were asked to write down my response, I could do that more easily than speaking.My point is, this is an excellent program and I enjoy using it and feel accomplished. But, to truly learn the language, you will need interaction with others who are fluent in the language.Let this get you started and, if you find yourself enjoying it, get a tutor, take a Spanish class, or travel and do some immersion learning. As you're taking lessons, Duolingo will help along the way.Great things about DuoLingo -** It has an active discussion group, so if you're confused about an answer, just click and you'll likely see 100's of posts about that issue.** It has a dictionary so that you can find words that are not part of your lesson** As you learn words, it adds them to your personal word list and shows you when you last used that word so that you can practice vocabulary that you might have not used in a while.** You can read stories that are based on your reading level; it is not just grammar.** The Android version is very easy but I prefer to use it on my laptop or Kindle. Fortunately, Duolingo has platforms for all as well as iOS.** It lets you set your own pace and will remind you daily if you've met your goal for the day. You can change the time you spend per day whenever you like.** Duolingo has a podcast as well which is good to practice your listening skills. It may be too advanced, but it's still good to help you learn the flow and tone of the language.I deducted one star because many people will think this IS the answer, when in fact it is only a part of the answer. The program also has a bit of trouble with voice recognition but then, it might be that my Brooklyn accent does not translate well into proper Spanish.",Yes
I have been using this app for the past few months and it really works! I find myself understanding parts of conversations in Spanish when I'm out in stores or flipping through Spanish television stations. It's very simple and fun. More like playing a game than a tedious language lesson. The best part is I'm actually learning! I can't believe this amazing tool is free! Now there is no reason not to be multi lingual!,Yes
"My 1st grader wanted to learn a new language, a friend told me about Duolingo, thought I'd give it a try. I started doing it to stay ahead of him so I could help him if he needed it. Now my 5th grader is doing it to. We are having funny using our new language skills together. Bottom line it can help at a by age.My only 2 critiques would be, a better reward system to keep kids interested. Maybe a reference area to explain a little about how the words are formed to have a better understanding.That being said it is a Free app, so it is great!",Yes
"Duolingo is an excellent language app! It covers listening, writing, reading and speaking. You complete excercises at your own pace.  It also  enables you to redo parts of already completed sections to refresh the vocabulary and grammar you have learnt. It is the best language course I have ever come across.It allows you to listen again to sections to be translated as many times as you want before translating. When you mouse over a word, the English is displayed so this helps you translate when you are stuck on a word you don't know. It also lets you learn  different languages at the same time on the one app just by switching the language at the push of a button! You are awarded ""lingots"" after completing each section which is an incentive to continue as you can buy different additional bonus sections with them. This is a really well thought out language course and to top it all it was a free app! well worth 5 stars!",Yes
"My love of  Italian music prompted my learning the language.  I'm so glad I found this program!  Now I find myself singing along and understanding a lot of it already after only a few lessons!  The program is really easy and fun at the same time, making understanding of the language just fall into place!  My son now uses it and I have it on every device I have! Love, love, love it!!!",Yes
"Duolingo is such a great app for language learning that exposes you to a variety of languages.However, while playing on Duolingo, it is VERY important to remember to also use materials to supplement your learning! Just using Duolingo and nothing else won't help you much with understanding grammar. In addition, I would also recommend you to use the web version as much as possible! The mobile version is slightly easier than the web one because writing out a sentence is just tapping words. :)Have fun!",Yes
"this is an a amazing app and I'm so glad SOMEONE finally had the good thought that paying at least $500 to teach yourself a language is ridiculous. ive done Rosetta stone and this is not only comparable,  but better. it gives you ""lingots"" as prizes for doing perfect on quizzes, and then you can use those to buy stuff for your character,  or even bonus lessons I already speak Spanish,  I learner it inhigh school andill admit,  I'm really good at language. but you don't have to be to use this thing. I also like that it keeps track of your progress on a graph. it makes me want to study harder and harder each day so I get more XP than I did the day before. it truly is an amazing little tool. I work as a receptionist and I study with this app probably about 4 hours a day. I think to learn a language effectively,  you really have to do it everyday. right now, i'm teaching myself Portuguese. I plan to work my way through all the romance languages.",Yes
"I'm surrounded by bilingual, Spanish speaking people, and I thought it was time I made the effort to learn Spanish.  Simple, easy to use, app. My favorite part is, I can go back and repeat a lesson, for a refresher or if I think I've done badly. Pictures to help you learn, voice commands, and sentence structures. It's fun too √∞???",Yes
Tried to log-in with my kindle 7. I thought it was a problem with my password but then I changed my password and I still can't log in. So it must be the app itself.,Yes
"Duolingo rocks my socks. I'm learning German and picked up more in two weeks than I did from taking a whole 4 years of Spanish back in High School. The progression of learning is perfect to me, if I get lost I go back and review. I have this on my phone, PC and tablets so wherever I go I am constantly using this. I'm addicted! Oh, the real kicker, free! No adds, no gimmicks, no stopping your progression and make you buy more content, just free and well thought out and designed language learning!",Yes
Nice and convenient way to begin to study a foreign language or brush up on language of your heritage. I wouldn't claim it as a complete source of study but I would compare it to a cellphone camera. The best camera that you have is the one that you have at the time you need it.,Yes
"I tried to learn Spanish with Rosetta Stone years ago on my pc. I remember getting bored with it within a couple of weeks because it frustrated me. At first I thought that it made sense to learn a new language as a child does, with image and word association. After using it I realized that, as an adult, I wanted to know what the words I was learning meant, not just memorize what noise goes with each image.I don't mean to put Rosetta down, it's worked for a lot of people for a long time. But, Doulingo, in my opinion is much better. Aside from it not costing me anything, it also makes more sense to me to learn a language the way Doulingo teaches it. Instead of learning some words and very phrases over a 3-4 week period (as I did with Rosetta), I have actually learned many more words and longer phrases, and can put them together to say things that are relevant and useful!Also, the the presentation, rewarded skill points, and notifications really help keep me engaged. If feels like a game as much as an educational app. (I wish Spanish 1 & 2 in H.S. had been this fun). My 10 year old enjoys it too. We downloaded it for her ipad, friended each other, and now can track each other's progress and compete.The only issue I've had is occasional freezing on my Kindle Fire HDX 7&#34; and have to restart it. It seems to happen when I'm using a slower WiFi connection than my home network (like my mobile hotspot). Still a five star app in my book. I think I'll learn German after I'm finished with Espa√É?√Ç¬±ol. √É?√Ç¬°Gracias Duolingo, es muy bien!",Yes
"I would have given this a 5 but for the fact that sometimes words are introduced and not translated and the user has to guess what the translation is until later on.  I wonder how they thought you were supposed to know what that word means when it never was introduced with a translation before asking the user to translate it.  Anyway, this is a fun and entertaining way to learn words and phrases in another language.",Yes
"Very good app. I had some knowledge of Spanish, which was helpful in understanding the structure of the Italian language as as Duo Lingo presented the lessons. We are taking a trip to Italy soon and this has been a great app to learn the basics.  You hear, write, and speak in each lesson. Highly recommended.",Yes
"Downloaded this free app to brush up on Spanish (that I studied {badly} in college for two semesters).  The lessons are short and easy to digest, but lack the sort of foundation necessary to learn a new language.I understood verb conjugation before opening this app; had that not been the case, this method may have proved exasperating.  In word matching vocabulary drills, the word ""eat"" pairs as a correct response to all of the following: como (I eat), comes (you {familiar} eat); come (you {formal} eat; comemos (we eat); comeis (you plural {familiar} eat); and comen (you plural/they {formal}) eat.  A more helpful approach would have been to match ""I eat"" with ""como,"" ""we eat"" with ""comemos,"" etc.Showing, not telling is the process used by Duolingo.  Unfortunately, forms of speech are presented without the most basic explanation that is essential to understanding a new language.",Yes
So cool pick any language you want to learn and learn the basics to it then food and sayings it is just great for helping with country transfers and  school learning even though I am not in the school that teaches languages or a country transfer it is so fun and everything is a challenge and I personally love challengesSo please check out this game,Yes
I'm enjoying the app. It's daily reminders keep me consistent. I appreciate being able to go over the previous lessons. I would love if more photos were used. I'm a visual learner and seeing a photo of the action that is occurring assists me with my retention. I.e. They are eating photo of a group of people eating. The children are eating photo of children etc.,Yes
"So far, I've enjoy the application for the different learning levels. It's a nice plus to connect with other that can ""challenge"" you in pursuit of achieving more in desired language. Not sure if one likes that it does the constant reminders of practice time, but sure every good application has ways of modifying things.",Yes
"I have numerous books an have taken classes in the States and Central America and I feel this is a fun and engaging way to study Spanish. The combination of writing, reading, and speaking is important to really understanding the language. My current instructor is a native of Guatemala and provides my classes via Skype. He noted the improvement in my pronunciation and confidence speaking after using this program. I occasionally disagree with some of the translations but reading the comments has taught me a lot. Great language program!",Yes
"This is about the best imaginable app for what it does. I think it would be great if it had more languages (I.e. Mandarin, Aramaic, Arabic, Yiddish, Latin, Ancient Greek, Elfin, etc.) Using this helps a lot with reading, writing and understanding the chosen language. I am thoroughly satisfied with this app and look forward to any improvements. Thank you.",Yes
This has been quite a surprise.  I thought maybe I could learn just a few words to help me when I travel but was happy to see that not only do I learn what can help me there but words that will help me converse with my gardner for example.  Although he speaks English he is more comfortable with Spanish and it gives me a chance to practice.  If you use the mic  you get feed back on how you sound when you speak and if you are pronouncing the words correctly.  You can't beat the price when companies that teach languages can charge hundreds of dollars.  I also like the convenience of having this on my Kindle so I can learn and practice whenever I want.  The only drawback that I can see is that they have a limited number of languages that you can learn at this time.,Yes
"My favorite app. I regret buying rosetta stone... Rosetta stone does not allow you to use the app unless your paying extra every month. And their system is boring. In the other hand, Duolingo keeps you on your toes with daily challenges. And their owl is pretty cute.",Yes
"This app is great, I am so excited to see if I can start understanding Spanish speaking people,and then be able to speak to them. I am 7 levels in and when we drive down the street, I can read the Spanish stores and know what it says, Exciting. The only thing I think would be better to know in the beginning is the numbers, alphabet, and how to pronounce them.",Yes
"This app makes it fun to learn a language.  It has short lessons that help you to understand conversational Italian (my language of choice, but several others are offered). The lessons are well organized and build upon one another.  The format allows the student to have success, which makes you want to continue the process.  Since the format is similar to a game, it challenges you to go to the next level.  I also like the review process that allows you to go back to previous lessons. I'm currently on Level 3 so I don't know how comprehensive the entire program will be, but it definitely appears it will give you a very good foundation in a new language.  The only criticism I have is that the native speaker is sometimes hard to understand and I have to listen to her several times to make sure of pronunciation.  However, that is becoming less of a problem as I become more accustomed to her voice.",Yes
"I loved how this app built on previous lessons to teach grammar through use. I've been on the verge of true fluency in spanish for many years; reading and dreaming but never able to catch more than a few words in conversation or being able to speak. Duolingo was the perfect app for stitching everything together into a comprehensive whole. I've always struggled with grammar in spanish, and this app helped me develop a subconscious understanding. The only complaint I have is that there weren't formal grammatical sections. It would be nice to have lessons strictly on conjugation that I could practice.",Yes
"I've actually not tried this out on my Kindle Fire yet, but I thought it would be a good idea to have it on there, just in case. I do have this app on my iphone though. I've found that it's a LOT easier and more motivating to use this app on mobile devices than it is to do it on the computer. Don't get me wrong, the website/computer version is good and well, but can be a little cumbersome. The app, if you've installed the right keyboards, which I don't think is very difficult (easy on the iphone, not sure about the Kindle yet. It was a Christmas present so I still am figuring it out), it changes automatically to the keyboard you need for each section of the lessons. I'm currently taking several languages, and it's nice to have the proper keyboard, a specified layout, and frankly, a whole lot less hassle.The downside is that the app takes longer to get the site updates. It took about a month for the app to acquire Russian for English speakers after the website launched it. If you don't mind that, then there isn't much of an issue, aside from actually learning the languages, which can be challenging enough, depending on the language and dedication you choose.",Yes
"Over 20 years ago, I lived in Italy for 4 years (not consecutive) and had several group lessons but despite the efforts of my various instructors, I just didn't have the patience to learn the grammar.  My knowledge of vocabulary was good enough for me to communicate and function but I never could get the hang of conjugating verbs, learning about the articles, and spelling words properly.  Later lived in Latin America for 4 years and that messed up my language skills big time!  So, now I speak both languages very poorly - just throwing out words to make a mishmash sentence.  A couple years ago I went back to Italy and they asked me if I could speak english because they couldn't tell if I spoke Spanish, Italian or some unknown language!  (Note: My native language is American English)So, I'm returning to Italy again for a 2 week vacation and I'm determined to be better this time and not embarrass myself.  So, I got Duolingo on Feb 20th and believe it or not, I'm truly addicted to the program!  I have a full time job and when I come home I'm tired and yet, every single day, I spend 1 hour to 2 hours working on these mini lessons from Duolingo!  Funny, they are kind of addictive.  They force you to learn the language by making you hear the language, speak the language, interpret the phrase back and forth between languages, to spell it properly, and put it in the correct order.  If you do it wrong more than 3x then, it kicks you out of the lesson and makes you start over, but the lesson is different the next time around.  Now, you would think one would get discouraged, I mean, I've had to redo some lessons about 6x, and yet, somehow, the way it is structured, it makes me want to keep at it and do it right!  I mean it is working on me, one of the most stubborn learners!So there are a multitude of topics at every level (beginning/intermediate/advanced) and within each topic they have 4-8 different minilessons in each topic.  It visually has a graph that shows you where you are at.  And, even when you think you are done with a topic (whew), every couple of days, that topic reopens and they make you practice it again so you don't forget!  Wow!  So, even with my background knowledge/vocabulary of Italian, I'm still at the very end of the beginners (Level 8; 335 words!) and I've been working hard for a month!  Oh, another downer is I was working on it for 12 days and suddenly it reset and told me I was back on day 1.  I thought it did that every 12 days but now it says I'm at 16 days. (IF ANYONE READS THIS FROM DUOLINGO; I WANT IT RESET TO FEB 20TH THAT I'VE DONE IT EVERY SINGLE DAY!).The downside is that if you have never ever studied a latin language this would be super hard for you.  I think if you already know a similar language like spanish and how it is structured, it will be easier for you.  However, if you are a person who has never studied a romance language and absolute beginner that only knows Ciao, etc..and hever had a lesson, then, you will have a hard time.  Also, if you are a miserable speller in your native language, learning to spell Italian will kill you because it is so difficult to get all of the vowels in the right place.  I have many times translated a very complicated sentence from english to Italian, only to get it counted wrong cuz I misspelled 1 letter!  But, it forces me to really think what I'm writing and how it all comes together to form a complete sentence.  Also, it really doesn't teach you the vocabulary or the grammar rules, at all.  I kept failing the lesson because I wasn't sure what some articles meant because they seem to mean different things at different times.  Yesterday, I finally broke down and got a grammar book so I can look up what all of the articles mean.  So, this program works for people who are already familiar.  I'm worried that when I get in the more immediate level, I might need to study before using this as it isn't really a good teacher - doesn't explain or introduce new concepts.  Good for people that really want to tighten up what they already know and go farther.",Yes
"I am using this app to brush up on Spanish (learned 30 years ago) and German (picked up from my German family, but never studied formally).  I don't know how it would work for a language you were never exposed to before, but for brushing up purposes it is excellent.  You can easily test out of what you already know and focus on the areas that are weaker.  I also like that you are working on so many skills at once--from fairly passive translation (choosing from a list of English words), to straight translation in both directions, plus dictation and oral practice.  I mainly use it on my Kindle but also have it on my android phone.  Many thanks/muchas gracias/vielen Dank to the developers for keeping it free and ad-free!  Hoping they will add Russian to the list.",Yes
"This is a great app for learning a new language. It's entertaining and I've learned far more than I ever thought I would. I'm not very good with picking up new languages, so if this app was able to teach me then it can teach anyone.",Yes
"A girlfriend of mine and I are going to Europe later this summer, and I wanted to brush up on my French as she is fluent in German. It has been a great refresher course. I started out by trying to test out of some of the common phrases and found that I needed work on some of my tenses and grammar. The game utilizes both English and French (German, Italian or Spanish, depending on which language you choose to learn) words and sentences along with your device's built-in microphone to have you practice saying some phrases yourself. (This function can be turned off. If you're in a noisy, crowded place or don't want to be overheard.)The program, breaks down the learning of the language in much the same way as Rosetta Stone. That is to say that unlike your high school language teacher, you're not just learning active verbs or inactive verbs or pronouns in each lesson. You are learning phrases and how to build conversational structures.A couple of words of caution, however.The app assumes you have a basic understanding of the language you're learning. For example, I have a high school level knowledge of French, and this is been an excellent refresher course and brought back much of what I learned in school. However, when I switched over to try and learn a few German phrases so that I could be just as helpful on our trip, I found it more difficult and challenging to to engage with the program. That isn't to say, that someone could just try to pick up a language (for instance, I'm also working with the Italian section of the app. So when we go through Italy, I'll have some knowledge of the language.Second, the app won't let you advance to the next segment until you can complete the first without four or five errors per segment. Although it's not, strictly speaking, concerned with spelling as long as you're in the neighborhood, it will deduct points if you consistently spell something wrong or don't use the right accent over a letter.Overall though, I have really enjoyed using this and would recommend it to someone who wants to brush up on a language or learn key phrases in order to travel.",Yes
"I think that it would be difficult to learn a language the way Dualingo is presented.  Words are introduced  tasking the learner to translate the word......so must guess what the word is and find out meaning by failing.  At the end, one may be better able to read the language but speaking or understanding the spoken language not so.much.",Yes
"Was turned on to this by my younger sister and I am now addicted. I have taken Spanish for 12 years, and this app has helped me strengthen my ability in not only speaking the language, but understanding it spoken at a normal rate. It's a lot of fun, too! Whether you are looking to learn a language, or to just looking to do something in your spare time, I highly recommend this app!",Yes
"I wish my Kindle Fire had a microphone. I can't use the conversational parts of this app. Otherwise, it's a pretty good app. It might be better if at some point it took you through the alphabet and how accents and pronunciation works (for Spanish). It's an easy system and I've always thought knowing that was helpful.",Yes
"I am trying to learn Japanese, and I thought this would help me. Sadly when I opened it I saw it wasn't there. But it was great for the languages it does have! Therefore I am giving it 5 stars. I sure hope Japanese will be included in the next update.",Yes
i love this program! the way it teaches you language is fun and easy and a bit of a challenge. i mean you get to learn to read write (type) and speak a language all at once. and this was waaaay more affordable than rosetta stone and probably works the same way. DONT EVER TAKE THIS AWAY! i would be very upset because i love this program so much. one suggestion though: add more languages,Yes
"Duolingo is fun.  I took Spanish way back in high school and thought it time to refresh.  Duolingo provides a great experience allowing you to hear, speak, read and write in the language of choice.  In addition it offers an opportunity to share the experience with others.",Yes
"Duolingo is the most motivating language course I've ever seen.  It feels like a game, and is designed to keep you moving forward.  It is also concise and surprisingly comprehensive.  Each part has a lesson to read at the beginning, and if you don't understand why you got an answer wrong, there are discussion boards for each and every question.  So far I have not had a question I could not get the answer to, and I am almost halfway through.  I especially like how it encourages me to go back and strengthen skills in constant review.  This ensures that what I learn will eventually get written in my long term memory, its just a matter of time and consistency.  Anybody who uses Duolingo frequently, consistently, and for a long period of time (at least a year) will learn a new language.  Go ahead and get the answers wrong as often as you need to.  The algorithms are designed to program the human brain and you will eventually find yourself getting answers right in spite of yourself, even if you don't quite understand the grammatical principles behind it all.  Duolingo is built on principles of positive reinforcement, making it easier to persevere.  I use it in conjunction with short stories written in the language I'm trying to learn, and movies also in the language with English subtitles.  In only a month, I am understanding so much morevthan I ever thought possible.  I can't believe its free.  Its better than programs I've paid good money for.",Yes
"Duolingo is great for starting a new language - especially Spanish or French. Great variety of languages too. Once you finish the skills tree you have to keep up the language through independent study (books, movies, conversations).",Yes
I love Duolingo! It's so easy and fun to use! Hardest part is choosing which language(s) to do.,Yes
I really like the way this app varies presentation and gives immediate feedback.  The daily challenge is a gteat way to keep motivated.  Only suggestion:  I wish there was a way to also look up a word - sometimes I want to compare the ending of a verb with different pronouns to see/hear/study (or to look and compare female versus male nouns. ). Otherwise great app.,Yes
"This is an awesome app! I knew 45 words in Spanish in two weeks, so I totally thought I'd impress my Spanish teacher because school was starting soon. Sadly, I didn't make it into Spanish, but I'm continuing improving my Spanish with this app. I now know, according to Duolingo, 85 words. I'd recommend this app to all who need to know a language in a short amount of time.",Yes
"This is just fun, and of course a learning tool. Although I am a fair Spanish speaker, it never hurts to practice and challenge myself so I keep trying things that might improve my fluency. This will definitely go into my frequently used digital tool box.  It can be used any time , and anywhere, and i find myself using it at least once a day.",Yes
This has been a huge improvement in my language learning! The quality is great and it is FREE! I prefer this over my Rosetta Stone software which was super de duper expensive. It is fun and there are challenges and I can even challenge my husband to a dual. Great App and I recommend it to everyone. I am learning Italian and the app is just fantastic.,Yes
"Nice system, impressively multilayered, with solid native speakers.  I like the reinforcing tasks, and the challenges in spelling and pronunciation.  As a multilingual fellow, I use it to polish my skills and cross-check all my languages. Only gap---have a book at your side to fill in gaps, and for technical points.Recommended!",Yes
"Duolingo is a great way to gain an intermediate understanding of a language for free. However some basic knowledge of verb conjugation and grammar is required for most to fully understand the lessons, but this can be acquired for free online from places like youtube etc. Also Duolingo can be a useful supplementary app if you are learning a particular language at school. I started Duolingo when I started taking Spanish classes at school and noticed a big positive change in my understanding of the language. Unfortunately for now only a few European languages are offered. It would be nice to see other languages like Mandarin,Hindi,Arabic, and Swahili as well. Fix this and I will give Duolingo the full five stars this exemplary language learning program deserves.",Yes
"This app is fun, even when you are dabbling in more than one language at a time. I have been playing with it for awhile and have figured out most of the hints, but it took awhile. It would be nice if there were more directions on all the help that it offers along the way. I recommend it to several friends and family, including the kids. We challenge each other with the points. And my husband is quite entertained with everyone's attempt at pronunciation.",Yes
"I totally enjoy this app.  It's fun and keeps you on your toes.  When you get something right, it's time to celebrate.  It challenges you to use your brain to think and transpose Italian to English and English to Italian.  That's the best way to learn, I think.  I plan on spending a lot of time with this app and feel that Duolingo will help me learn Italian.",Yes
My sister in law is bilingual and so I thought I'd try to learn a little bit of her language. This app is amazing and has made me relearn what I've forgotten since high school. Maybe soon I can have a full conversation with her and her side of the family! Lol,Yes
I am 72 yes old and learning French.  I never took French in school so it is a challenging subject to keep my mind active.  It really gives you a chance to learn all aspects  of the language at your speed.  You can go back and redue your steps so you don't forget what you thought you had learned.  Who knows I may go to France someday.,Yes
"Admittedly, I am a language geek. But I have been coming back to this app over and over since getting a Kindle for Christmas to learn Italian, and my 11-year-old daughter has been enjoying learning French. It turns language acquisition into a game with new challenges and rewards at each level. Typical challenges include speaking into a microphone, filling in missing words, and typing in sentences that are dictated or written in the other language. It's a little frustrating to have to type accurately in the target language, though.",Yes
"I use duolingo to teach English to Mexican kids.  I also introduced a friend, a retired Mexican pediatrician, to the program. He thought he could not learn English, but in just a few months he can carry on a conversation.  I use the Spanish course and it is perfect for my needs.  My friend is 75 years old, I am 68 years old, and my kids are 8, 10, and 11 years old, proof that the program works for all ages.",Yes
This makes learning fun. The repetition and interaction between languages really helps. I like use of sentences that are practical and useful for everyday conversation. Thanks,Yes
"I love love love this app! It is super fun, and challenges me on many levels. The app helps me translate English to German and vice versa. I also learn grammar and vocabulary in a fun way. The best part for me is using the microphone where I must put my German pronunciation to the test. There's no cheating here! Try this. You will love it. I've tried many different ways to learn German, but this one is the stickiest. Have fun!",Yes
"Great app! This is an evolutionary way to learn new languages. It drives you with gaming features and makes your progress visible and shareable. Great for adult learners who are able to extract concepts from examples.I have been using this app to learn all languages  supported, and it has been a great  linguistic adventure. I wish it had more consistent paces across languages so I could compare and contrast the same unit in each language.Not 5 stars because of occasional content errors and synthesized pronunciation. Also, providing a lexicon and/or some other sorts of summarization of what had been covered would help me review.",Yes
"In retirement, my husband & I are traveling more extensively, often to Europe. I studied Spanish & German in high school 50 years ago. I chose Duolingo to brush up on Spanish. After completing some of the early levels, I thought I could complete some of the early levels in Italian to prepare for an upcoming trip to Italy. Duolingo is fun & easy to use even for me. I am one who doesn't learn languages easily. I hope my 8 & 10 year old grandsons might have interest to learn alongside me.",Yes
"I do have some experience in languages (Air Force language school, Rosetta Stone, text books etc.), and while no app can replace having multiple native speakers all day every day (the Air Force language school), this one is solid. My daughter challenged me to try it briefly, and I'm on a 815-day streak! (and downloaded it for my newer Kindle). It only takes a few min a day, it does good to encourage and challenge you, and while it's imperfect, I think it works to just oversimplify the grammar at first, then differentiate it as you learn. You can also choose from a large variety of languages (so I've tried some others for fun), as well as reverse it (i.e., learn English as a native speaker of the other language), which adds to your learning (since instructions are in your actual target language and some of the specific vocab is different.",Yes
"Great, my problem is I can't access all of the features I've seen other people use. I thought it was because I have a tablet sort thing and the people who had the things I want were using phones, but my sister can't either and she's using a phone. So I don't know what's wrong.",Yes
"I speak Spanish pretty well.  The Spanish version is kind of fun but is not advanced enough to improve my Spanish.  I tried the French version because I learned French in school and it really got me back into speaking because it reminded me of things I already knew but forgot.  I thought Italian would be easy because it's similar to Spanish.  I at least learned that it is not as similar as I thought.  I don't know if I could really learn to speak Italian this way.  I believe to really learn a language, you need to speak it every day.",Yes
"I love the intuitive nature the program uses--it works the same way we learn language as children.  You build your vocabulary slowly, while teaching you how to communicate in the new language. All that, AND its free!",Yes
For me there is not better way to learn a new language than to have conversational interaction.  Duolingo makes that happen and in such an enjoyable way!  I truly feel that I am finely grasping the understanding of my new language and will be able to use it when traveling.  Thank you Duolingo.  You're the best!,Yes
I absolutely love using this app. I have been trying to really learn and retain Spanish and this app has helped me so much. It starts out with stuff I kinda already know then moves forward to all kinds of levels and subjects that I thought I wouldn't learn. I HIGHLY recommend for teaching children different languages. It is fun.,Yes
"Love this program. I tried 3 others before finding Duolingo. It is easy to use, includes grammar, pronunciation, recreating the language in writing and verbal feedback. I've learned more in 2 weeks with this program than I did in 6 months at a formal school that cost a bundle. Love it.",Yes
"This could complement class room learning, or used completely by itself.It is nice that, at least for me attempting to learn Spanish, that the accents are forgiven to my English keyboard. Also that when using the microphone it is somewhat forgiving to my improper English dialects.It seems to encourage natural learning in many ways. It is kinda hard to explain. The system seems to really utilize my strengths to encourage continual involvement. While simultaneously reiterated over my weaknesses until they become strengths. Using the 'workout' part of the app best shows this routine in action.It is particularly convenient that the learning includes hearing and reading as well as speaking and writing. This helps emphasize the understanding gained of the language. (At least, this is the case with Spanish for me.)Having a desire to give back for those whom made this resource available, especially without financial costs or advertisements, it was noticeable that it is not even possible to donate through the app. This is appropriate for being a true educational resource.After just a few days use it is without doubt they now have my support as I am to provide.",Yes
"This is fun.  Repeating verbs, nouns, pronouns, articles in quick order, using multiple methods ( multiple choice, fill in the blank, translate, repeat)  has the user understanding quicker than had she just been reading vocabulary lists or conjugating verbs.",Yes
I've been using duo lingo for two weeks now about 20 minutes a day. I never thought I could learn a language after one very disappointing semester of college French but I'm very excited about the progress already. I think I might like to see Belize!√∞??¬¥,Yes
This is fun to use. I am learning quicker than I thought I would. I like how you hear the way a sentence should sound and then you get to repeat it back. If there's a of of back ground noise the microphone lesson will not work. It's a great app to learn spanish.,Yes
This is a great way to challenge yourself and gain skills while feeling like you're doing a puzzle or something equally engaging. As addictive as a game without the waste of time because in the end you acquired knowledge.,Yes
"It's fun and is great for learning a language that you have some understanding of. I took 2 years of Spanish in high school and I feel like I'm understanding it better with Duolingo!! My next language will be one I have no understanding of and we'll see how it compares!!All in all, an absolute steal of an app!!!!",Yes
"I do believe this is a wonderful way to learn a new language b aside from living abroad. It starts you off simple then gradually starts to challenge you more and more.I've always wanted to learn another language, and working in the tourist industry r renewed that want. Meeting thousands of people every year and having the ability to speak some of the other languages is a priceless skill and ability. Though this is no completely perfect I cannot wait to brave to speak with my friends from all over the world in their own language.",Yes
"In the past I had used the Rosetta Stone free trial, so when I saw this App I thought it couldn't be as high quality as Rosetta Stone, especially not for free, and especially when Rosetta Stone had such a huge price tag on it.  I put this on my phone and I was pleasantly surprised. It's simple to use and the format is very similar to Rosetta Stone.  A neat feature is the audio portion that allows you to talk back and repeat what you have heard; I'm not saying that it is 100% accurate, but it can be pretty demanding if you keep messing up certain portions.  The app is quick and fun, I just like using it when I have down time, even when I'm waiting on someone/something, I can bring this app up and practice.The only thing I would caution is that I had a year of Spanish, many, many years ago, so I am able to pick up on on non-spoken hints of the program, such as male and female, even if it is not outright saying it.  The program is not going to make you fluent in Spanish, but it does help build a bit of a vocabulary and some rudimentary phrases/terms. There is also a need to put effort in on your part to make sure that you're understanding the rules that it is hinting at as it goes through and is teaching you.",Yes
"My sister recommended this app to practice Spanish, and I'm so glad she did!  I didn't think I'd do well, but it seems I remember much more than I thought.  And I'm learning new ways to say things, also. I love that you can go back and review any exercise as many times as you want, to keep the information fresh.",Yes
I MAY be traveling to France in 2018 so I thought I would give this a shot. So far I really like it. I also like the fact that you hear audibles as well as see the phrases/sentences you are trying to learn. Nice APP!,Yes
"I loved Duolingo on line so thought I would use this for travel when I didn't have online access.  Not as good as I hoped.  Fortunately, most places I travelled in Europe there was WiFi and I was able to use the online version.",Yes
"I am already bilingual with Spanish, but I decided to try learning Portuguese.  Although it is similar to Spanish, it's an entirely different language and understanding one doesn't guarantee understanding the other. I'm still in the process of learning it, but I'm impressed with what I've learned so far.I've found the lessons to be thorough, and they involve learning what you hear and see written.  I haven't found rules of pronunciation but I'm beginning to make some inferences based on what I see when I hear it.I've also downloaded a Portuguese Bible and am using some flashcard apps to help.  But I'm finding that this app by itself is very adequate, and I'm enjoying using it very much.",Yes
"I really love this application. It's the first time that I feel like I'm truly understanding Spanish. I'm still a beginner, but it's helping my confidence in understanding the language and hopefully soon, speaking it. I recommend the app to anyone who is truly wanting to learn another language.",Yes
I like Duolingo. I'm using it to re-learn French. My only criticism is that the program makes me go back and redo lessons that I already successfully finished. At this rate I'll NEVER complete the program. My skill at understanding spoken and written French is much improved.,Yes
"My wife and I love this program. It is a series of top notch action stories and sub plots most of which take place in the coal mining area of eastern Kentucky.  As a matter of fact, after watching Justified it is very difficult to find anything else that satisfies us and holds our attention. Highly recommended!",Yes
"I took 4 years of Spanish in college and its really never able to truly speak it fluently. Since that experience, I thought that I was not able to learn languages. I am now learning to speak German and I am having so much fun with it but I have not put down my tablet for the past 3 days. It is very simple but it is also exciting and very fun. I cannot say enough positive things about this app for this experience I've had. The only thing I wish was different is that they offered more languages. I have always wanted to learn to speak Russian and Polish as that is what my family can speak.  the apps that are currently out there for those two languages are quite poor please add those two languages to this app and you will get many more people downloading it!",Yes
"I downloaded this after trying several other, free ""learn a foreign language"" apps.The others were so frustrating, I mentioned the problem to friends, and - thank heavens - someone recommended Duolingo.I was skeptical at first, but once I got into Duolingo's lessons, I realized they really do work. They're exactly what I needed.I'd learned French in school, many years ago. I haven't spoken French in over 10 years, and only now and then recall it when I'm watching a French film with subtitles, or watching a Poirot mystery where it helps to know what he's muttering in French.Now, with a neighbor who speaks no English and our own planned move abroad, I need to refresh my French language skills. I'm starting from a point of recognizing a few words and phrases, but I couldn't say more than ""Parlez vous..."" (""Do you speak..."") or ""Je m'appelle..."" (""My name is/I call myself..."").So, I'm starting French again, not quite from scratch... but close enough.Duolingo is perfect for me. It's fun. It's light. It's free (though there may be ads on it, according to some reviewers), and I quickly learned: Pay attention during the easy lessons, because a challenge may be ahead. You'll need to remember those words and spellings.So far, the only reason I'd pay for the Plus version is because I want to support Duolingo. I love it that they provide these great lessons in basic French, free to everyone.I'm giving this an enthusiastic five stars. It's a light, fun course that feels more like play than serious study. But it still produces great results and learning.",Yes
"My husband and I do a Spanish lesson a night, and we've found ourselves actually understanding each other! And to my surprise, I can write it now too, and can actually understand what my sister is texting me! Not all the words yet, but I'm not done with all lessons yet either.",Yes
"Very impressed with this app. The lessons are thoughtfully grouped and the different exercises cover reading, writing/spelling, and speaking. Awesome that there is a user community and discussion to help understand intricacies. Use it all the time! =)",Yes
The app is fun enough that you will use it. It's easy to test out of sections that you know. The app also has tolerance for slight misspellings. This free app compares favorably with the first Rosetta Stone unit.,Yes
"After hearing John Stossel talk about this app on his weekly TV show, I decided to buy it (free) from the Amazon App Store.  It is unbelievable.  I already speak some Spanish, but this app makes it so much easier to refine my understanding of it.  When you ""forget"" to study on a day, you get an e-mail reminder to do so.",Yes
Easy. It has some interaction which helps a lot,Yes
"This app is a great way to build vocabulary. You do need a basic understanding of language, masculine / feminine nouns and conjugation as these concepts are not actually explained.",Yes
"Fun, accurate and enjoyable.  Four university Spanish classes 16 years ago and I and my 3 kids are challenged and encouraged.",Yes
Oh my gosh I am not joking this is an epic app! It works! It truly does. I'm learning Italian on it and have not even been doing it for a week and I probably know  over 30 words. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn a new language. I find no flaws!  How it works:This game works by giving you different challenges if words. Sometimes it will say the words and you have type it back in English. Sometimes you have to choose the right English words for the phrase it is giving you. Another thing I just love is the voice that tells you the words is nice and clear. Also don't get too many wrong or you fail that lesson. You have a certain amount of hearts and if you exceed the amount of tries you fail. You can try again of course.STILL LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!,Yes
My oldest daughter challenged me to learn French using DuoLingo and so far I am having fun and learning.,Yes
I read the reviews before downloading the app and my honest thought was that people were over exaggerating how effective it was. After using it for three weeks now I can say it is awesome. I took Spanish 101 and 102 in high school and 101 in college and still did not learn and RETAIN as much as I have using this app every day. The lessons are repetitive enough to where you can keep reviewing but the different approaches of the same question keeps it from becoming tedious and predictive. Spanish is my husband's native tongue and he is impressed on how much I have learned in such short time.  Highly recommend the app.,Yes
Is helping me instantanly with dutch/german. A language that i thought would never thiught possible to be understood by my little brain. Fro. The beginning you learn a word in their dinaymics and aldo use repetition to help into my internalization. Is a great tool ro be free.,Yes
"Duolingo is currently offered to students of Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Irish, Russian, Turkish, Polish, Hungarian and Romanian. I have worked with Duolingo's French program on and off for several years, so I can say from experience that it just keeps getting better and better. There are a few bugs, particularly in the recorded words, phrases and sentences, but there is also the capacity to give feedback when something does not sound right, or when the program is too rigid in its interpretation of ""the"" correct answer. There is a lively discussion group  among students, and this helps to resolve misunderstandings when they arise, as well as serve as another feedback mechanism for the developers. There are passages in the students' target language to work on translating, which range from Wikipedia entries to novels, and here crowd-sourcing really comes into play, as the finished products are being prepared for upload to the web. If working with a language you have not studied previously, I find it can be helpful to have an introductory text to the language to consult, but even that is not necessary, as there are valuable supplementary materials to be found online (e.g., at the about dot com sites for each language.)I have recently been working with the German and Italian programs, and I am enjoying them as much as I do the French. These programs can definitely become addictive, but in the best way possible, as the learner sees her/himself making progress in reading, writing and speaking the language, even one which may have been studied for years. And I haven't even mentioned the fact that this fascinating program is free! And that it moves seamlessly between the computer, smart phone and Kindle Fire!  I am waiting, along with many others, for the long-promised unveiling of the Chinese program.",Yes
"The recommendation for this program was true- a robust language learning program with both visual and audio support.  I have been recommending it to everyone I know, including a Spanish teacher who thought it was fantastic!",Yes
"I expected something totally different.  I speak French and am trying to get some of it back, as I do not use it very often.  This is only showing me things that I already know.  My mistake for not understanding that this really is for beginners.",Yes
"I've always loved listening to foreign languages but didn't have much of a passion for Spanish, but I am amazed by German! I've always thought it was simply elegant, but I go to a private Catholic high school so German isn't offered. So I tried out all kinds of different apps and had made no progress and just about gave up hope. Then I tried Duolingo and it is so fun and easy and I feel like I'm making significant progress! My dreams of exploring the forests of Germany and the Alps of Austria can come true and maybe I could even attend a ball in Vienna! So don't give up hope! Try Duolingo!",Yes
"I think this app is great for people who want to begin learning any language. Of course it isn't capable of answering questions about grammar and other linguistic difference. But.can be used to get a head start if planning to take classes! It is well worth your time and I never thought learning Spanish would be this easy.P.s the kindle app (HDX) seems a little different than the iPad app, hope they take care of soon",Yes
"New to the app, but have found it very easy to use and a good basis for understanding the language.  Very pleased and will continue to learn.",Yes
"I really enjoy using Duolingo.. I have it on my kindle, my phone and I even occasionally use it on my computer.. n.n I wish they would add more languages then just the ones they have but oh well.. Little by little I am able to get a better comprehension of the languages (yes I am trying to learn several of them at once) and with Duolingo it is easier then sitting in a class.. n.n I encourage them to continue working with it, and maybe possibly adding some new languages soon? o.o Just a thought.. n.n",Yes
I don't know any Spanish and thought it would be nice to learn especially with it growing in the United States.  I work in a public service field and find it more and more necissary to learn.  This app is easy and fun- doesn't rush you through the lessons.,Yes
I've wanted to study German for years; but I could never afford the materials. Duolingo has made it possible for me to pursue something that I never thought I could accomplish. If learning another language is your dream this is the app for you!,Yes
"Wish I could have learned Spanish this way in high school. The game is easy to follow and makes learning and reading Spanish easier than the tradition ways that I had to use in school. Even though the program is easy to use, previous knowledge was/is helpful when using Duolingo.",Yes
"Based on Duolingo's rating system, I am an advanced Spanish-language learner. I got this free app hoping to brush up on my very rusty Spanish skills. For this purpose, I have been very grateful for the option to test out of each of the first three levels, and then to test out of each individual subject after that. I haven't yet reached a section test that I can't pass, but I've been studying Spanish ever since elementary school. Taking the tests provides a decent review, but I'm not sure it will help my conversational Spanish much.I certainly hope that the sections I haven't reached will cover the subjunctive as well as the future and conditional tenses. I haven't seen anything in the vosotros form either, so this may not be the best way to learn the Spanish spoken in Spain.  The vocabulary is very text-book style. There don't seem to be any words specific to a certain region or even any colloquial phrases included. I haven't seen any cultural notes, either. Those are not necessary for an introduction to the language, I suppose.It looks to me like the lessons begin very simply and build very gradually, so it would be an excellent choice for a beginner. I'm not sure yet how far it will take you into the more advanced grammar.  It probably doesn't help with conversational Spanish, but a person-to-person setting is the best for that anyway.I'm glad I've had the chance to try this out. I think I'll get a taste for French or German next!",Yes
"I've only just started using this app, but find it pretty good thus far.Seems like it teaches you the way you would learn a language organically, through trial and error correction.  I know, through past language study, that Duolingo is, through that trial and error process, teaching you how to use formal/familiar, male/female, singular/plural, and the like, constructions.  But, it's very subtle if you didn't have a clue about theses sort of things.That leads me to one of it's shortcomings, at least for me, and the reason the app is a 4 and not a 5.  Namely, it doesn't provide a whisper of explanation of these sorts of things.  It would be a great help, for me anyway, if the little message that pops up when you make an error gave an explanation.  For example, you have (no pun intended) tu, usted, vosotros, and ustedes, which all mean you.  Now in English there's just &#34;you,&#34; no (in order) singular informal/formal or plural informal/formal versions of you, though generally we figure that out through context.  So a simple, &#34;you used tu (the familiar),when you should have used usted (the formal)&#34;  would be helpful in my being able to separate the two in my head.  And, go a step further and give me an easy place to find that tells me when I should use one over the other.In the vein of more explanations, please; How about explaining (in an initial page?) what xp points are and how they are used.  Or the meter that goes around the microphone; is more better?  I tried really butchering a phrase and pretty much got the same reaction. If more is better, then I could aim for that.",Yes
"Great tool to increase your language studying, recommend to anyone who wants to challenge themselve.",Yes
I was going to buy Rosetta stone but my kids Spanish teacher told me to try this site and I am very glad I did.  I can use it on my computer or my kindle and it is amazing!  I find myself learning with minimal effort.  I feel challenged and find myself getting very involved.  Fun and educational can't beat that!  I stink at spelling so that is a bit challenging but the app adapts which is awesome!!  Gracias duolingo!,Yes
"I always thought French was difficult, with Duolingo I already know the basics ANSI's so easy to learn, interactive and fun., I strongly recommend Duolingo",Yes
"This is a handy app; don't let the kiddie mascot fool you.  No conjugating verbs.  With more or less a learn-as-you-go pace, feels like a game to pass the time.  Good interaction and feedback; uses multimedia effectively.  For a gritty person, seems to have enough levels such that he/she could conceivably become fluent.",Yes
"This app is great for learning the basics in different languages. It requires you to go back and review old lessons. you do have to look for explinations of the grammar rules, they are not forced on you. I love that it is completely free. you can buy things in the app but it is only with credits you get by learning with in the app and the things you buy only help you learn more. this is a well thought out app.",Yes
It is awesome and you really really should download this awesome app!! When I first heard French I thought it sounded a little like a language I would come up with so then someone said to download duolingo and when I did it was awesome!!,Yes
"This app is great especially for those w/ some understanding of languages, conjugating, and articles.  My 11 & 10 yr old love the app but have some problems with the ideas of articles and verb conjugations.  These ideas are not expressly covered. I love the app though.  It is really great for conversational Spanish.  You use visual, auditory, physical learning.",Yes
"I am enjoying the challenges on Duolingo! They assist with learning the language you choose to learn, as well as, spelling of the language. Learning both spelling and sound of the language spoken helps learning the language more easier. Enjoy!",Yes
It was so helpful earning languages is so fun and easy√∞???I never thought I could learn German so easily at age 11 they may not have every language but hey u can still learn a lot,Yes
"I have chosen to learn spanish. I have friends who speak it and I see the written Spanish language around me every day, so this is helpful.  The lessons are broken down into small chapters, so you can determine your own speed.  If you lose all the hearts during the lesson, it means you need to repeat it.  You can even go back to lessons you mastered in the past to refresh your comprehension.  Also, if you need help in understanding a concept, you can read the notes and comments from other students and assistants (??) regarding that specific drill.  I also like to listen to the speaker and repeat the phrases even when the app does not require me to speak.  I also like to try to understand thephrases before peeking at the hints.  A nice interactive app which I downloaded for free which is very valuable.  I don't know if it eventually want me to pay to go farther in the future, but I will see how far I can go. I recommend this to beginners, those who want to get some basics on these languages offered, and old students who need a refresher.  Eventually, I will also check out the German lessons to see how much I have retained from high school 30 years ago.",Yes
"Neat program, and if you have the time, can learn for hours.  It challenges you in various ways, which is good reinforcement.  Worth having, but wish it did not pester to play it each day.",Yes
This is the best foreign language app available!  Very interactive and educational while remaining entertaining.  I like the fact that it was created to translate all languages on line for free while offering education to users simultaneously. Created by the same guy that created Wikipedia after he got bored with retirement. I'm glad he thought of doing this because this app is the best!! Way more productive than crushing candy or browsing social media sites.,Yes
Great app. I think you still need to know a couple words already to get thru the app more easily. But of you don't know any words to start it will just be more of a challenge but still fun.,Yes
"I've been using Duolingo to improve my French.Over the years I've used a variety of language apps, podcasts, websites, books, and other resources to learn, or try to learn, a new language. Usually French or Cantonese. Duolingo is comprehensive in that it incorporates speaking, listening, and writing a language. My French had improved drastically just in the short time I've been using the app.The app addresses things that may seem minor, such as, allowing you to easily change your keyboard setting from English to French and back, and using the microphone to provide feedback on whether you are pronouncing things correctly. While I've found the microphone isn't always accurate, it's pretty good and definitely better than just speaking to an empty room with no feedback at all.I was disappointed that the app has so few languages available but I suspect this is what has allowed them to do so well with what they do offer. It also lacks instruction for people brand new to a language. While I had the benefit of having had some past instruction in the language, other people might find understanding the difference in sentence structures and how gender influences words, etc.Overall though I am very happy with it!",Yes
"Around 15 years ago, I took French and Italian for a year or so - just enough to get some basics down. Lack of use will erode any skill and Duolingo has helped me regain lost ground. I can't speak to the app's effectiveness for learning a new language but I've been very pleased with it as a practice tool and for expanding my vocabulary.On the development end, I am blown away. Changes seem to be well thought out and the app gets better with every update.",Yes
I love this app! I took two semesters of German a decade ago and so far I am remembering some of it. Nice to bring it back! Thanks for creating this app!,Yes
Amazing effective my daughter actually wanted to learn. This app is a game changer. What I thought was cool was the variety of languages you could learn. The only negative thing is you have to have WiFi to use this app. But I was so impressed with this app I give it five stars.,Yes
Easy to learn and helpful. Plus free! I use it as a mental exercise to keep my mind sharp. Learning a new language is a great way to stimulate brain and challenge yourself. App lets you know and sends you reminders to keep practising. It also gives you option to personalise your goals so you could realistic achievements for yourself. Definitely worth a try.,Yes
I'm multilingual and have been using this app to stay sharp. It's well thought out. I don't know how it well it works from a beginner's standpoint since I've studied all the languages offered.,Yes
I tried mango and I thought it was the best language learner but then my teacher told me about duolingo  and how I could earn extra credit and I still didn't try it and later on I try it and it's it's the most effective spanish app I recommend this for anyone learning spanish it really drills the spanish in your head,Yes
"This app gives you a great way to practice or review vocabulary and grammar in a variety of modes. I've been using it to review German, which I studied in college and haven't thought about in many years  and to try to learn Italian. For the latter, it's helpful to check out the Duolingo website and other reference materials to give you the grammar rules that you will practice. I guess this makes it sound dull, but I find myself firing it up at the end of a long day to unwind, just as others would with the more mindless games out there. This app is much better than the Duolingo app for the iPhone and is highly recommended over that.My only issue is that, very infrequently, the app hangs when it moves from one question to the next... but that is pretty minor.Well done!",Yes
"This is a great program, enough repetition to reinforce lessons but always adding a challenge.  Highly effective in increasing vocabulary.",Yes
"You've heard the saying, 'If you don't use it,  you lose it.' This is true for innumerable things, but never more so than in languages. This app helps me maintain my language proficiency, and if you know the process for language learning can jumpstart additional languages. I would recommend caution to those who have no experience whatsoever in languages though. Depending on the person's independent learning level this might not be the best introduction to languages.I would like to see more languages, including some that are more academic in nature; Classical Latin, Attic/ Classical Greek, Classical Hebrew or even modern Hebrew, and maybe some Arabic and/or Farsi.",Yes
"My husband is French and speaks French  to our kids at home, so I am exposed to a lot of verbal French. Duolingo uses sight, sound and writing drills to give you a solid understanding of vocab, spelling and pronunciation. I feel like I might actually learn a certain level of French and be able to speak with my in-laws one day - for better or worse :)",Yes
"Friends, who travel worldwide often, recommended Duolingo as a great communication preparation tool. I like being able to use this on my computer, phone, and tablet. For several years, I've wanted to learn a foreign language. Duolingo is helping me learn Spanish and sends reminders that I need to do daily lessons/practices. It teaches the basics and builds so that you move on from simple words to phrases and sentences. The forms you use are to listen/read and identify by speaking, typing, translating from Spanish to English and vice-versa. If there was a way to give it 4 and 1/2 stars, I would have. I didn't give it a 5 because punctuation and accents can't be used  a basic keyboard, so that's a challenge because it shows you are not correct when they're missing in what you type. At least it is not harsh about the errors. You can go back to review previous lessons, which is helpful if you've had  to skip a day or two.",Yes
"Choosing the right program for you is difficult enough, couple that with large sums of monetary investment and you got your self a high pressure situation.Duolingo is a program that recognizes your dilemma, and provides you a solution that does not sacrifice on quality. It offers a language learning program that competes with other for pay programs, and the best part is that it is free!Do not assume that because it is free it is lacking in quality. On the contrary, it is free because you will provide valuable work that will act as payment for allowing you access to this program. Your use of this program will help translate text of other languages. Not only are you learning a new language and expanding your world view, but you are also providing an invaluable service for the betterment of human culture.This is an application that needs to be in all devices.Give it a try, I'm sure you'll like it.",Yes
I'm so glad I d/l this app. it's the easiest way to learn a language! I love it! I'm encouraged enough to give it serious thought. Duolingo has made this app fun and challenging at the same time.  Thank you very much.,Yes
"Love, love this app! My Spanish speaking skills are limited to say the least. (Been a long time since high school. And no, you can't ask how many years!) So when my son told me about Duolingo, I was skeptical. But it is great! I am beginning to understand not only words, but grammar as well. (Although I am still struggling with plurals and pronouns!)Duolingo uses auditory, visual, and traditional methods of learning a language. There is some memorization but the lessons are integrated with hearing the words/sentences spoken, and pictures. You build on one lesson to the next. and if you fail to grasp the concepts, then OOPS! you have to start over. While my Spanish instructor friends may frown upon this ""shortcut"" method, it is providing me with the rudimentary skills to perhaps pursue a higher level of learning Espa√É¬±ola. I like that it is available for my phone, Kindle Fire or PC, so there's no excuse for not doing today's lesson. Now if I can just get those durn plurals and pronouns correct. Adios, mi amigos/amigas!",Yes
"This is my 11th language to start from 0 (unless I count the years of Latin). The structure makes a lot of sense and the pattern repetition keeps the salient grammar points fresh. Clearly a lot of thought went into continuous use and how cognition and mnemonics work. Highly recommend it. Wish there were a Chinese and Japanese module, hard to keep those fresh without practice",Yes
"I have such a low attention span for learning anything new that I never thought I'd get around to brushing up on my Italian or German. This app is great because it genuinely is very fun and rewarding, and you feel great about the progress you make. I've gone over some of my old lessons just to go for a perfect score :) . Would definitely recommend and I really hope they add Russian in future :)",Yes
"I like using it. I started using it on my iPhone and I thought my kindle screen would be better. They don't offer the same languages on each device so I just started over with Ukranian instead of Russian. I wish things were pronounced more but I just started so perhaps that will change. It's fun to use, I try to do the lessons more than once even if I ace it. I do not have the courage to say anything to anyone at this point but again, I'm just starting out. It's holding my interest and it's not dry like reading a workbook,or text book...and it's FREE can't beat it.",Yes
This app has been very helpful in my adventure to learn a new language - Spanish. It is a fun and user-friendly way to learn the basics. It teaches reading and oral comprehension as well as evaluating your spoken word. I really enjoy this!,Yes
"Stumbled upon this when looking for ways to learn a language online. Learning is set up like a game and you are rewarded for successful answers. This isn't the best method for everyone but I find that it is perfect for me. Much better than Rosetta Stone, the community here is friendly and answers questions and creates thought provoking discussions. You actually are learning the language, not just memorizing flashcards.",Yes
"Superior FREE app that really does help you learn a new language. Its really an app that is worth its weight in gold.The lessons are well thought out and you progress at a satisfying rate. It is never overbearing nor confusing. Its engaging and redundant in the right way. Retention is there!!!! I'm learning German, think Italian is around the corner. It makes even the hard languages fun to learn.This is for many other native speaking languages to learn English or some can learn French or other!What are you waiting for?  ""Du schaffst das"" or Sue Schaffen das ...German for you can do it",Yes
I love this app and recommend it to people I know almost daily. I feel that making an effort to learn a foreign language is respectful to the multicultural world we live in.  Duolingo makes it 100 times easier not only to begin learning a new language but also to practice second languages you may already know. The fact that it is accessible to nearly everyone with a tablet or smartphone makes this by far the best app I've ever downloaded.,Yes
This works for me where more traditional methods don't.  Get this if you really want to learn a new language.,Yes
"Duolingo is a great way to begin learning a new language. The native speaker is helpful with pronunciation, but I miss the grammar lesson of traditional language education. That said, the rapid pace is encouraging and the reviews help reenforce the lessons.",Yes
Absolutely love this app. I haven't studied Spanish in almost a decade and this app has me understanding more of the conversations going on around me enough that while I may not respond in Spanish yet I expect to be able to soon.,Yes
"I am a frequent user of duolingo and would recommend it to anyone. I have been taking Spanish for seven years now and school and am studying abroad this semester in Spain. I wanted to use this app to brush up on my Spanish but it has done so much more than that. It feels to me like I am taking an online course in Spaexnish. It is extraordinarily in-depth with its explanations and provides different tips and advice for remembering rules and vocab. Whenever you get a question wrong you can go into discussion forums where people have posted questions about the answer and I have always found in-depth explanations from other users on why the answer is the way it is. I have found few mistakes on Duolingo and I know they are constantly working to make it better. They are gaining new languages all the time and I will always use Duolingo to practice and keep up with my Spanish, even when I am in Spain this semester. Thank you so much, Duolingo!This app also is easy and works well, thought I was confused at first how to do accents. It is actually easier than on the web though! You simply hold down a letter and then swipe up to choose your different options. √Ç¬°Perfecto!",Yes
"I am using this app to learn Spanish, French, and German.  It has been very effective for learning both grammar and words.  The app makes learning a language more enjoyable than learning the traditional way.  If you use this app you will pick up speaking your chosen language in no time at all.  Highly recommend.",Yes
"I use this every time we are planning a trip, even to places I know. It helps me fine new restaurants and attractions. My GPS is good once we are on the road but this is great when I am in the planning stages.",Yes
"I have taken a few years of Spanish courses in high school and college, but I think this app has helped me more than any of them. The different methods for teaching the language (reading, listening, translating, dictating, etc), is what makes it so beneficial. I have always had a difficult time understanding spoken Spanish and this app is helping me overcome that problem.",Yes
Duo lingo is one of the most amazing language apps I have EVER tried! if you are even remotely considering this app GET IT. it took me minutes to learn a lot of words and phrases. Not tricking you I promise. This FREE thing helps me learn a language I never thought I could learn. Even if you screw up a little you still can figure out what you missed relatively easily. At a push of a few buttons you can try a new language. DO IT. P.S. I am a real person typing this,Yes
I love this app!!!! What a great challenge and it makes it more of a game than actually learning  very clever tool for learning a new language!!!!!,Yes
"I love Duolingo because when I wanted to learn French as a child, I thought it impossible. But now, I can freely explore duolingo and the French language, as well as many more languages. Thanks Duolingo! Or, Merci Duolingo!",Yes
"I studied French in high school and college years ago, and I've picked up a bit of Spanish here and there, and by reading some of the Bible in Spanish. I decided to pick up some German with Duolingo because I have a nephew who studied that. Well, that started out so well I decided to brush up my French and see what I could do with Spanish. Probably not a good idea to work on three languages at once, but I'm enjoying it and making progress. I was so rusty on French my attempt to test out of the Basics failed (just barely), but it's nice to know the option is there if you don't want to review from the beginning. Repetition is an important part of learning any language, but it can get boring. This program solves the problem by mixing up the styles of questions. It starts out very easy - some of the questions are as easy as tapping the picture of the word given in your native language with the target language below it. On some questions, you can tap the given word and see its translation, so you don't have to guess even if it is a new word (but guessing can be fun and doesn't ""hurt"" much!). Pay attention to the little words that go with them, though! In English (which is hard to learn in other ways) we just have ""the"" for everything, but in French and Spanish you have variations to match the gender and number of the objects (German has three singular forms, one being neuter, I guess). How do you know if an object takes a masculine (le or el) or feminine (la)? Practice, practice, practice! Take your time and think and memorize, and write words and combinations down. And Duolingo does let you go back and review skill sets. The instant feedback is much more enjoyable than doing written homework, but the German is making me want to get a textbook and do some extra studying! Some questions let you translate phrases or sentences by selecting from a choice of words, others let you listen to spoken words, phrases, or sentences and then select the words you hear. More challenging questions require you to type in the translation or words from memory. It even has voice recognition so some questions require you to repeat things in the target language. If it doesn't recognize what you say, it doesn't count it against you (lots of things can go wrong with voice recognition, such as background noises). If you can't get away from the noise or otherwise can't or don't want to use your microphone, you can turn off that feature and it will only give you the other kinds of questions. I've noticed that it also gives some leeway for typographical errors, although sometimes it's still counted typos as wrong and other times I've just been wrong but it was counted as a typo. It generally gets it right and the two kinds of errors balance out. I've typed in a translation when the task was to type out what was spoken in the foreign language, and it gave me a do-over. But watch out, if you make a mistake in your own language, it will count that wrong, too! English speakers had better know how to properly use ""to,"" ""too,"" and ""two,"" for example. Or maybe using DuoLingo will help you with that, too! Daily e-mail reminders (which can be turned off) help you to stick to it.[ADDED LATER] Well, I'm up to Level 5 in all three languages, and I'm definitely feeling the pinch of trying to make it QuadLingo. As I fail lessons, though, previous skills re-open to show where I need to go back and practice more, which is a good thing. It's exciting to be learning these languages, and I'm thinking I might dig through my collection of language texts to add to and aid my DuoLingo studies, since I've gone and set myself a three-pronged challenge. I wish I'd thought of taking notes earlier (I just added that bit with this edit); I'm sure that would be enough to make studying one language a cinch with DuoLingo.",Yes
"I have studied four languages in traditional class settings, and for practical use this app is much better.",Yes
"Not sure what would happen if this was the only tool I was using, but combines very well with my live classes.  Progression is logical and steady, but with enough challenge to prevent boredom.  Highly recommended, especially for the price.  One of the few free apps that is consistently excellent.",Yes
"I have used this app on my Kindle Fire to learn French, and review Spanish and German.  I also use the Duo website which has more features.  The app works very well.  I suggest that the user change the language setting on any handheld device to receive an even greater benefit in the learning experience.  For example, when I study Spanish, I change the language setting for the Kindle to Spanish.  It gives the correct keyboard, and it gives the correct spelling complete with the accent mark in the proper place.  It also gives a list of words directly below the input box, at least the Kindle Fire does this.  While the purist may consider this to be a cheat, I prefer to think that it enhances the learning experience.While there is very limited opportunity for in-depth listening comprehension with this app, there are plenty of free podcasts available in all of the languages that are contained within the app.  Also, it is helpful to have a good dictionary, either hard copy or digital.The Duolongo app has helped me learn basic French faster than I thought possible.  It seems like it would help beginners and intermediate level learners of any age, but would also be a great review for the more advanced learner.",Yes
"I had four years of college French- about 30 years ago, so I thought I would work my mind a bit and take a refresher.  This is a great tool as it is slowly coming back to me.  I am so thrilled that I am going to start Spanish next.  I highly recommend this for anyone needing a good language app.",Yes
This is the best app for learning new languages. It very challenging but helps you learn the meanings and gives you helpful hints. You can challenge your friends and even try to get the height score you can. Overall this app is a great use of energy and time. Download Doulingo. It will make you happy like it made me :),Yes
"I really love  this program. It lets me gradually work on different languages at a controlled pace. The selection has greatly expanded since the beginning, an  I suspect it will continue to do so.It should b  noted that this won't grant proficiency unto itself; it still takes effort to learn, and time spent reviewing, but Duolingo is great tool to make the process enjoyable.",Yes
"I LOVE duolingo!  I am over 50 and it's more difficult to memorize things. But I am actually learning easily.  It's fun to be challenged in several ways. It quizzes you on reading, writing, and speaking.",Yes
My two children and I are all using this app right now as an extracurricular activity for homeschool. We love it!!  I actually retained more from high school then I thought I had!,Yes
Duolingo is a great way to learn new languages.It is really easy to learn languages.I thought learning a new language would be a lot harder and Duolingo made it easy.Plus it is free.I absolutely recommend it.,Yes
"This app puts learning languages in an entirely new perspective. When I was in high school learning French I hated it, but duolingo has made it fun and exciting. It brings out my competitive side. Trying to make it through an entire round of questioning without losing any hearts really challenges you in to thinking hard about how you answer. I have already recommended it to several friends.",Yes
"Duolingo is very good refresher. True beginners should consider taking an instructor led course to better understand the use of the words (male/female uses of verbs, congugation, etc). Instructor led courses provide an enriched social  interaction with other students and timely corrections and explanations from the instructor.",Yes
I am learning French through school and thinking I could do with some extra practice. I hope to be passable at French in a few months and even thought it it's very structured and very accurate it is not intensive enough to become completely fluent.,Yes
"I have been using this app for a few months now, and at first glance, I thought it was fantastic, but I think that was because I was fervidly learning the German language because of my strong desire to do so, it is also because prior to starting Duolingo, I developed a partial understanding of the language through a variety of sources, to be honest, I don't think Duolingo is a good way to learn a language.One of the reasons being is that it was easy to understand as far as my previously developed understanding of the language, but when I was trying to learn new things in the language, it was difficult for me to learn regardless of my desire to learn the language, because Duolingo doesn't do much to teach you new things, all it does is tell you the definition of unknown words, and you have to rely on yourself to remember them.Another thing is that Duolingo doesn't teach the grammar of the language at all, and I know this because I understand that there are certain grammar rules in German that are different in English, I don't know exactly what those rules are, but I know they exist, and when I translate a sentence from English to German where the grammar rules apply, it is usually an incorrect translation, and I have no idea how to learn from my mistakes in this app, the only help you can get on this app is comments from other users of the app, which is only helpful sometimes.I think the only things this app can be used for is to get background information on subsequent education of the language, or to practice what you already know in the language. If your goal is to learn a language, this app shouldn't be used as your main source.",Yes
"nedee an app for my ds and i to learn spanish. This is a great app--lots of repetition, but in a variety of ways so you don't get bored. Also has a part where you speak the words so it can check your pronunciation. So far, so good. Only problem is that, one part asks you to translate a spoken word or phrase and you have to type it out. Sure hope you remembered how to SPELL that spanish word you just learned, otherwise, you get it wrong. This means, my ds can't be far from me when using this app because he has to constantly ask me how to spell things. Just be advised that the user would probably need to be third grade or older to use this independently. Otherwise, we like it.",Yes
"I have purchased a number of language software programs,  but this is the first one I have a really taken the time to use. Just wasn't motivated to be tied to the computer while learning or reviewing a language. This app is what I have needed all along. The ability to hear vocabulary words before choosing a final answer is great, though the pictures practically guide you to the correct answer.The lessons are short enough to fit into a tight schedule and at the same time, challenge you to remember previous lessons. I do like that the program reminds me about including accents and tildes, but I'm not sure how to add them. The good thing is the program doesn't take away points for not using accents and tildes. The bad part is I'm not sure I will remember which words require them.",Yes
for some reason this app really is enjoyable. it has just the right amount of challenge to feel as if progress is being made coupled with a useful amount of review.,Yes
"Really does help you learn a language with practice. It quizzes you to verify your understanding. It mostly asks you to select an answer without actually teaching you first -- so you guess a lot in the beginning. But that is not a bad thing. The process is engaging and ultimately inspires you to teach yourself without a physical teacher present. There are User Discussions associated with lessons, but I found myself doing additional Internet searches on certain words and phrases. The extra research significantly enhanced my understanding and helped me remember better.Also, there's a lot of fun to be had here. It offers multiple ways to learn (listening, speaking, writing and translating) which all serve to help you remember your new language. Plus, there is the ""gaming"" element that allows you to achieve points called ""lingots"" that can be traded for special learning modules. I gave this app 4 stars instead of 5 because it sometimes gave me ""credit"" for speaking the correct words when I had actually flubbed up the language. But for the most part, it was spot on!I actually have a paid subscription to a language learning site, but I find myself returning most often to this app.",Yes
"I am attempting to learn Spanish.  I am 67 years old, so this may take a while.  I thought Duolingo would an easy way to learn another language, until they threw in some Spanish grammar. It is not just conversational Spanish, but real life language.  Even if there is a  disagree with translations, a drop down box allows a message can be sent to disagree with the translation.  Just the other day, my translation to a sentence was added as another way to translate the statement.",Yes
"I'm learning German for an upcoming trip. I've tried several methods: Duolingo, books, audio books, CDs, and websites. I have acquired significantly more vocabulary and comprehension through Duolingo than any of the other methods. The interaction truly helps to solidify the learning. I also love that it is not static - it wants you to go back and review weak words periodically.",Yes
"I down loaded this app to brush up on my foreign language skills starting with French. I had 8 years of French, about 60 years ago. So I thought to skip the basics and start of with the phrases. However, I could not understand the teacher's French accent. Maybe because I learned French in Holland, even though I spent every summer for six years in southern Belgium and one summer in Paris. To make a long story short, I had to start with the basics to get used to the teacher's voice and accent. Now about the app. I am happy I downloaded it, and working rapidly through the lessons. It is a great program, but I am not sure if the microphone on my Kindle Fire HDX is working or not, when it asks for pronunciation of the phrases. I'll have to figure that out later. I will add to my review later on some more, after I finish all the lessons. I plan to brush up on German next, and will check out what other languages I can learn.",Yes
"I found this app in my search for a format to learn Portuguese when my daughter was serving a mission in Brazil.  It has been enjoyable to learn.  Hearing the pronunciation of words  and trying to translate is a challenge that helps me stay determined to progress.  It is helpful to know that there  are different  dialects in Brazil, and  having a resource (daughter) who is fluent in the  language is a bonus.  The most challenging part for me is speaking, since my tongue muscles are primed to English.  I have friends in Brazil who are fluent in English and I  Skype with them to practice.  I love this app!",Yes
Are you interested in learning a new language ? THEN GET THIS APP!! I've been during to learn one of my cultures which is Spanish . I also have been looking for apps that taught me but none of them worked ... then I checked out this app .I thought it wouldn't work because I didn't look it . So I tried it out and BOOM I loved it . If you are looking to learn a new language ... I would recommend this app !!!! :),Yes
"I love Duolingo. I'm doing four languages at once which is ridiculous but I am still retaining the info and learning more. There are so many ways to challenge yourself. You can chat with others and repeat lessons (which it prompts you to do). Even after you've completed a lesson the bars that show completion will go gray and you can go back and redo them. Also, once you have completed a lesson when you go back to practice more new words will come up that weren't on the first lesson. I think after you complete the entire course you should get some recognition and a transition into something more but it does nothing. That was disappointing. Still, I rate it highly and they are constantly making improvements and adding new things to make it even more fun.",Yes
I gave it a 4 because I would like more explanation to my error....errors. But I do love the app. I find myself understanding a lot more when I hear it.,Yes
"I got this app to give me something constructive to do while I recover from surgery. I figured it would be nice to learn some basic Spanish. I may not be able to say anything particularly useful yet (I've only had the app a few days), but I am having fun. Duolingo doesn't follow the conventional method of teaching He, She, We, They and verb forms. It jumps right in, and you are expected to pick up on the different forms as you go. You may be asked at the start of a lesson to translate something you have never seen before, which some people may find irritating. I find it a fun challenge to try to infer the meaning from the context. I do admit to asking my two teenagers (who are taking Spanish I)  for clarification on a few things, but for the most part it isn't difficult.",Yes
"I took Spanish in high school long ago. This game like format is fun and allows repeat practices easily, and good tests to help you evaluate your understanding. Come on!  What do you have to loose?FAST, FUN, FREE!!!",Yes
"I took quite a bit of Spanish in high school, but have forgotten most. I thought this was worth a try to refresh. I've not gotten very far, but it seems to have definite potential.  I like the variety of activities - I believe it enhances the learning experience and makes the lesson more memorable.",Yes
This is app is awesome and super easy to use! The organizational system as well as the reward system were really well thought out. I just wish I could ask questions about specific words or ways to use words.,Yes
"This is a fun, interactive way to learn a language and challenge yourself at the same time.  The owl and his rewards are addicting.",Yes
"I love this app. I have wanted to learn Spanish for 30 years now. I took in in both High School and College, but never really learned to speak it. I have tried a couple of other programs over the years, but for whatever reason, I just didn't stick to it . With Duolingo, learning is fun and doesn't seem so tedius, or overwhelming as I have felt with past efforts. I have stuck with Duolingo for a year now, and I can converse fairly well when we vacation in Mexico and with Spanish speakers here in the States.  I do two learning sessions per day, each one taking me less than 10 minutes. So, if you commit to just a few minutes a day, eventually you will be able to speak a new language. I plan on trying French next. I never would have thought  that I would some day speak three languages, but it is now within my reach.",Yes
"The entire family, 5 years thru 43 years, love and use almost daily this well thought out app. Very easy, builds gradually. And fun.",Yes
"I haven't completed the sessions but the first five were very good. It's essentially repetitive learning with the ability to go back and refresh as often as you need to. Some things aren't explained but if you pay attention you can intuit what you need to know. That's actually not a bad thing. The app speaks phrases for you to interpret and it does it at the speed a native speaker would use. This is very useful to me because I've been in non English speaking countries and thought I was prepared only to discover that I was only prepared if spoken to very slowly. Finally it also checks your own pronunciation periodically, another feature I really like.",Yes
this has totally helped me with my French class I'm understanding the words and they make it solo cute.I am totally recommending this to my friends Awesome App.,Yes
"In my job I come into contact with people from all over the world. I have been using DuoLingo for a few days and already my conjugation of common Spanish verbs has improved. The app certainly takes a non traditional path to teaching you a language but for me it seems to be working. Certainly worth a look - I know many of you will have learning a new language on your list of new years resolutions. Don't let this year pass you by! Download this app now and if you work hard, you may not sustain fluency but you should be able to get by.",Yes
I downloaded the app to keep up with my Spanish over the summer and it's really well developed and thought out. I never took Spanish I or Introductory Spanish so this is filling in the blanks I had been missing in Spanish II and III. I'm extremely grateful that this app doesn't needlessly repeat or baby its users. I don't feel stupid or irritated while learning at my own pace.,Yes
I'm in Spanish 2 at my school and thought it would be good for practice. I was surprised at how many basic words my teacher withheld from teaching me. I learned these words fairly quickly and found that I like this program better than the online program our school uses!,Yes
I love love love this app it gives me a chance to work on a different language as well as my traditional classes. It offers a large variety of languages and is easy to understand. My only complaint is that when gender matters you have no idea what gender it's supposed to be because it never tells you first.,Yes
Very good went to understanding lil to knowing more.I find this is more Latin American not castillian. some similar but very helpful,Yes
Getting much better understanding to speak read and write the language.. Excellent app.,Yes
"I've tried to learn different languages in the past, both by taking traditional classes and on my own with the aid of books and tapes.  This app was vastly more effective than either of those approaches, and a lot more fun as well.  Plus, the price can't be beat!My only misgiving was that it was all practice, no theory.  I would have liked to know *why* a particular verb form or case was the right one, so that I could draw connections on my own.",Yes
I take French and I could learn anything so someone suggested this app to me √É¬∞√Ç?√Ç?√Ç? and I use this app so much it's so much fun but I wish you could challenge my friends √É¬∞√Ç?√Ç?',Yes
"I may actually retain some of this !!!!!  best app I have.  gracias, duolingo for creating repetitive, fun ways to get Spanish in my head",Yes
"I have started learning Spanish using this app, which will be very useful in my nursing profession. I like how each new lesson builds on vocabulary and grammar from previous lessons, as a traditional classroom course would. I also started the French lessons, and although I took five years in high school, it has been a great refresher!Highly recommend for someone not looking for another mindless game!",Yes
"Actually, I find that I am enjoying using this app. Used it four or five times and now I can say ""Hola"" like a native. The repetitive nature of the app and what is said ensures that you'll finally get the lessons and is a real foundation builder. This app may be the easiest way to learn Spanish.",Yes
An awesome app. I truly appreciate the hard work that went into creating this app. You will not be disappointed.,Yes
"They only teach you a small fraction if the words other lessons offer, and in the segments where it says something and you have to type what us said...it's muddled and impossible to understand",Yes
This is such an easy and thorough product to use!  I've learned more Spanish in 2 days than I thought I could in a month!,Yes
"This app is great, especially since it was recently updated. The updates added a considerable number of languages, I wish there were more, but as it is, it's much more helpful than any other language course I have seen, if you use this app, and general internet, and or book research, I think you could do very well. If you speak english there are now 13 languages you can learn, they have courses for speakers of other languages, but I am not sure what they are.  The languages for English speakers are: (I believe from espania) Spanish, ( I belive Brazilian) Portuguese, Norwegian, Turkish, Danish, Swedish, Ukrainian, (Doitch) German, Dutch (from the Netherlands), Italian, French, Irish (commonly refured to by outsiders as Gaelic, the Celtic Language or old Irish (it is the second official language of Ireland, currently.)) And Esperanto (which is a constructed language for the purpose of globally understanding one another. It was designed to be easy to learn and is used in politics as well as being the official language of several places and the official second language in many places on earth.) This app is easy to use, has a nice interface, and, for me and many of my acquaintances, is very good for learning.  I would definitely recommend this.",Yes
I've picked up a better understanding of spanish in a few weeks playing with duolingo than in 2 years of high school Spanish.,Yes
"I'm actually learning Italian!  I love these lessons, and I love the interaction and the feedback.  What a brilliant idea!",Yes
I'm a new user and I'm using this app for only two days but it's really really cool. There's an awesome method which you'll learn grammar via examples and &#34;in-action&#34; without reading those boring grammar books and it's practices and some scores you give while studying make you remember everything it learns you. It's free and really ad free why don't you try it?,Yes
I came upon this app accidentally. Grandchildren were curious about the Spanish language and wanted to be able to communicate with some visitors. This app is great for inquisitive minds. They can pace themselves and enjoy the interaction of the app. They love it and are learning while playing. I'm thrilled! They didn't know its good for them.,Yes
"first of all its free. forever. it is effective but you have to hold yourself accountable to praftice and read the discussion forums for the answers in each exercise. also say the words out loud as you practice. helps cover translafion, speaking,  and understanding with a variety of exercises. It has a cool layout and the design is easy on the eyes.",Yes
"Thought It'd try it out and maybe entertain the dream of learning another language. I am well on my way. I can now read in my new language and make simple conversation. I try never to miss a day.This app works. I'm going all the way to the end. Vielen Danke, Duo Lingo! Ich sprechen Deutsche sehr gut!",Yes
The only thing missing is voice interaction.,Yes
I am blown away by how much spanish I know in just a few days!  I never thought I would learn to conjugate verbs and the different tenses ect. It's really so easy to learn this way.,Yes
"I am visiting Italy this fall and thought I would try and learn a lttle  bit of the lanuage. The aps good for a free app. It loaded and works well on an original Kindle Fire. The lessons are basic with,  but no theory about usage is given until you make an error. Then you need to remember the error vs being taught the correct use from the beginning. Otherwise a good basic free introduction to a language. Also it sends yours a daily reminder to keep you interested.",Yes
"Just downloaded this app.  Thought I would try the Irish learning section, the basics.  Was taught the words for man, woman, boy and girl.  Then I was asked to translate a four word sentence of which the only word I knew was man. The sentence was I am a man.  ????  Of course I was incorrect because I had not learned the words I, am and a.  Would not basic include these words?  Asking to translate what has not been taught?",Yes
"I have been using duolingo for almost a year now and I have seen amazing results! I have spent most of my time learning Irish. I traveled to Ireland this past summer and thanks to duolingo I was able to keep up a conversation with the native speakers and understand all of the signs without needing the English translation. It has also opened my mind to the world. I never thought I'd have an interest in Swedish, Turkish, or many other languages. I feel like I have received more than a free language education, I feel like it has broken barriers and brought the world to me.",Yes
"This app is fantastic! I've been using it for weeks now to learn Spanish. The controls are intuitive and I find it easy to learn a second language. I use this app on my laptop, my Kindle Fire, and my Android phone, and the app is great for that. It always keeps up on my progress, and I've had no issues at all. It's a great way to learn another language, and the best part is that it's 100% free. However, the one tiny issue that I have with this app is that you need to have speakers. This is fine when you're working on it at home, but in public places; not so much. It plays a word/phrase in whatever language you're learning, and you are supposed to type that word/phrase out. It's a bit awkward when one is in a quiet place (think waiting room at the doctor's office). You have to turn the volume way down and hold it up to your ear, or just wear headphones. This isn't a major issue, and all in all, I think that Duolingo is a fantastic app for people of all ages to learn an important life skill of being bilingual.",Yes
"At first, I thought this was not going to work. It felt a bit obvious. I mean, the pictures answered the questions so what was I learning exactly? But perhaps because it was so easy, I stuck it out and have actually come to understand a lot of Swedish. I am watching ScandiNoir tv-series and recognizing words and sentence structure. Of course, I am nowhere close to not needing subtitles, but I have the basics in a very short amount of time.  Of course, it helps that I have learned two other languages already, so my mind knows how to think about structure, etc. but still, this is painless.",Yes
I am really enjoying exploring a new language with Duolingo. The game format and audio/ visual reinforcementvare very effectve. I highly recommend it.,Yes
It challenges you mentally also.  It's a great way to learn a new language.  I love  this app!  Thank you Duolingo!,Yes
"My favourite application, it does wonders in learning languages. I've always wanted to learn German, and this is the best tool out their. I've also picked up some Norwegian, never thought I would, but it's s so addictive, in a good way.",Yes
I love this app. It uses various forms of reinforcement. I also appreciate the motivational emails that challenge/remind you to continue us!,Yes
"I never thought I could learn SO much from this app! It is amazing... I encourage you to get this app and use it, for many reasons: you learn a ton, it's fun, and it's easy to catch onto- get it!!!!!",Yes
I like this app however I think that you have to know a little spanish or language that you take before you start. I take spanish and I definitely thought that it was hard at the beginning.,Yes
"I love this app!!!  It does a fantastic job of guiding one through a language!  If you love to learn, and you don't mind a challenge, get this free app!!  You will learn so much!!!",Yes
I love this app for several reasons! I am curentlly planning to move to France/ Paris and thought I could learn French. It is awesome because it engages you. All other language learning apps sucked! LOVE THIS. MUST TRY.,Yes
"I would not recommend this app for anyone who doesn't already have a basic understanding of the language they're trying to learn. It does not teach you grammar, conjugation, or sentence structure, it only teaches you vocabulary and expects you to already know the rest. I took French in both High school and college, so I have a basic understanding. If I didn't have that, this app would be useless. If you're just trying to review or keep things fresh in your mind this app will work for you.",Yes
"Simple to use, fun, and after a couple of days I'm understanding French, a language that I have had little exposure to before!",Yes
"I can't think of a better way to teach yourself  a new language. The challenge of never missing a daily goal keeps my practice habit going everyday, and I find myself getting better and better at understanding the language. It's sometimes frustrating when my English translation is a slight variation of the ""right"" answer and the program says I'm wrong, but it is an amazing challenge to read, write, listen and speak in another language. And because of Duolingo, I am doing them all.",Yes
"I am actually learning French. Not memorizing it, learning. Thanks Duolingo. I never thought that I could.",Yes
Very easy to comprehend and a great refresher for those who know some spanish but need vocabulary practice. I also like that I can slow the playback down because I have always had difficulty understanding because those who are fluent speak extremely fast.,Yes
This app is easy to use and it keeps me on track. I never thought I would learn another language until I found this app. It makes learning another language fun.,Yes
Love the app. Always challenges me. I have way too many lingots though. I think the immersion articles are difficult. Even the easy ones. I like the option to just practice everything you have learned. It does not rush you and you can take as long as you want so long as you keep what you have learned up to date. :),Yes
"Great app, follows correct order to teach a language. Italian and Spanish languages are easy to learn. 100% satisfaction. Keep up the great work. √∞??¬è",Yes
"This app has been amazing. I never thought I would enjoy it so much or learn as quickly as I have. I am 59, and it's been years since I tried to learn a new language. When my daughter-in-law suggested that I give Duolingo a try, I must admit that I was skeptical.  However, I find the format and the content engaging - whether I choose a short practice session or a long one. I love the stats on how I am doing, and it really encourages me to hang in there. I have nothing negative to say about this app or my learning experience. I think this might be a first! √∞???",Yes
This app is easy to use and very intuitive. Has been a great way to work on Spanish I thought I had forgotten.,Yes
Very helpful in learning a new language. I thought it was cool how it expected you to figure out each individual word from pictures as well as using them in sentences. It felt more like a game than learnging. I would definitely recommend this app to others.,Yes
"I downloaded this because it came up when I searched ""learn Japanese"". A friend of mine is able to use the mobile version of this to learn Japanese so I thought my kindle could do the same. Unfortunately there was no Japanese to be learned on this app. (at the time of reviewing this 8/16/2017) It's a good thing I didn't spend any money on this because I deleted it less than five minutes after getting it.I am willing to change my rating if the app company adds a description as to what languages can be learned so people know before downloading.",Yes
I thought that this app was amazing! As a Spanish student already I found this app to be most helpful and it made learning Portuguese really easy for me. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn a new language.,Yes
"I got it for my 9 year old who has been begging me to teach her Spanish. So I thought why not get her this app and she can teach herself. It is easy,  fun and she loves it!",Yes
Love love love it!! Great refresher for my very rusty Italian!! Fun and educational! Who would have thought the 2 could coexist.,Yes
"Love it..... but need more classes, maybe some before 3pm?  That√¢??s a lot of wasted time lol hat classes could be going on!  Most moms can√¢??t start a class at that time as their kids are getting out of school. This part of the app won√¢??t be as successful as it could be since the times are so late in the day. Seems poorly thought out out.",Yes
I thought it was free but have to enter a credit card to watch during the free period so no thanks.,Yes
A great variety of recipes that provide tasty and healthy food for every taste bud.  Easy to use and a challenge to do something different.,Yes
A decent variety of menu items. A little heavy on the easy recipes. I'd like a bit more challenge.,Yes
I have only used it once but thought it was great.,Yes
I love the show with all the interaction of the chefs.  It is always interesting to watch and see what they have or have not planned as it happenes.,Yes
My fault.  Thought it would be more than recipes.,Yes
Impulse but at Christmas and I couldn't bevhappier.  Great variety.  I'm still exploring!,Yes
all the receipts are very tasty and delicious. I have tried to do some of them and made very nice surprise to the family. I would recommend to use this application. I would like to have Georgian traditional receipts also later :),Yes
"When I need inspiration, adventure, or something to make my regular meal production more enjoyble this us my go to app.  It is so much fun discovering recipes that get me moving.  Having some of my favorte Food Network chefs to draw from is a gift.  Like getting lots of new cookbooks to peruse.",Yes
"I really like this app so far.  I believe it could be even better if there was some way to display the ingredients beside the instructions.  I dislike having to scroll up and down to look at the amounts for ingredients as I try to follow the method.  I mainly use this app on my 8"" fire tablet, so this could be a challenge to achieve.  I love being able to include my own recipes and categorize them along with the recipes I save in my recipe box.",Yes
Don't watch as much as we thought we would.,Yes
I have been a food network fan since day one.  That may influence me a bit.  I was very happy to see this app.  I love having the ability to save recipes to my box on food network.  I like the way things are sorted. I am sure there will be some fine tuning to come but I am very happy with it now.,Yes
There are a few chef/cooks that are better than average on this program with different style of cook.  I find things on this site where other sites don't always give me such satisfaction in choices of recipes.,Yes
We all know how to cook but these chefs give us people more recipes with more ingredients to use. Some of these recipes I have made 2 or 3 times. Take a chance I'm sure u will love these recipes even more than u thought!,Yes
Works great! Show up fast. I am very happy with it I talk on the phone a lot and volume controls get real loud which I like.,Yes
I think that this app is amazing!!!! I love that I can have a recipe box and save recipes. I also like that I can look for recipes by my favouritefood network chefs. I also like the way that there are sections to help find food fast..... this is way less expensive then most cookbooks and a good inexpensive way to find recipes that will suit you and your family. The card box is much neater and faster than traditional card boxes.,Yes
"I agree about not having enough pictures to compare my own take on recipes, (I am a recipe addict), and love to cook.  I love to challenge my ability to plate pretty and go outside the box, it would help to have more VISUAL effects to compare to!",Yes
I like the concept of this app and was very excited about being able to look up recipes.  But this app worked about two times and froze.  I have not been able to get it to work since.  I downloaded onto a Kindle Fire and maybe it just wasn't as compatible as the app designer thought it would be.,Yes
This app has a well thought out format to some of the best Chefs available today.,Yes
It had everything it said it would have. I love the type if recipes it had on it even thought i haven't made any of them but I still love looking at it. JUST BECAUSE I LOVE FOOD.,Yes
"I loved the tv channel, so thought I would like this. I have it for my kindle, but when I try to use it, it only works for a short time, and then says that it has closed.",Yes
"Great to have this easy access in the kitchen. I never really thought about adding this kind of app, but now that I have it I love it! So quick and easy to search for your favourite recipes and I don't have to go back and fourth between pages trying to get parts of recipes to cook my dinners. So much easier than navigating a web page and loads much faster than your average internet pages. My bookmarks often get deleted by my family when someone tries to erase their internet history content, so bookmarking all my favourite recipes here ensures I don't lose them!",Yes
"Just when I thought I missed a recipe, I am comforted in knowing I have this great app accessible to my needs!",Yes
This app is so easy to use. I began exploring the very minute I downloaded it. I have several recipes ready for me to try from my favorite chefs right at my finger tips...,Yes
Not what I thought it was ....  could not access shows,Yes
"This app is pretty, has a TON of recipes, and is fun to use in the kitchen. At least, it was. As per usual, their last update screwed it all up. My recipe box-which now includes Kohl' s sponsored recipes that I didn't even choose-is a complete disaster. You select a recipe,and it pulls up another one entirely-every time. I have to look in my recipe box, then search the whole app for the specific title to be able to open it. Ridiculously annoying. This didn't start until 'Kohl' s' started choosing recipes for me. In addition, it crashes constantly and you cannot make folders within your recipe box, though it appears that you can. I have uninstalled and reinstalled hoping that would help. No such luck. I really hope they fix this app, because it was one of my favorites.",Yes
"Great site, can pull up just about everything, I am only disappointed that you took my favorite off and that is Paula Deen.  Shame on your over reaction.",Yes
This is a great app. I get tips from the stars and recipes I can use and the interaction within the app is awesome.,Yes
Great app that.  You  want to share with friends to influence trying of new things and maybe they will download themselves.,Yes
This is a great quick app for looking up recipes. Especially getting ideas you hadn't thought of.,Yes
"A useful app for those who wants to navigate away from the traditional printed cookbooks or recipe books.The only reason why this received 3 stars is because, at the time of this review, the login for the recipe box is non-existent. Error about &#34;... improving the log in process...&#34;If I am not logged in to my recipe box, then I have to search the recipes again that I saved.",Yes
If you like cooking and like exploring and tasting different cuisine.  This is the go to network. Learn from the best in their field and  elevate your repertoire of recipes to another level.,Yes
I didn't get access to any of the shows that I thought were automatically available. I can't use it. Too much work to get access. Going to cancel.,Yes
"At first I was really disappointed because I thought that all we were able to access was the previews. I hadn't realized you have to subscribe (and was disinclined to pay a subscription fee before I was able to try out the product) to unlock the videos. I finally clicked on the subscription box and discovered that you don't have to pay until the free subscription is up. Thus far, I have watched a couple of the classes and think they'll be very helpful (once I restock the pantry!). So far, so good.",Yes
I love the thought of seeing recipes from my favs but the app never works. It always forces close. I'm disappointed that I actually paid for this. I want my money back.,Yes
"I loved this when I bought it. It would have received five stars. Useful recipes, I liked the organization. However, after a couple times of exploring the app, it told me I had an invalid license because I didn't purchase the app. Obviously I did. I'm extremely disappointed. Not worth the two dollars as it stands right now.**Update:This app is NOT compatible with Android phones if bought it through Amazon. You have to buy it through the Play Store if you want it for your phone. Would have been helpful if Amazon restricted downloading like it does foe every other app.",Yes
I have been using this for awhile.  The recipes are easy to follow and my husband loves the food.  Not only can you save recipes that you like but it has a place to edit the food to your own specifications.  I have found my signature dish maybe you will find yours .  At the very least you end up with some special dishes.,Yes
"We are trying out Food Network Kitchen during the pandemic, and it's very informative.I do wish it had two things:Profiles for each family memberAndA way to select diet preferences for classes and recipes.(We are dairy-free and gluten-free due to severe food allergies. We are new to the dietary exclusions--our young son was recently diagnosed with Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EOE) after years of uncontrollable and chronic vomiting,therefore we are new to knowing which foods are substitutes for the allergy-foods.)We love food classes. No more fast-food for us! Healthy as much as we can!",Yes
"I downloaded this because I thought it was the watch Food Network app but it wasn't, so I just checked it out and I love it! √∞??¬Å",Yes
It wasn√¢??t the show I thought.,Yes
This app has a lot great recipes. My only complaint is that it has deleted some recipients I saved and I had trouble creating an account.,Yes
Very helpful in choosing the right recipe to use.,Yes
Like it very much. It's a great inspiration for creating meals when I feel most uninspired to do so!,Yes
I LOVE cooking along with my favorite chefs LIVE and having a wide variety of recipes at my fingertips. I highly recommend this culinary adventure.,Yes
I keep seeing advertisers for this app so I thought I would check it out and it just another app that wants monthly fees,Yes
I like the app (there is so much food to cook and so little time!) but had the hardest time in finding it on my tablet after downloading it. I thought the name would be &#34;Food Network&#34; or something like that.  I hunted all over the place to find the app so I could put it in my Learning folder.  After ages I found it named as &#34;In the Kitchen.&#34;  Just a heads-up for you all!,Yes
It's not what I thought,Yes
I am very happy with this site! Easy to use and lots of usable ideas. The only detraction is that Emeral is not listed in with the chefs!,Yes
"Overall this is a great app. I'm not one who enjoys to cook, I basically cook to provide sustenance for my family.  This app makes my life easier and cooking more enjoyable for me! It's nice to find recipes that fit into our keto/low carb lifestyle.  Recipes range from ""fancy and involved "" to ""quick, easy, simple "" . I love the ability to follow the recipe in a traditional manner,  have it ""read"" to me, and to be able to watch it being made. Bonus....my family has liked everything that we have tried so far.With that being said...I only have one complaint so far. If I have watched a recipe being made and it has ended, it won't allow me to click back on to the recipe from my list of recipes.  I have to go back to ""home"" and then back to my recipes for it to work.  Besides that,  I have to say that I love the app!",Yes
"Got a free year w my fire stick and it's okay. I like the cooking bake offs, and challenges. Many seasons and shows for both catagories. I wouldn't pay for it tho, tbh.",Yes
I did not realize this as a monthly subscription. I thought it was an app to watch shows from the Food Network.,Yes
Not what I thought. I deleted the app,Yes
"Shame on you Food Network. If for no other reason, because Paula made you people a lot of money she should have been here. Her personal life doesn't change her talent nor is it a reason for you, who should have stood by her in her hour of need, to eliminate her from this app.Not only that but the case was thrown out of court as the person who sued her is white, wasn't discriminated against and had no real proof. The entire lawsuit was bogus. IMHO, an attention seeking grab by the person who sued her.Everyone makes mistakes and has to live with the consequences and I'm not saying Paula handled the whole thing well but I think she was kind of in shock and just reacted. Remember, she was agoraphobic at one time and her emotional reaction is typical of that type of disorder.Again, shame. I'll not watch Food Network again, buy any of it's merchandise or have anything to do with any chef affiliated with them. Doing what's right should never be an issue.",Yes
Did not use thought was free app,Yes
"I love the diversity in the recipes, there's absolutely lots of somethings here for everyone. It's been a blessing since we have so many different types of eaters in my family. Being able to see the live classes during and after has been so awesome. It's great to get to see it live, but for the not so experienced cook like myself, it's good to see it in action with the ability to pause and catch up. This app has most definitely nurtured my relatively newfound love of cooking, and I couldn't be happier with it.On the technical side, it has worked great, no problems, and I have zero complaints.",Yes
Love all the new recipes I tried and all the ones I want to try. Love that I can save them to try later.  Have tried a few of the the tutorials and thought they were very informative. Enjoyed. This is a great app for every level of cook or want to be cook.,Yes
"It's a great app, the only complaint I would have is that the video's tend to freeze and start over again. I thought it was my wifi connection but everything else runs great on my kindle.Needless to say I do like the app, I can keep the recipes I like & have a shopping list.",Yes
Just watched the judge challenge and wa greatly disappointed as to why the judges win.  You need to incourage the contenstents as they have such a disadvantage competing with judges that already have history with the judges. Let√¢??s get honest and give up the good oh buy network nd give some of these new chefs the due they deserve.,Yes
"Better than I thought. I like the fact that it shows you pictures of the chef, then you click them to get their recipes. There is a lot of recipes, but not overwhelming.",Yes
"I have to admit,  in the beginning I thought the Food Network was a crazy idea. Now its one of my favorite channels. I will continue watching to keep up on the latest and the avant-guard in the culinary arts.",Yes
more of a novelty for me,Yes
"I love this app!  It's perfect to store all of my recipes in one place.  It's such a chore to go from one website, blog, online recipe file to find the recipe you want.  Sadly I came across some of my old 'saves' to find the recipe has been deleted or the blog is gone.  This app keeps those recipes in ONE place along with my collection of pins from Pinterest.com. No more worries of loosing the recipes.A great feature of this app is that you can access the recipes offline.  This helps when you are at the grocery store to pick up the ingredients you need and there is no wi-fi.The larger Pictures and Grid View are a nice improvement.  I like having pictures for my recipes and being able to add pictures is a bonus.The added tag feature makes it even easier to find specific recipes without having to scroll through the hundreds of recipes I've saved.  (I'm actually over a thousand now:))The ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 Stars is that I can't use this app on my desktop or laptop (and currently not my Blackberry.  The app is only for Android devices).  I'd like to be able to add/edit recipes from there as I've been saving them in my bookmarks lists.  I ultimately emailed the recipes links to my email account and clicked the links from my kindle. I do understand from the Chef Tap website that this along with a cloud feature are two of the things they are working on.  Good.  I'll give you the fifth star when it happens :)  It'll be nice to share one recipe file across devices.  I've been due for a phone upgrade for awhile but I'd put it off waiting for the latest to come out.  The latest features on the new phones are great but since using Chef Tap along with a few other great apps from the Amazon App store I decided to upgrade to an Android phone instead of upgrading my Blackberry (kinda a tough thing since I've had a Blackberry for 10 years at least.)To save the backup file to my desktop I had to go through Dropbox because the app said the file was too big to send via email. This isn't really difficult so I don't count it against them.  I now use Dropbox for other things like sending my personal videos, pictures and other downloads to my desktop when I need more room :)  If you don't have a Dropbox account or don't want one you can manually save by connecting your device to your computer and saving the file that way.  The Faq page on Chef Tap has details.I recently saw from their FAQ page a way to transfer files from .txt .  This is an awesome idea I haven't yet tried.  But I will because I want to add my grandmother's recipe file.  Those are actually in a REAL recipe box on REAL recipe cards.  But that will be a project for another day.The Chef Tap FAQ page and Facebook page have lots of answers to help as well as being user friendly.  A really nice change from an app creating team:) They plan on adding new features and keep you up to date in a newsletter and on their facebook page and blog.  Looking forward to having the shopping list feature.Like I said earlier it's a GREAT app!  I don't mind the ads and usually don't but will pay for the ad-free just because the app itself is worth the money.",Yes
"I have hundreds of cookbooks however Chef Tap is  a valuable app that  allows me to save recipes as they are shown from my web searches. I enjoy exploring advanced cooking techniques and being able to save recipes with the original formatting and illustrations allows me to save them. This is easy with the free app but I like the app so much that I have upgraded to the paid version to get the additional functionality. I use my Fire in the kitchen while I am cooking and follow the instructions for the technique and use the pictures to expertly ""plate ""the food as shown in the original recipe. I am currently exploring ""sous vide"" techniques with the Joule immersion circulator and there are an increasing number of recipes online for this method.",Yes
"I really like this APP.  Very addictive.  A couple of weeks after I loaded the free version, I ordered the premium package√¢??to be honest, I think they wore me down with all their requests to order the premium package.Admittedly, there were many times within the first 2 weeks that I almost deleted this APP.  I would get very frustrated because I found it difficult to use.  It seemed that I could never find the specific instructions I needed.  I√¢??m not very computer literate.  I would finally figure it out and see how simple the procedure was.  A couple of procedures I did not find for months, and then only by accident.  Made me crazy when I discovered how simple the procedures were; showed me how little basic computer knowledge I have.One other problem I find is that frequently Ingredients and/or Directions will be missing or mixed in under the wrong category (i.e., Ingredients mixed in with Directions, or vice versa).  RECIPES MUST BE CHECKED for missing Ingredients and Directions.Now, I love pulling up recipes to try.  And I find a new, to me, helpful APP procedure almost every day.  In fact, I have to watch myself.  For someone who is a lousy cook, I find that I am very addicted to the APP and can spend hours on the APP choosing recipes√¢??if I allow myself.I have gone on a special gut/tummy healing diet called Specific Carbohydrate Diet.  I had never heard of this diet before (also suppose to be helpful for autistic children).  So I was surprised when this APP pulled up so many great recipes and websites.I would consider this one of the best purchases I made this last year.  Certainly one of the most enjoyable and useful.",Yes
"I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE this  app!  I don't have a Kindle, just a cheap run of the mill android tablet and this app works well on it.  It is simple to use (most of the time, some websites have weird configurations),  but most of the time it's great.  The only thing lacking imo is the ability to categorize the recipes,  such as  creating folders for breads,  desserts,  beverages etc.  Worth paying for with that option added. Maybe sometime soon?  Anyway,  great job guys.  My now favorite go to cookbook  app.",Yes
"You can see my original review below this update.: what was once 4-5 star app has become a 2 star due to the change over to VERY expensive paid subscription if you want to have more than 100 recipes stored. Eleven to twelve dollars a year is ridiculous, I understand they need to make some money to be able to continue to improve and support this app but the cost is prohibitive to what this app does and I refuse to pay them their current fee just to store and import recipes from the internet. And I do not buy their excuse that there is no way they can afford to keep this app running without such a high cost. They do not need servers to store all our recipes, those get stored on our devices and do not cost them a dime. Yes they want to be able to fix bugs and make improvements but please do not insult my intelligence by saying they cannot afford to do it without having everyone shell out for their price. I have far more sophisticated apps on my devices that were free. Yes many of them are supported by larger companies but this program does not require as much tinkering at say a spreadsheet or WORD document writing apps. I might consider an annual fee that actually was fair(at least a 50% cut on their current fee would be smart.) but until that time I won't be upgrading and will just go back to how I used to do it with Pintrest.To sum up; in my opinion while this is a very nice app but it is not worth the price tag they set to upgrade to the ""pro"" version.Original 4 star review:I love this app it works very smoothly 80% of the time...I downloaded all my saved Pintrest recipes with very little corrections needed and adding new stuff is a snap. Where it loses a star is downloading from personal blogs like Blogger etc..I had to pretty much retype most of each recipe myself. Now some of this is probably due to the nature of my blog which has a lot of non recipe storytelling stuff mixed into my entries. But what bothered me was the random stuff this app did not load at all. I would rather it loaded my entire blog letting me delete what I did not want than for it to pick and choose what it wanted to collect.",Yes
I love this app and the fast interaction to view and save recipes. The reviews and suggestions from other users is awesome and raises the usefulness to a high level above other apps. It is useful to surf for dinner ideas when you need a nudge to be creative.,Yes
"Chef Tap is amazing!  If you browse recipes on the internet, you must have Chef Tap.  I enjoy the app Zite and often want to keep recipes from there and it is as simple as pressing ""share"" option and choosing Chef Tap.  The recipe is entered into ChefTap complete with photo. I have chosen to have the upgraded version that has an annual fee. It is better than a cooking magazine subscription, because every recipe is one that I have chosen. Money well spent!  Every time I bring another recipe into Chef Tap, I say, ""I love this app!""",Yes
"I have amassed quite a collection of recipes on my kindle fire.  The problem was I had them on several different apps, and a ton of bookmarks and saved blogs.  ChefTap enabled me to have all my recipes in one place.  they have thought of everything I might need, and for what they haven't thought of yet, they regularly update.  Awesome job!",Yes
"i think this is the best app on my kindle fire. Recipes are quick and easy to import, and changing or editing them is equally easy. only one weird thing has happened-- when i imported a recipe from a text file on my laptop, it didn't correctly import the fractions. it was easily corrected and only took a minute.I do wish there was cloud storage or a pc version,  though. If something were to go wonky with my fire, it would be tough to get all this info back.Update: There is now both cloud storage and a pc version making it very easy to import recipes on my laptop. Paste the URL and the recipe is added to my kindle. All the recipes also can be accessed through my computer. I did upgrade to the premium version, so this may not be the case with the free version.",Yes
I love this app it is my only go to recipe app and was probably the fourth one I found being unhappy with all the others. its easy to share right from the web controls are spot on and just an all around great app so get it I am sure you wont be disappointed,Yes
"Only used it minimally, just for importing from the web. love it for searching for a recipe, importing to cheftap, then using my kindle fire to follow the recipe in creating dinner. I can see loads of potential for growth.",Yes
"When I saw that this app was free, I tried it. I was very impressed. Its a brilliant app. I got recipes from foodnetwork.com, bbc food etc. Its quiet easy to use and very user friend. Then one day a message said upgrade to Cheftap Pro. I thought no problem, it turned out the upgrade was for $11 and you pay it every year. Outrageous but true. Once of payment would be enough, bought from my amazon.com appstore. I find it very hard  to trust with personal data. At moment I prefer amazon.com for all my buying. Had enough.",Yes
"I just downloaded this app & I'm already in love with all I've seen. Few of the recipes weren't what I wanted yet close. Either way I found 5 recipes for what I want to cook. Yet find there are still more to go thru! I'm ready now to get started with grocery list, recipes and find out my next action I feel I need to do Alot yet ok due to everything has to b in a certain place ! Enjoy like I am!",Yes
"The way the app functions is amazing but now upgrades are required if I want to add more recipes.  I don't want to put my recipes on your server.  I liked having what I want , where I want it and under my control.  I had that until this last change.",Yes
"I'm 15 years old with a passion of cooking. When I found this app, I thought, ""I'll give it a shot,"" because I'm great at cooking but not great at remembering. And I absolutely love this app! It's so easy to save recipes. I love it and so do the stomachs of the people I feed (:",Yes
"This app is simple to use and has excellent functionality.  It's perfect for collecting all those fantastic-looking recipes you find online.  Just share the page to the app and it ""reads"" to find the ingredients and instructions then imports them to the app where your can access them offline.  There's a editing feature if the app misreads a recipe.  You can set up your own categories to organize your collection.  It's well-made and thoughtfully designed.  It has been working nearly flawlessly and I recommend it highly without reservation.",Yes
Not what I thought is was. :(,Yes
"I usually get annoyed with changes, but this update is great!  I now will be using this to store all my recipes from the web.  I like the drop box backup--- this app is AMAZING!!! Thank you for such a well thought out app.",Yes
I just wanted to put my 5 stars in. I love love love this app! I am so glad I found it because I have recipes saved all over the Internet. Now I can put them all in one place so easily. Whoever thought of this app is genius.,Yes
"The customer service is horrible.  At first I thought the customer service was horrible, because I was not a paying customer.  So I decided to pay for a year to test out the product.  My youngest son wants to be a chef when he grows up, so I really wanted a great recipe tool.  So I paid my money, and reported the software bugs to the developer.  The programmer's bug fix completed trashed my database.  Images on my tablet were deleted, and all changes that I did to recipes on my tablet were erased.  I import recipes and then modify all of them to suit my family's needs.  Anyway, the programmer's response when I told him my database was trashed was to give me my money back (which I did not ask for), and to downgrade my account from a pro version (which I legitimately paid for) to a basic version (again, which I did not ask for).  Yes, once my database was trashed, I knew that I would never renew the subscription to this product.  But now I have to do it before I hit 100 recipes instead of having a year to find the right product.This product have too many bugs that can serious damage your database of recipes.  It is not worth the price, especially when the programmer wants you have to have a 20 year relationship with his product.  Over 10 years, that is $156.  Over 20 years, it is over $300 for a simple database to store recipes.  After you reach 100 recipes in the database, you have to pay a yearly subscription fee of $15.99/year.  That is $156.00 over 10 years and over $300 over 20 years.The only software that I re-buy each year is tax software.  Everything else I pay for with a one-time fee, and I will upgrade when I believe that I need to upgrade.  If I need to synch my database on a cloud, I will do it on my own cloud.  I don't need or want to pay a yearly fee for each type of data I may want to back up on a cloud.I believe that programmers should get paid for software they develop, which is why when there is a paid version and a free version of a product for a tablet, I usually buy the paid version.  Plus, I don't want my kids exposed to ads.  But subscription software?  The product has to be a the best of the best, no stone unturned, you can't live without, level of product.  This product does not fill those requirements.",Yes
"I had this on my DroidX2 and it's awesome. It can import recipes from anywhere, including photos, and gives you full control to edit everything. You can even put your own photos on the recipes. Now works with Kindle Fire which is even better to use while cooking. Give it a try, you will love it. Best recipe app in the known universe.",Yes
"CMsecurity shows Spybubble in updated version during the install from Amazon.May be false positive, but I do not have the expertise to be sure.  I immediately uninstalled this app. Dev needs to be notified.April 14, 2015",Yes
hard to use.  thier is no reciepts in this app you have to down load .  I thought this would give me recipts so that i would not have to down load.  I diffently would not recommed,Yes
"so sorry but I thought this sucked, I was unable to use it and it was a waste of time and money for me",Yes
I love this app!! I've had no problem uploading recipes or creating my own. This is a must for anyone who loves to collect recipes. I've tried so many other recipe apps and this is by far the best!!,Yes
"This app seemed okay at first. It even gave me a free trial to see how I liked it. And initially, it did what I needed. Or so I thought. The √¢??free trial√¢?¬ù is actually only about five minutes long, which wasn√¢??t enough time to test the sound. (I am actually not clear whether you CAN test the sound in the trial, because that√¢??s how quickly it went by.) So I foolishly paid the $9.99 for the full version. Did the sound work then? I√¢??ll never know! Because once I input the activation code, I could no longer get the screen to even mirror. Just the same error over and over again. So I gave up, removed the apps from my laptop and TV, and I would basically like to forget this ever happened. Do not waste your time or money on this.",Yes
At first I thought I was too stupid or too rushed to get this app to work but then I read the reviews and saw that most others could not get it to work either. I will delete this app.,Yes
"This app is very glitchy and laggy when mirroring a computer on the same network, the mirror file feature works, but if you pause the video from your remote control you have to restart it from the computer you're using to mirror. I would have been better off spending the 10 dollars for the license key on a cable to just plug my computer into the tv.",Yes
"Installed on Amazon Firestick with no problem.  However, my iPhone 6s would not connect to it.  The picture on my TV would only give the AirBeamTV logo and would not allow me to use my controller for the Firestick.  Each time I would have to remove the power cord and the Firestick itself to clear the screen and plug it back together to get back control of my Amazon prime video.  After 3 attempts I deleted the app and called it a waste of time.",Yes
"If you're looking to seamlessly mirror content from other devices to your TV to follow along exercise/dance videos, learn a new skill, or enjoy general entertainment on the big screen...this product isn't for you.However, if you would like to be constantly dissatisfied or disappointed, you've come to the right place! Enjoy the frequent buffering and frame skipping of an inferior product that will never be mentioned in the same breath of a ChromeCast, Apple TV, or Firestick. But who values reliability and quality anyways? Being constant is dull. AirBeam TV keeps things FRESH by spontaneously throwing in wrenches into your streamed content. This app will take your favorite videos and movies, and mindlessly chop-and-screw it until it devolves into a hot/disheveled mess that once resembled your original content. But hey, everyone loves a good remix. Remixes are awesome and always better than the original!And if you enjoy horrible customer service, you can always count on AirBeam TV to not be there for you. If you had questions or comments about the product, but are repulsed by the thought of talking to a human being, AirBeam TV will gladly send you through an infinite loop of automated responses while deferring all blame to the user. It's not enough that I've restarted my computer and modem, closed all other extensions/applications, and checked the internet connection of my TV...I probably need to give up my left kidney and bladder too for my video content to be streamed without a hitch.AirBeam TV's connectivity strength and resolution may be inconsistent, but your disappointment with the product will remain constant over time!",Yes
It√¢??s free and that√¢??s about the only thing I can say but for me it didn√¢??t do what I thought it was going to do,Yes
It took longer to start streaming than we thought but we were able to watch our grandson play in his college football game.  Yea,Yes
"It shows ads that require a controller to close and unfortunately couldn√¢??t control it to close them, and had to restart my stream and the airplay",Yes
It sucks. It makes you watch videos to get five mins of airplay. Not what I thought it was going to be.,Yes
"It does the thing! With this installed on my fire stick, I can use AirPlay to play the videos in my Files app. I have actually been using the VLC app since it√¢??s easier to find airplay on it but that app requires that you also select the cast option in order to stream the video and not just audio which is weird but I super don√¢??t care because I√¢??ve been trying so hard just to find something to get my videos from iPad to tv. Others have mentioned ads, and I can√¢??t say whether they disrupt content yet; I√¢??ve only seen them between actions (from playback to stopped, etc) and there√¢??s an √¢??x√¢?¬ù button on all the ones I√¢??ve seen immediately so they√¢??re easy to bypass. So for me, good enough!",Yes
"March 3, 2020I was looking for an app that would allow me to display photos/home videos etc. from my iPhone & iPad to a non-smartTV via my Amazon FireStick.  This app supposedly does that using the Apple AirPlay protocol built in to the newest Apple mobile devices.  I downloaded the AirScreen app onto the FireStick from the Amazon website and installed it on the FireStick according to the instructions.  According to the pre-loaded tutorial video bundled with the app, I should then have been able to go to any iOS mobile device with AirPlay enabled and from the ControlCenter, scan for other Airplay compatible device connected to the same WiFi network (which the FireStick was) and select that device and begin mirroring.  Unfortunately the app was unable to detect either my iPhone or my iPad although both had AirPlay enabled and both were connected to the same WiFi network.I then called Amazon Tech Support and spent about an hour on the line with them while they logged in to remotely view my FireStick screen and operate it remotely.  The were unable to solve the issue so the called Apple Support, making it a 3-Way conference call.  The Apple support rep remotely logged on to my iPad and operated it remotely.  Again, no one was able to make the iPad connect with the FireStick.  Since I had already tried and had the same problem with an AirPLay enabled iPhone also, it seemed unlikely to me and to the Apple rep that both iOS devices were malfunctioning but rather that it was either the FireStick and/or the app itself that was the problem.  The Apple rep came to the same conclusion, so she departed from the conference call.The Amazon rep remained on the line and we did some further checks to determine if there were any other problems with the FireStick itself, which there were not.  Every other non-AirScreen related function of the FireStick appeared to be working normally so we all concluded that there must be a problem with the app itself.I had downloaded the free/demo version of the app, which claims to function fully without upgrading to the paid version, but with advertising pop-ups.  I was not going to pay to upgrade until i saw the app work as advertised, which had it done so, I would then have paid to upgrade to the ad-free version.  Accordingly I do not know if the upgraded version would have worked properly or not.In short, this app does not do what it claims to do and therefore should be considered useless for the purpose of mirroring an iOS device to a FireTV device.",Yes
"Thought it was a method to view other movies, it is not nor does it show what can be done with it. A waste of time and money.",Yes
"Just bought this app and at first, it seemed to work fine but then I began to Chrome Cast from my national (Danish) tv apps and it failed totally. I also tried to Airplay and for some things it works but not for all. So Netflix works, but that's on my Fire stick. Viaplay and HBO Nordic just did not show anything. In my book, if you write a function it has to work 100%.I have Chrome Casts at home. I bought the Firestick to have a better solution when traveling. Chrome Cast is not good at hotel wifi. I thought this was the solution....",Yes
"I decided to use this app because the yoga app I'm using doesn't work on my fire stick but it works on my ipad, I was able to stream a couple of times for free although there was a serious lag the last couple of times. I thought that this was maybe because I needed to purchase the app. It kept trying to load advertisements but it wasn't able to do it on my fire stick so I signed up for the free trial and now it's not casting at all. It's just a blank screen on my TV.. cancelling the subscription. Doesn't work.",Yes
"I thought I would be able to cast like a chrome cast from my iPhone. It does screen mirroring however, when I try to cast a program from my phone it plays only audio not video. And it only plays audio for 10 seconds and shut down with an error.",Yes
Poor and unpredictable cast quality when I used it to cast from browser to fire tv.Annoying ads got me frustrated and I am usually quite understanding of ads.,Yes
"I at first thought that this was malware, but after looking into it I believe it just is a horrible piece of software.",Yes
"After my initial excitement that it was easy to use and install, I immediately deleted it when the popup ads disabled the screen cast.",Yes
"I have no reasonable input.This product really does its thing well! It gets the job done and it makes good on its word.Maybe.Or, maybe not.My daughter downloaded this..I have had zero interactions with it,other than writing this review,which I felt compelled to write.",Yes
I was hoping it would do more than just display my laptop screen on the tv monitor.Was hoping the amazon remote control would be able to do basic things like PLAY/PAUSE etcBut it√¢??s just a pure mirror.,Yes
"It works great, as a DLNA Receiver for my WDTV Media server, however, I am having some challenges, upgrading to pro version",Yes
"I tried to stream the Peacock App from my iPhone and iPad and kept getting a notice about my ad-blocker not working. I thought this was a free app and there's not enough on-screen directions to a) enable a trial period or b) access the app settings. It was very frustrating and I have no idea why there's a ""Thickness"" rating for this app, but it was pretty ""thick"" alright.",Yes
It helpful because you can control the start and stop no problems all good so far,Yes
"Thought it wouldn't work but it does,.just a bit of interference between tap hoping but I definitely recommend getting it I give it 5 out of 5 stars for sure",Yes
This is the only one I found that had a pause and side control.It works out pretty good when I am recording!10/10√∞???,Yes
"I have the Fire HD 10.  It does not work at all.  When you press the ""Play"" button, it says the recording is pause.  I fumble with it for 15 minutes and didn't make any progress and conclude that it just doesn't work. At first I thought buying the app when help but nope!  Don't bother.",Yes
"This app is not recommended for videos longer than 1 minute... In my, safe, and honest oppinion, this app is horrible. Here are some of my reasons:*It doesn't let you edit your videos,*When you pause your videos, the controls button disapears after 5 seconds of your video being paused,*When you're recording you on-screen video, if it's longer than one minute, automatically pauses and ends your videos,*If you want screen recording with your face on it, you need the pro version, which costs money,*Sometimes it will save and show your video, but it'll erase all the footage and make it from a 15 minute video, into a 0 second video,Those are my reasons. Yet, just because I mention my opinion and a lot of people agree, doesn't mean you shouldn't download the app, or you shouldn't like the app. In all honesty, this is my own opinion, and you shouldn't depend on just one bad comment.",Yes
It kept making the main thing that controlled it disappear so my vids got deleted,Yes
Good app! I thought it was useful,Yes
"I read the reviews and thought ""Wow it seems like a nice app"" so I downloaded it and I can't get it to start recording on gacha life. Does the game have something to do with it?",Yes
I record videos for youtube and thought this was a good app but I does not even play back my videos it just say it's unable open the video or something. Sucks!!!,Yes
Ok it's so glitch it's good but whenever I want to watch my vid it always says video unavailable to watch the audio is crap. But I'm probably gonna figure it out.ps my reaction sometimes√∞??¬†√∞??¬°√∞???,Yes
I thought this would be the perfect app after all the reviews. NOPE!! I filmed the same video over 3 times and every time it kept saying CANNOT PLAY VIDEO!!! THE GKOD REVIEWS ARE LYING THIS APP IS SO FAME. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME U WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. √∞??¬§,Yes
"I THOUGHT that I was going to be able to record some minecraft easily, but No. I have to set stuff up with my computer. IF YOU HAVE A KINDLE, I Don't recommend.  ------",Yes
I thought I could start my own youtube videos but I realise you need to hook it up to the computer and it takes up so much space and it made me √∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???,Yes
"I thought it would record what was happening on my screen but I could never tell whether I was recording of not. Than it kept lagging and freezing up my screen. I couldn't even view the recordings I managed to get. I was able to see 1, and there was no video of the screen.",Yes
I thought it was a good app,Yes
"This app is but ridden. Oh screen controls not working properly, videos canning be viewed even if you mange to record one, causing screen to lock up and apps to crash. Would give 0 stars if possible.",Yes
"Ok, so I did all the things I needed to do, but when I looked at my video, it was so glichy!! It was like the content on the screen was stretched out.. I know the people who run this app probably are  of looking but if you fix this I will rate this a five and share with my friends.  Plus I'm 11 so kids my age are into exploring that kind of stuff so PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!!!",Yes
"I'm not saying it's a bad app,it's got lots of directions and is straight forward.BUT for the people that don't have a root,don't have a computer,or at least can't use it,don't waste your time and money on this app.I really love this app and thought it would work by all the good reviews,but it sucks for me.And I STILL used the root! √∞???√∞??¬§√∞???. I am really trying to find a screen recorder for kindle fire..For the people that are getting this,keep in mind that it NEEDS andR-O-O-T:root!!! Hope it works for you! Best of luck.√∞???I have just 1 request... :  PLZ MAKE A DECENT SCREEN RECORDER FOR KINDLE FIRES!!!!(HD too!!)IF SO,PLZ MAKE IT POPULAR SO I AND EVERYONE ELSE CAN FIND IT TOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Hope for the best!  -TwistyCinnamon-",Yes
"I thought WOW!!! I downloaded it immediately, what a big let down. It would not even load. I would turn it on and it would shut off in 5 seconds. WOULD RECOMMEND TO PEOPLE WHO LIKE TO BE RIPPED OFF!!!",Yes
This is exactly what I was looking for.  I thought it was going to be a scam  but it works great on my kindle.,Yes
"I thought by the rating that it must be good because it had a lot of people rating 5 stars. I downloaded it and tried doing a video and when I was done, it was all messed up and you couldn't see anything",Yes
The controller button disappears when I close the app...,Yes
"I legit just got this and I already love this screen recorder app √∞???. This app definitely just is so amazing and wonderful for recording on YouTube and Minecraft √∞???. First, I never thought I would ever record on my YouTube again, but now that I have this app, I can literally do everything √∞??¬ç. I very much appreciate if u get this screen recorder app Hehe √∞??¬è",Yes
"OK so, being a youtuber is my dream and I thought this would help me, But I was wrong. It keeps dissapearing when I'm getting into one of my games. I don't highly recommend this app.",Yes
"I downloaded this app to record gameplay for my YouTube channel. It works great, and the controls are easy to use. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to start, or already has, a YouTube channel.",Yes
It's great for reaction videos and stuff and it helps with gacha life,Yes
"I thought this was going to be crap compared to what I've seen before, but its DECENTLY AWESOME. Just pause as little as possible or the sound will stop working.√∞???",Yes
chhgvfftgfyuucycjhgcjgcjgcnhgvfchgfngcngc it up for that to you too control,Yes
I thought it said no root needed.. SURE THING THE VERY FIRST THING IT TOLD ME TO DO WAS PLUG INTO A COMPITER. So yea how about you don't lie to the people downloading? That would be great.,Yes
This app is good but at first I did not know how to hook it up so heed my warning if you're not good at understanding and following directions do not get this app but other than that it has great recording so ya hope you like it,Yes
"At first I was amazing! But then, it started lagging and the controls button started disappearing. Fix it. If you dont, zero stars.",Yes
"At first it was pretty good, there was a control pad with pause and stop, you can change the opacity and a lot more but one thing was annoying. The notification would not go away even when I try to swipe it, it still doesn't go away. Anyways, pretty good. I wanted to make a recording of me creating a gacha life character and when I did it it worked, but when I opened the app to see my recording, it would not open. I tried all apps to open it. Still wouldn't work. Please, I uninstalled it 4 time and it won't do what I need it to do.Would Not Recommend. Please do not get.",Yes
Ok I thought this would be a really cool app because it had AWSOME raitings but it keeps on crashing I recommend kindle people should not get this app.,Yes
"My husband spent a couple of hours trying to get the channel to work right. At first, I thought it was our Internet signal, so I went back to Sling to see if the other shows worked; they worked fine -_- for some reason, it just wouldn't stream our game, and when it did stream it, the picture quality was terrible and it kept freezing. Awful.",Yes
"I bought a fire tv cube, because the 2 Firestick√¢??s I had purchased previously didn√¢??t work. Where I lived previously the Firestick never even flickered. I√¢??m ready to return all of my products and get cable. I√¢??ve rebooted computer, tv and Firestick and cube. I don√¢??t have any receipts, just the cube box, I bought the cube and one of the Firestick√¢??s at Bestbuy and the other stick I cannot recall. What do you think the problem is? Is there something I should be doing? Everyone in the house use cable, I like having control of what I watch, not what the cable company wants me to watch. Also I love live sports. Please help or give me my $130 ish back. Yours truly,  Pierre Langlois",Yes
"not sure but it said the service was not available in my area. maybe it was just the exact think I was looking for was not available.  I live in Wyoming and get ""local"" channels (Denver and Cheyenne) thru dish network.  I was looking for the Broncos game on this app because the dish network channel was really jerky.  Thought I would try the app... disappointed",Yes
"I thought that I would miss the Superbowl since we do not have a cable service provider, but luckily while browsing my Amazon Firestick, an ad ran at the top of the screen which let me know that I could stream the big game right from the CBS app! Too bad the game wasn't great, but at least being able to watch it and not miss out was.",Yes
"Useless, did not know how to operate the dumb thing, Missed the entire Notre Dame game, very upsettting.  Why must you people make changes sometimes the status quo is okay, tecnology  is not for everyone.  Can we view the Notre Dame game on regular channels, if not it is time to change carriers.",Yes
I thought √¢??All Access√¢?¬ù would allow me to watch NFL games on CBS not in my area...nope. It knows where you are and will only feed the local game....so waste of time and money.,Yes
The Superbowl!  Thought we were going to have to miss it.  What a nice surprise (even though the game and ads sucked - who knew?)  Thanks CBS and Amazon!  Now if we can only get the big tennis matches...,Yes
"I tried to watch the super bowl using the app, and it kept cutting out. So I thought it might be my internet, but when I watched it using youtube tv there were no problems. So I blame the app.",Yes
"Easier than i thought, clear picture, it did go offline one time.  Too bad the game was not worth all the effort to make sure i could watch it√¢?¬π√Ø¬∏¬è  I will keep the app to watch other programs.",Yes
"I loved it but didn't want to be ""enrolled"" into a subscription and pay for it.  I thought if I downloaded the channel with my fire tv stick, it would have been for free.thanks anyway",Yes
I enjoyed the ability to watch the playoff football games while working on a project in my garage and without a cable connection. My only problem was the buffering of the program interrupted some game action. The other issue I had was the quality of the resolution was not great on my HDTV. I guess there were two more issues that bother me and that was not having the ability to rewind the program so I could replay some action or record the program.,Yes
Buffering was annoying...thought it was my internet but none of the other streaming apps had issues.  Other than that it was good and I was able to catch the boring Super Bowl lol,Yes
"From the title of the app, I thought I could √¢??stream and watch live√¢?¬ù sports.  That is incorrect.  I could watch only replays of sports news.  In order to watch sports events, you have to have a cable or satellite subscription. I guess if I were in the road and wanted to watch a random game, that would be ok. However, I cut the cable so I could stream. This app is worthless to me.",Yes
"Pretty much useless. Thought I could watch CBS sports network on it, but couldn't. It's just clips of shows and other stuff that's meaningless.",Yes
"Didn't really care for the app. Video quality was great but I thought this was going to be more like the Fox sports app or ESPN and it's not at all. I thought that you could view various games appearing on CBS networks for college football, yeah not so much. Uninstalled and uninterested.",Yes
"I thought I might see the early rounds of the Masters using this app. But, in order to get that coverage, I had to subscribe to it. I did NOT. Not on my budget. So, I deleted the app from my Prime Fire TV viewing list.",Yes
Thought it was Network TV --- not  Could not see Sunday football that was on CBS.,Yes
I thought I would be able to use a TV provider sign in to be able to watch games like Fox sports but it required a CBS subscription. Three stars because it's not what I hoped but couldn't comment on the actual app itself,Yes
Don√¢??t use it as much as I thought I would.,Yes
"This is not what I wanted..please cancel trial. I thought I would see actual games going on today, but could not.. stop/ cancel.",Yes
"I thought it was a little too expensive for something  you get free with an antenna, seemed to buffer a lot.",Yes
Not anything like I thought it would be.,Yes
"It did not work, I get nothing unless I have cable and I thought that was the entire point of fire stick, If I would have known that fire stick is useless I would never have spent 80.00 for nothingnot easy to use, not easy to set up nothing works.",Yes
I thought I would be able to watch games broadcast on cbs. I could only watch what was being shown in my market. Which I would get on regular broadcast tv anyway,Yes
not what i thought,Yes
I thought I could stream the football game,Yes
"Great purchase reasonable prices,smooth transaction,great deals",Yes
I just bought the fire stick 4K. It was to replace the original fire stick I bought a few years ago and was on a special price sale. Really my remote control for the first one just fell in water and I couldn't use it so well and compared to the 4K the old one had its day.Still getting some pixelization and buffering but far less and there are all kinds of videos to help on YouTube to even do things that people don't know fire sticks do?With the half-price sale and the quality of the stream that I get now I'm happy I spent a few more dollars to get updated to 4K,Yes
"Not what I thought it was, really not interested",Yes
"I expect to be able to watch content for events not available through traditional means.  as of Jan 2020, the content was the same as the CBS Sports Channel on Hulu.",Yes
"If you are a sports fan any kind, you will love this app. You just pout in your interest and it will keep you on all the action and scores for your team or your sport. I would say it is my most used APP.GO BRAVES and FALCONS!",Yes
We thought we would actually see a game not listen to pre taped people talking,Yes
"There was a time that ESPN ruled all of sports news broadcasting . But their ego has got the better of them and it's just not fun to watch , listen, or read anything to do with ESPN so I sought out a reasonable alternative and after shopping around at a lot of of the halfhearted efforts when it comes to sports scores, and accurate sports recaps and information , CBS, of all apps,  if you can believe it or not, turned out to be the one that fits my needs. I plug in all of my favorite teams and get current scores and status reports on my phone which I love. It's like I get the info before my sports buddies and it actually looks like I know what I'm talking about!! LOL. But seriously I enjoy this application on my phone , on all my tablets, and on my desktop , and they are all linked up . My teams cover a vast myriad of sports from soccer to football to Olympic action to baseball, my first love, and by the way CBS has a lot of good stats to . Can't say it's a hat that will fit everyone but it certainly works for me and I suggest everyone give it a try . Unless you work for ESPN.........",Yes
Wasn't what I thought it would be,Yes
Not what I thought it was. Unable to play live games,Yes
"Not what I wanted at all. I thought I was going to actually watch sports, not highlights & BS",Yes
I thought I could stream CBS local NFL games on Firestick but I guess not.... without paying a monthly fee.,Yes
Thought is more games to watch instead of highlights,Yes
"Just a bunch of studio stuff, no highlights of action, just people talking about what happened.  Not worth my time.",Yes
No live action. Will be removing it from my APP selection,Yes
"Not what I expected. Thought it was for streaming sports programs; if that's what you expect too, skip this. I think CBS wants us to pay for all access.",Yes
I am not paying for another station. I thought I could access it with my fire stick.,Yes
"My husband downloaded this app because he thought it was connected to CBS's fantasy sports, it isn't.  It has the scores, etc. but it isn't what he thought it was.  I can't rate it as good or bad, as it wasn't what he expected.",Yes
This APP wasn't really thought out before it was launched..very hard to find actual shows..mostly clips.,Yes
didn't do what I thought it would.,Yes
Very good app for folks interested in sports results.  Allows you to tailor searches to get immediately what you are looking for.  Very well thought out presentation.  A quality app.,Yes
I thought I would be able to watch Boise state games and games on CBS Spots. I can√¢??t so it was a waste of time for me,Yes
Not what I thought it was I can√¢??t watch and football games,Yes
"Quick updates, fairly intuitive to use.  Works very nicely.  Lots of information available.  Makes my Kindle seem more powerful than I thought it was.  Highly recommend.",Yes
"Based on the name of the app, I thought I would see actual games but it is only commentary.",Yes
"We thought we would be able to stream a college football game.  No live games, very dissappointing.",Yes
Wasn't able to watch the Football game on Sunday..Thought this app was free.,Yes
thought they were streaming a sport program but they were not.,Yes
Thought I was going to see live action football.  That was a joke.  Disappointed.,Yes
Looks very useful.  Watched Torrey Pines on it and would have missed the action without it.,Yes
With thought it was ok it had a lot of blurriness but other than that it was ok,Yes
Not what I thought it was.  Disappointing,Yes
"thought I would get to watch a football game, very deceiving",Yes
"There are no options to control screen such as recording,CC.",Yes
not what i thought it was,Yes
It kept freezing every 2 minutes. I thought it was my internet but when I try slingtv it was working fine.,Yes
Not what I thought it was. No real sports in it,Yes
"Great app for watching Super Bowl 50. I was texting friends during the game, so I was aware that I was just a few seconds behind the live TV broadcast, which is actually amazing for a live feed with so many viewers, I had expected it would be worse. And for me, a few seconds was totally fine since we only texted gossip about the halftime show and not the actual plays... Amazing opportunity for me (who refuses to get cable TV or any traditional TV for that matter) to be able to watch Super Bowl from home instead of heading out to a crazy bar. I also loved that the advertisements were the same ones as on TV. Previous years' Super Bowl apps were slower and didn't have the real ads. Well done!",Yes
Love it.  Very easy to use and get the latest scores and even play by play action.  We have installed it on our phones and tablets.,Yes
I liked the live tv. Also thought some of the highlight reels were great. Thanks.,Yes
I thought they were great. The fact that this came with Amazon Fire TV just claims my statement.,Yes
I can track the status (scores and highlights) of my favorite football teams,Yes
Thought I could watch live sports events. The only videos are over 5 years old,Yes
"Thought I had access to watch local college games, but requires Cable subscription as well.",Yes
"Still exploring different areas, but mainly the NFL and MLB.It seems a little slow at times while trying to follow the game",Yes
I still can't see anything...thought it was suppose to work anywhere....,Yes
Thought I could stream live tv using this app but it didn't seem possible once I opened it.,Yes
"This app does not stream well and stop constantly. I have fiber 1G of speed and at first thought it could be related to the internet. But all the other apps were streaming live programs without a problem, so it must have been the CBS app that was not working properly.",Yes
"This is a great app for people who want a quick way to check the score of their favorite teams.  Simple, easy to read, interface.  No special signup (unless ESPN) is required.  Live game tracker so you can keep up with all of the action when you are on the go.",Yes
"I downloaded this app in hopes I could use it to watch the Super Bowl in HD through the Fire TV Stick. I have Charter high speed internet clocking in at 60mbs, but this app had terrible lag. The video was terribly out of sync with audio. I thought it may just need reloading so I exited the app several times during the pregame show and even restarted the Fire TV Stick. Nothing seemed to work. We ended up watching the game on our TV using an antenna. Couldn't be more disappointed.",Yes
"I don't have cable. I'm an old-school cord cutter (dropped cable back in 2007 - haven't even missed it and have saved thousands of dollars over the years not having it). So I heard you could ""Watch Super Bowl 50 LIVE with the CBS sports app"" ---- I thought ""yeah right"".... Low and behold, I downloaded it the morning of the game, and I'd say around 2pm ET I clicked ""watch now"" on the app and there it was.... pre-talk and commentary all the way up until the game, and then the game itself. No buffering/streaming issues and fantastic HD picture quality. I was pleasantly surprised.",Yes
Thought it would be in HD,Yes
"My favorite sports scores/news app on my iPhone!  Much better than anything from ESPN (go figure) or anything else I've tried. Very clean interface and well-thought out menus, including saving favorites and watching scoring updates for games in progress. For a free app, it has a minimum of ad banner noise. Highly recommended!",Yes
"I thought the production of the Super Bowl was very well planned out and executed with great care and professionalism. I liked that it pretty much looked like it moved right along. Even the half time show seemed to get in and out and still be memorable. Oh,  ad my wife's cousin setting an NFL record 61 yard punt return was icing on the cake.",Yes
"CBS Sports is great - Best place to check on all the scores and follow ""live game action"" !",Yes
I could only get yesterday's comments on games by guys I never heard of. Thought I could get the KU game live. Not useful for me.,Yes
I thought that I was going to get to watch the games.  I only get the scoreboard.  What a letdown!A sad fan,Yes
"I thought there would be live sports coverage, especially since I subscribe to CBS. This is the second CBS app fail on my fire TV (the first being the CBS app). Get it together CBS! I deleted it within five minutes.",Yes
I downloaded that app because I thought we can watch live games but I guess we can't we that app.,Yes
Thought I was going to get live tv and instead just got taped videos.  Then while I was watching one it changed to a different one so I didn't get to finish the original.,Yes
"Great product!I love this app. I currently do not have cable so I decided to get a Amazon fire stick for all of our entertainment needs. I works wonderfully. Not only do I get to watch what I want but I don't have to spend an arm and a leg just to watch a few channels. It's easy and to install and get this app. I enjoy having all the control over my television, all you need is an internet connection and then you are good to go. And you also get 1080 p with it. Would recommend this to anyone. I love this app. I currently do not have cable so I decided to get a Amazon fire stick for all of our entertainment needs. I works wonderfully.

It's easy and to install and get this app. I enjoy having all the control over my television, all you need is an internet connection and then you are good to go. And you also get 1080 p with it. Would recommend this to anyone.",Yes
So far I find it disappointing as I thought there would be live sports streaming.  Nothing like that yet !,Yes
"Works great, was only seconds behind real time action.  Easy to setup teams to follow.",Yes
Me and my family really enjoy having CBS Sports and are so happy that we never have to miss out on any of the sports action anymore!,Yes
"This is two different apps depending on the device, so pay attention to the app description above to see if you'll be one of the 5 star or the 1 star folks. On phones and tablets it is a full featured app with live streaming and things like bracket challenges. On the Fire TV devices it's a horribly useless app where you can only stream seemingly random clips from different shows, but no live streaming. This makes one of the most useful use cases (streaming the live game that is being preempted by a game running late) for TV devices a no-go. It's not like this is a premium paid channel, so blocking from streaming while freely broadcasting makes literally no sense.",Yes
"Hands down this is the best of the sports apps out there.  I would have thought Espn would have been best, but CBS takes home the trophy.",Yes
"The app sucks! Misleading, when I downloaded, I thought I would be able to watch something that was advertised. I thought I would be able to find it from the landing page, but couldn't find what was shown.",Yes
It's not what I thought it would be. Just a bunch of commentary when I was looking for a certain  bball game,Yes
I downloaded it because I thought it was part of my xfinity package. Turns out there is a monthly fee. I uninstalled it,Yes
I got this because where I live I do not have access to cable and satellite is too expensive.  I do however have high speed internet through a program with ATT.  it is their home phone with added internet.  This internet is only available to rural households that do not have access to cable.  I only get 50 gigs but it is enough for now.Anyway once app is installed you get about 5 minutes preview then you have to sign up....No problem I thought...Wrong.  When you sign up you have to sign in with your cable tv provider.  That is ridiculous.  If I had a cable tv provider I would have Fox and not need this app...  what the hell is the purpose,Yes
I liked being able to watch hockey games from the beginning and pausing the action when necessary. Very useful app. One thing I wish you could do is move forward or back by more time than the program allows. Have to hot the fast forward button to many times.,Yes
There is not a Guide to inform you where to look for what you are wanting to watch.  We thought that our Seahawks game would be on this station as DirecTv has discontinued the Fox Network.  But could find the game.  Maybe an explanation of what is included in the subscription would be wise for other viewers.,Yes
"I thought I had read all the small print, so last week I started watching the Cal/Stanford Big Game.  In the middle of the second quarter the transmission stopped and a message popped up that I was finished with my free view and would have to pay to see the rest of the game.  NOT HAPPY",Yes
"I wanted to watch the Super Bowl in 4K by using this app on my new Samsung Q90 tv, but quickly switched back to my normal cable tv source.  The video was frequently stopping and we didn't want to miss any of the action.  I think their servers were probably overloaded that day.  I don't watch a lot of sports, so I haven't tried it since then.",Yes
"I thought I could see all the FOX programming and that I could only do if I had gone through my cable provider, which I have no interest in doing. Once I got that it worked great. The stream lost itself a couple of times but not so bad I could not enjoy the Super Bowl.",Yes
"We thought we could receive current games, games in progress, with the Fox Sports feature, but it appeared to us the feature was for games and news about games that occurred in the past. It appears ESPN was about the same thing and we were not interested in it either.",Yes
Too long a delay between live action TV broadcast and that seen using the app.  We had two televisions in two rooms to allow our Super Bowl party guests to spread out. One TV was connected to FIOS and the other to internet app.  Everyone came to the live TV because the delay was unacceptable.,Yes
The Fox Network couldn't control their hate speech in their Fox ads.  Someone else please buy the rights to the Superbowl so I can avoid these racists.,Yes
Great picture and streaming quality. Putting-up with the continuous banter was one thing but letting Fox slam as many ads on at half time was typical Fox. Almost as an afterthought there was a small amount of recap and commentary squeezed in. Shame.,Yes
"poor image quality w lots of skips, occasional slo-mo streaming. Thought poor image quality may be my wifi signal, but a Netflix flick immediately after streamed smoothly. Also hard to figure out how to get rid of CC, which was on by default and greatly annoying for being 10s ahead of the video, but eventually found the right button to shut off on the Amzn remote.",Yes
"We were trying to figure out a way to disconnect from Satelitte TV and thought this app would help through our Amazon Firestick.  However, after we downloaded the app, you still have to provide a TV provider in order to use.  Well that was useless, since we already have FoxSports1 throught Direct TV.",Yes
"I thought it was free , it's not,I am not looking to pay  money for channels, It cost enough just for the internet and amazon prime,",Yes
"Since Fox has a contract for the NFL I thought there would be games on this station. Disappointed again, so discontinue",Yes
"Was a nice thought and hope to see some sports but, as one who does not have cable TV, I was directed to some other subscription options which I didn't want.  So, it didn't work out for me in particular ...",Yes
"I thought it was free, you need a subscription.",Yes
"The fast forward controls only allow you to skip forward about 6 seconds at a time.  It then takes about 4 seconds to load before you can fast forward again.  I watched a recorded game and had to restart.  It lost my place and I had to pickup from the beginning.  It took most of an hour to fast forward to the 1.5 hour mark.  I would give a lower rating, but the streaming quality is fine if you watch from beginning to end.",Yes
"I'm giving this app a 3 because without it I couldn't watch some replays on demand.  With that being said, watching is quite a challenge as the program continually freezes for short periods of time while watching.  It's by far the poorest quality app I use.",Yes
I thought it was free and it wasn't,Yes
My friends thought Fox Sports Go was terrific.  I am not a sports fan as such but my friends are,Yes
Thought I could get a college  football game i wanted to watch they told me to down load this but NOT,Yes
Won't let me watch the games I want because I'm not in that area. I thought that was the point of using an app so I could watch games I can't get in my area.,Yes
We can only get satellite where we live and internet is poor. We no longer can watch this station because they are choking Dish Network to pay more and charge us more. So disappointed in Fox. I thought you were better than this.,Yes
"NOT AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE, BUT OK, AFTER ALL IT IS FREE.",Yes
"In order to use this app you basically need cable.  We have high speed Internet, Netflix and a fire stick but we don√¢??t have traditional cable.  We were unable to watch the vents we wanted.  Total waste",Yes
All I thought it would be and more.,Yes
I thought this was √¢??free√¢?¬ù and didn√¢??t know a charge would follow later.,Yes
"I thought I could watch world cup, but it need a cable and I do not have it :(",Yes
Got it to watch the OSU game. What a fiasco.Then I thought it would show more college games - does not show very many.,Yes
"Didnt know you needed to have a tv provider to use this i thought the whole point of having a ""Firestick"" was to get rid of my cable",Yes
"Thought I√¢??d be able to access it on my Amazon Fire Stick-no go. Had to watch on my phone instead. Don√¢??t really know the point of offering devices that include your tv, if it√¢??s not compatible. It could be operator error... but ended up watching the game on a very small screen.",Yes
"I got the firestick because I thought all of these channels came with it! If I paid for all of these, it would cost as much as cable!",Yes
I thought my husband would have some enjoyment however he never uses it,Yes
"I only purchased it in order to watch the Women's World Cup. The quality when I was streaming to my phone was pretty good, although it had a slight problem with stalling out when my phone thought there might be a WiFi connection around.The website has tons of information, but is not super intuitive, unless what you want to watch is the main featured match. It took me some time to figure out where I was going when I wanted to watch the current live match, but didn't necessarily know who was playing in that live match. It would be helpful if they made a clear distinction between games you can watch after the fact (and there are a lot of them) vs games that are live.Subscribing (and then ending my subscription) was quick and easy.",Yes
Thought I'd be able to watch football on Sundays can't have to pay for service,Yes
"I downloaded this app so that I could watch the live stream of the breed competitions for the WKC 2020 Dog Show.  The app worked perfectly, which allowed me to see all the behind-the-scenes action.",Yes
It is absolute garbage that you cannot stream a past game on demand. The UI/UX is also thoughtless. Just clunky infinite scrolling to see what's on; no way to drill down or get an overview.,Yes
"NO Live NFL programming available, of your choosing....",Yes
"quality stream. has UFC and other action sports.Content selection is thin. need to have more options and add content that isn't only live streams (ie documentaries, sports shows, etc)",Yes
Wished I could watch My Dallas Stars in Missouri. I thought I could if I got Fox Sports Go.,Yes
"Massively frustrating! The screenshot in the Amazon App Store should be a gif of turquoise circle spinning! This app consistently freezes after 30-60 seconds with every game I watch. After it freezes, I'll hit the back button, select the game I want to watch again, it will play for 30 seconds and BAM - spinning turquoise circle! Sometimes, if you wait for a minute or two, it will eventually start playing again for another 30 seconds, and then freezes again.In my experience, this is the WORST streaming app from any cable channel or broadcast network. I have such a negative attitude towards this app that it's bled over to my feelings about my FireTV Stick. Since the NBA season started this year, I've been using my FireTV Stick less and less and using my Roku more. Now, I almost never use my FireTV Stick. The only time try to use it when I try to watch the Mavericks play.  I noticed that I was using the Roku almost exclusively a while back, but I couldn't really figure out why. Outside of FSGO, I was using mostly the same apps on both devices. But the more I thought about it, the more I came to realize that it's because this app is making me associate a bad experience with using my FireTv.",Yes
"Pro...Got me access to the game, and looked great on my phone.Con...action would stop for a few seconds, then continue. Happened throughout the game",Yes
"Both Fox sports go and Fox now both updated to a version that will not work right on a Kindle Fire (7th generation, so fairly new).  Takes you from the app to Fox website, which does not work well.  Keeps ""play"" arrow circle in the middle of the screen even minutes after you hit play. Also does not have all the options for forward and rewind.  When you go to ""having trouble?"" , it just says this is a beta version and they are working on bugs.  I thought beta testing was supposed to be completed before you forced that version on everyone.  Previous version was great for both apps - don't know why they have to 'fix' something that isn't broken.By the way, I was having the same problems on my laptop, so you can't blame it on Amazon!",Yes
Through a contract dispute we lost Fox network and I thought we would be able to watch football games on this. After my free trial was over I was informed I didn't have access.,Yes
"Not really what I thought it would be, just highlights and commercials for the most part",Yes
"I am a member on soccer2go which belongs to fox, so I thought I could watch the match on my big screen, but it didn't work for me. So I actually don't know anything about this app.",Yes
"Clear, expert, even-handed commentary; great action shots and replays.  Most importantly--  broadcasts games of the team I follow.",Yes
So far I'm happy. Ever ything works correc tly... As far as my understanding of these items are. 5 stars!,Yes
"I don't use this terribly often, but I've been using it to watch post-season baseball, and this app is terrible.  I thought maybe it was my wifi signal, but it doesn't have any trouble streaming NLDS games on TBS (or anything on Netflix, for that matter). I connected my fire tv via ethernet just to see, and it wasn't any better.  Please make this better, because right now, it's basically a worthless app.  It stutters and freezes so much that it's intolerable to watch anything on it.",Yes
Poor interaction.  Rocky much superior.,Yes
I WANT IT IN ENGLISH. I LIVE IN PUERTO RICO BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD GET IT IN ENGLISH NOT SPANISHAND WITH COMMERCIALS IN SPANISH. COULD NOT SEE THE SUPER BOWL COMERCIALS. NOT GOOD.,Yes
Wow great update to the app. Not!! Regional content is no longer included in the app even with a supported cable provider. Worst update ever. Who thought this was a good idea????,Yes
The wine bottle lights were not what I expected. Shorter and less lights than I thought.  I can buy more lights for  $.50 moreat Walmart! I would not buy again.,Yes
I thought that it broadcast the Yankee games but it did not.,Yes
we needed to have our outside tv  play the super bowl .... we didn't want to use one of our other wireless cable boxes so the amazon fire was called into action.  downloaded the fox sports go app and it worked perfect ....,Yes
Couldn't use it since I don't have cable or satellite. Thought apps would have evolved so you could just watch what channels you want. I well it was free,Yes
Thought I could watch MLB without any other cable or satellite subscriptions,Yes
"I got this app because I wanted to watch quality sports all the time.  However, the highly conservative nature of their sports reporting is offensive to me - if I wanted to hear stuff like this, I'd watch ""Rush Limbaugh's Sideline Roundup.""",Yes
I thought this was going to save the day but it stopped streaming the Superbowl and I didn't get to see the end. Thanks Fox.,Yes
This app is not as good as I thought.,Yes
"I thought if i got this app, I could watch Sunday football live games. I cannot",Yes
All i received was text  and i thought i was getting the actual game to watch,Yes
"I live outside of the United States and because the World Cup final was promoted all week on FOX Sports GO, I thought I was all set.  Would not load here, sadly.",Yes
Not having cable I found the Fox Sports Go channel useless.  I thought the Sling app would allow us to watch Fox Sports Midwest but have not found that to be the case.,Yes
I downloaded this because I thought I would be able to select my favorite team but it only shows a team from another state.,Yes
Simply not what I thought it would be. Deleted app shortly after getting it.,Yes
Meh. Was hoping to catch some FIFA World Cup action or coverage.,Yes
This product was not what I thought it was.  It wouldn√¢??t be fair for me to rate it.,Yes
"I thought I could see motorcycle racing , but could not find any . Maybe I was pushing the wrong buttons !",Yes
Did me no good as Direct TV has blocked FOX!!!!! Thought I could watch the football game but would not open!,Yes
"Ok,  but not as good as I thought it would be.",Yes
One of the best apps I√¢??ve ever used! Love that you can control the picture by stopping and starting and the ability to rewind play√¢??s.,Yes
Not what I thought.,Yes
I did not order this item...I don√¢??t watch sports....more accountsecurity needed,Yes
"I thought I would be able to watch the playoff game and paid the fee.  What I got was a radio broad casting of the game.  I was very upset, as I could get the game on radio without temporarily joining Fox  sports.  I did not get any other benefits like stats etc.  I felt this was false advertising. and cancelled the service after that day, but lost my $5.oo.",Yes
"4K was great, but stability of app was issue",Yes
It works! I got to see my favorite baseball team in action with no interruptions.,Yes
Lets me watch streaming live sports action when I am at a location that does not receive the sports venu I wish to watch.,Yes
Great idea but it wouldn't work on my Kindle Fire without HD status- very disappointed,Yes
"its just channels to watch streaming,  I thought it was sports news so I deleted it",Yes
"I have a Kindle Fire, so applications like this challenge it a bit.Otherwise, it allowed me to follow the game just fine.",Yes
"Let me start off by saying that I have very fast internet and my streaming device is Ethernet connected.  Now of course I downloaded this app to watch the Super Bowl this year, just like many other people did.  It started out working great but then after halftime it started to buffer and then eventually the stream was lost for quite some time.  Lucky for me I had other streams I could turn to in order to watch the game but I thought the FOX stream would have been the way to go.",Yes
This was not what we thought. Did not go into it.,Yes
"I was pretty excited when I first tried Fubo TV.  They have a wide selection of channels including the local sports channels I no longer have with my limited cable lineup.  Unfortunately, during my free trial period I experienced a lot of problems with the video being pixelated.  I thought it was just one channel, so I switched to the Weather Channel.  It worked well for a while, but then began to do the same thing.  This issue occurred while at my vacation house.  When I got home I installed the app on my Amazon TV.  There were no pixelation issues but no matter what channel I watch, at some point the video freezes and buffers.  This some times only occurs for a few seconds and other times I have to close and re-open the app.  It's too bad this channel doesn't appear ready for Prime Time.  I was looking forward to consolidating my video on Fubo and getting rid of Hulu and Sling.  Looks like at the end of the month I'll be getting rid of Fubo.",Yes
"I'm doing a free 7 day trial of FuboTV on the Amazon Fire Stick I've had for about a year now. I've tried a lot of streaming apps but this one just won't stream without difficulties.  My WiFi router is a few feet away and Fast.com says I get about 35-40Mbps, and everything else I watch works fine, but I can't get Fubo to go more than a few minutes. When I Was watching Dr. Who live Saturday night it woudln't go more than a minute w/o freezing, stuttering, dropping to SD, having the sound go but the picture freeze. My wife thought maybe it was just b/c Dr. Who was live streaming, so tonight we tried DC Legends of Tomorrow from a few weeks ago. It worked much better than Dr. Who, but about halfway through the screen went black but the sound kept going. Then everything stopped. Then it jumped back a bit. Just awful. I'd blame it on the WiFi or Fire Stick but really over a year of so many other services I've never had any problems like this.One thing which did work for awhile was hitting the Options button and changing the resolution to 480p from Auto in the drop down box. It didn't look very good but at least it played after that.I'll be stopping Fubo after the free trial and going back to watching The CW shows for free on The CW app. It has commercials, but it works like it should.If you want live streaming but don't need The CW channel PS Vue seems to be the best service out there right now. Not cheap, but the best experience. Philo is cheap, but the app is lacking. It does work though, unlike FuboTV.",Yes
"WHAT OTHERS HAVE MARKED THIS OFF FORContinuing to charge them after cancellation: I am continuing my subscription, so I cannot comment on this.Freezing: I watched the third place World Cup game and had no issues. I watched Leicester v. Man U and it only froze once when I took it to mobile and left the house. A few other PL games on NBC Sports have frozen for a minute or two. But overall, I do not get what others talk about when they say that it is so terrible. Even cable has its moments, sometimes much worse.Bad picture: Looks fine to me. Maybe the first ten seconds aren't great, but again, isn't that true with almost anything?Slow loading: Okay, here I have a hack. When I start fubo.tv from my Amazon Fire TV homepage, a loading circle comes up, often with the fubo background, but not always. It will rarely come out of this by itself. But I have noticed that if I press the back button, it immediately snaps out of it and doesn't take me back but instead takes me directly to fubo. Odd thing, but in the end, it's fine for me.You cannot rewind a live game, the way that you can on NBC Sports apps or Fox Soccer Match Pass, et al: Accurate. Goals may happen and you won't be able to see them if you are not there at the exact time or you didn't record it.MY MARKDOWNSPremier League: You think that you are getting NBC Sports, Bravo, USA (?)--every possible network you could in order to watch the Premier League (aside from the money-grubbing NBC Sports Gold). But you forget the obvious: NBC. It comes with your local Fox and CBS, but not ABC or NBC. I have found articles on fubo that say that with the TVEverywhere app, you can log-in to the NBCSports app with your fubo credentials and it will treat it like a cable subscription. This has not been the case for me. I am not clear why I was rejected, other than a message that said something like ""We're sorry, this provider does not have retransmission rights in your region"". From a fubo page, it appears that NBC in my market (Oklahoma City) is not carried (while others like Tulsa and tons of other markets are). I have confirmed this both on the NBC Sports site and on the app, where I have received the same message. So if I were 90 miles to the NW, then I would have this? This is not progress. The fubo article also says that I must have the TVEverywhere channel in my fubo subscription in order for this to work, yet when I search fubo packages for this channel, I find no such listing.Champions League: Heads up--I thought that I would be getting TBS & TNT, and the last I heard, the Champions League was moving to this family of stations in the coming year. But those are not actually included. I just overlooked it.How to make this better: NBC sucks. When it split its games across NBC, Bravo, USA, NBC Sports, it could act like it is helping the fan, but then when it puts some things on a platform like fubo and others, like NBC, not, then that's a big pain. It is either mistakenly not considering this or it is intentionally doing this for its own benefit to make things like this more cumbersome for the consumer, hoping that they buy something like fubo/sling and cable on top of it. I look forward to when NBC and others catch on to how they could make even more money by making life easier for the consumer rather than harder. After all, I hardly watch American football at all anymore. Everyone can turn you off.But what does that mean for fubo? I would like to see fubo make it easier to see NBC, or to at least have my questions answered. It knows that I want to see the Premier League. So list every game. When I click on it, tell me that it is on NBC Sports or Bravo, which I have, and take me there. If that particular game is on NBC Sports Gold, tell me that, and maybe NBC will pay for that ad. If it is actually on NBC itself, then give me a brief and clear instruction on how to watch NBC, and if I cannot, then please tell me why.I also don't find the guide that helpful. I prefer not to look at what is on TV currently because by the time you scroll through all your channels, if you want to go back up to the top and watch something that you saw up there, it takes so long just to get up there. I wind up perusing just the networks, where it lists them in rows of four, which allows me to scroll through to the channel that I want faster, if not the exact programming.WHAT IT GETS RIGHTI watch mostly BBC World News, HGTV, and sports-related channels. The Fubo network is pretty good--kind of like ESPN classic for soccer, but without actual game film. It also has Bein Sports, which has worked well the few times that I have watched it so far. The website is also pretty good.OVERALLIt does great with giving access to French and Spanish games via Bein Sports, which is nice. However, it offers access to only roughly 1/2 of Premier League games, due to some being on NBC itself and some being on NBC Sports Gold. And it does not offer Champions League games in English at all, although worldsoccertalk.com appears to say that I could watch Champions League and Europa League games in Spanish on Univision, which is on fubo. I don't have a problem with that if it will really happen. But what I want to see is an option where you can click on the sport and then the competition; it does have this, but if I am to judge by that, then that points out a few things: (1) No Serie A; (2) No Champions League or Europa League; (3) just 5/10 Premier League games on this particular weekend.As a stand-alone service judged compared to cable, I am pleased with this. It doesn't give you everything, but it does give you some international soccer extras and things like CBS Sports. Comparing to something like Sling, it appears that Sling wins on your regular cable networks, though they are comparable. But if you are really a big soccer fan, understand that you are basically comparing Bein Sports  $10 to TNT/TBS & ESPN, aka La Liga and Ligue 1 to the Champions League and whatever soccer ESPN offers. If you care a great deal about Mexican and South American games, then that will push up fubo in your eyes.",Yes
"I'm stunned by all the negative reviews for this service. I've run the gauntlet of streaming TV services. PS Vue, directTV now (AT&T TV NOW) sling tv and hulu  live. By far Fubo is the best I've had for many reasons. The best thing I'll say for fubo is this is the one I've had the least buffering with and I mean by a long shot. All of the other services were at times completely unwatchable. I've only had fubo buffer on me a few times for like a few seconds and never more then once in a night of viewing. Plus it's got the best channel lineup of any. The picture quality is noticeably better then the others I've had as well. It is a little pricey but still much cheaper then traditional cable.",Yes
"Fubo was a mistake! Thought I would be able to watch the Super Bowl however it was only available in Spanish ( commercials were English), had to place a call to them 3 times then finally was on HOLD for nearly 25 minutes just for them to tell me the ""English"" version was not available to my area. This wasn't the first issue with them, I am disgusted with Fubo, save your money because Fubo IS NOT worth the fee they charge. I subscribed but as soon as my subscription comes due I will be cancelling. No Super Bowl for us.. READ the reviews available on google, Don't waste your money on Fubo",Yes
"We have used this service for the last 5 months.  The attraction was getting Redzone, that being said the quality of the broadcasts are poor at best.  We have a 1g Wifi plus the smart tv is connected via Ethernet.  The ability to navigate the home screen with Samsung remote is not intuitive at all.  It doesn√¢??t matter if you record or watch something live, the app seems to buffer excessively.  Watching the Super Bowl put us over the edge.  The picture was highly pixelated and images were indistinguishable.  As soon as our month is over, we are done.  Very disappointed. And it is not cheap.  We are going to do Apple TV.",Yes
"I'm currently in the FuboTV seven day trial. Thus far, I've found a few bugs in the Fire TV app. (At least, if you're using the Fire TV Game Controller.) Pause, fast forward and reverse do not work. On the game controller, pressing the ""A"" button pauses Amazon, Sling, DirecTV Now and Playstation Vue playback. It does not, however, work with Fubo. Additionally, if you exit playback mid-program, there is no ""resume"" feature. Conversely, playback on a PC has no problems whatsoever. I just much prefer watching TV on an actual TV. (And yeah, I know, I can ""cast"" from my computer.)DVR recordings are limited to only 10. That's something I can live with because I'm only recording motorcycle racing on Bein Sports. That said, if I was using Fubo as my primary streaming service, that would be a deal breaker.As for image/video quality, there are no issues. It's on par with all of the other streaming services (aside from Amazon with their AMAZING UHD 4K playback.)I suspect FuboTV will fix their Fire TV app quickly, so I'll probably try them again in a few months. They are definitely on the right track, but the Fire TV app is certainly in its infancy.",Yes
"We cancelled our very expensive satellite TV subscription. We bought antennas and Fire TV set up on both of our televisions. They canceled BEIN sports on most satellite providers, but FuboTV has 12 BEIN sports channels. My husband has more football (soccer) than he can watch. I get all of the channels that I ever want or need to watch. Don't wait to switch. The antennas are a cinch to hook up. The Fire TV is fool proof. I am very, very impressed with the set up. Our Alexa remote is a universal remote, controlling the TV and soundbar. FuboTV is inexpensive and has an amazing channel line up. Check it out!",Yes
"I recently moved and have been unable to get suddenlink cable or directv or dish satellite services to provide service at my location (too many trees for satellite and the cable company is a joke, won't even provide a quote to extend service) so I began exploring cable alternatives.  FuboTv has a great selection of channels and it works on the devices I have.  The stream quality has been decent with the limited bandwidth I have (approx. 15mbps) and the picture quality is good most of the time.  I suspect this has more to do with my internet provider than it does the FuboTV service, I will try to update when my speeds get an upgrade in a month or so.  The cost isn't bad, but when compared to other services, it is probably about $10/month higher than it should be.  I WOULD recommend this to others as a good cable/satellite alternative.",Yes
"I thought things were going well, good reception, clear picture. Then it paused like it was uploading more content, then stopped completely! After rebooting the internet and the TV, the channel said the content was no longer available in my area and it quit broadcasting...... Indians vs Yankees game #1. I'm not sure what took place, but I will seriously consider cancelling any further subscription services.",Yes
"I had Sling, I loved it and I cancelled it as soon as I saw Fubo√¢??s list of channels. I didn√¢??t know you guys existed until two days ago. Exactly the package that I need which Sling, PS Vue, You Tube TV, Hulu, Direct TV Now don√¢??t provide for this price.Here are my thoughts on the 2nd day I√¢??m using it. I have 200MB internet speed and a pretty good tech environment at home.Windows version is good.I mostly use, if not all the time Amazon Fire TV. Honestly, it looks like it is in beta version at most.Lots of buffering and pixelation. If you√¢??re based mostly on sports, this is the most important feature. On live games, it worked better streaming on Chromecast from my phone.Stream Quality is not 1080p and 60hz on most of the channelsNot easy to surf the channels. I have to go back to the list to choose another one, when it should be the option to see what√¢??s on the other channels while I√¢??m on the current one.When I go back to the schedule, it defaults to Fox, the very first channel on the list and I have to scroll all way down if I want to go back to where I was previously watching.To make things worse, when I scroll up and down the list and I click the left side of Fire remote, it selects El Rey by default, no matter where I am. By now I√¢??m completely lost of where I want to go.Close Captioning are horrible. 1 - There is no way to personalize the fonts, background etc. Too big and cover good part of the screen. 2 √¢?? They have to be selected on each channel and they don√¢??t stay on when I change them.DVR is not available on Fire TVOn live sports tab, I clicked on Germany √¢?? Mexico game and something totally different showed upRW & FF don√¢??t work.So, it needs some workSince there is no remote with numbers and no numbers assigned to channels, should be some kind of grouping, same as you have for sports. Sorting by News, Movies etc, depending on what√¢??s on now and the channel type.Internet version on chrome is way better.It should be an option to add favorite channels and to be able to sort them to our preferences. Scrolling up and down it√¢??s too much time consuming.I√¢??ll keep Fubo for couple of months until the next soccer season starts and hopefully things will change, especially streaming quality.If I want buffering and low resolution games, I can find plenty of websites that show them for free.I√¢??m rooting for you guys. I really, really like what you got going.",Yes
"We are very disappointed because we thought we could get all of the NY Giants games (we've lost Fox on Direct TV). It sounded like the game on Sunday 9/22 would be streamed, but it wasn't.  We also found it difficult to navigate the app, but that could be our lack of experience.  All in all, we ended up paying for a month's viewing that we won't use and have discontinued the service. In our opinion, it was a case of false or misleading advertising.",Yes
"A long way to go before I cut my cable.  Very clutsy interface and not user friendly.  Had lots of pixilation and drop in picture quality.  Support is poor.  NO ABC so my wife hated it.  Some of the games I wanted to watch were not available but I could stream them on my iPad.  Cloud service is basic and problematic -- can't fast forward while recording in session, cant programs until they are scheduled.Thought I hated my cable until this!",Yes
Fubo is almost the only choice if you want to include NFL Network in your channel lineup. But the DVR controls for forward and back don't show a screenshot of where you are in the program so it's pretty useless. Other live TV apps have a better interface. We also had some stalling and slow start up with this app. We are going with a competitor even though they have less channels.,Yes
"We cut the cable; tried YouTube TV, Sling and then FuboTV; I had never heard of these guys;  Sling is owned by Dish, and they are who we dropped; service was OK; didn't like their channel guide and controls; YouTube TV had the worst controls; it took us awhile to get used to FuboTv ; they are a bit more expensive but so far we happy with the service; our ISP is Century Link and are not having many issues with buffering;",Yes
"I got Fubo specifically for NFL red zone and local live TV. Those were my must-haves. The interface and picture quality is good and the channel selection is OK, except no CNN!?!? Not happy about that. Very happy with the stability and picture quality, though. It√¢??s at least equal to Verizon fios cable TV. Might be better.",Yes
"FUBU tv is just ok, it's very ambitious which is good, but it's layout is lacking a well thought out navigation.  Leaving you to search for specifics to watch. It replays commercials over and over, so annoying. The price really sets this as out of usable for less money I would choose Hulu live or YouTube TV.",Yes
"When I saw this searching for a method to watch the Woman's World Cup; I thought it was too good to be true.  The channel seemed to be free.  I downloaded it and was directed to the signup website and after entering my email there I was presented with billing options.  The lowest one was $55 per month.All I wanted was to watch a few World Cup matches; I would gladly pay $15 or maybe $20 to watch any or all the matches in this years World Cup.  I even would be ok with $3 or $4 per match I wanted to watch.  If I wanted to spent this kind of money I would just get cable again.I never completed the signup.  I do not care what else they offered, I wanted 1 thing and they where extremely overpriced for that.",Yes
"So far this app has worked fairly well for me, had some buffering issues at the beginning but that was due to my slow internet service which eventually was fixed, the price is really fair for what is provided, I was paying before over $120,00 a month and I didn't have any sport channels other than just ESPN, that's why I dropped Direct TV. The only thing negative I can say for now is the ""Subtitles and Captioning"" that had recently been popping up on some channels, not sure thou if it is the TV networks but, that is annoying if you're watching a game, don't really have any options of function controls, so far I've having been able to figure out how to  get rid off the subtitled, in addition to it I also wish fubo TV will add on more sport channels, out of the 11 channels provided, 5 are about movies that no one cares about, I hope that fubo TV will improve it's service for more customers's satisfaction.",Yes
"Works ok. Had problems with pausing a video and having it start completely over and you can't fast forward. Also had problems with it recording shows that were labeled wrong. I clicked on the show that I recorded and it's a different show, under the show I thought it was', title. I like the channels it has though... when they work and don't show the loading circle.",Yes
"The ad said I could watch the game. Yeah, it records the game and you get to watch it after ""the live event"". Then they want $45 a month? I don't think so Tim. I thought I could watch a live game. This app didn't even make 24 hours.",Yes
DON'T DO 7 DAY TRIAL VERY CONFUSING doesn't Bring you to parts of the app where you cant get out of the trail until it shows up on your bank statement $64.00/monthly. And is somehow ties to ESPN. Even called tech support they had no answers??? Hours on the phone-still not resolved. More hours on the phone today. Major point; There is NO one place you can find everything you can find about ALL of your apps on Amazon five TV. SO if you get charged first get the bank transaction number. Then call Amazon and they say they will take it off.,Yes
I thought I would try Fubo tv since I just cut the cord. I just wanted the Paramount Network channel. $54.99 per month is a bit pricey though. I think I√¢??ll be canceling prior to the end of the 7 day trial.,Yes
"For the price, I thought I'd be able to watch ""on Demand"", but that's not the case.  You can record a few hours though.  Given the choice between this and Cable Tv, I'd take this.",Yes
Fubotv is awesome. It has excellent sports package and regular TV combinations. It's the only service that has AT&t Sportsnet for rockets and Astros action.,Yes
We recently decided end our cable television service. Opted for Internet only from our provider and then play for this service. So far so good. You get a suitable amount of broadcast television. The sports packages is great.The stability has been very good so far,Yes
"It's easy to get into. I'm ""technologically challenged,"" so I get frustrated easily, and this is a hell of a lot easier than youtubetv!",Yes
I have fubotv for over 2 years. I thought it was great!! Than they took local channels away. I only have NBC. No!! CBS or ABC.  Also CNN is removed no big loss!! The problem is CBS  carries all our local NFL games. ..so before you sign up make you search it out . I bought an hd. Antenna for 45 bucks I get now 56 channels all my locals  . I have an fire stick and watch Pluto tv tubi ..for news!!,Yes
Thought I was gaining access to NBA playoffs (Rockets vs Lakers - game 1) but found out that I needed to make additional purchase.  Don't see much here that I will be using.,Yes
"I did a lot of research before making the switch, this stream package had all the channels we watch and a fraction of the DirecTV monthly cost. Wife is happy that every TV works the same, still exploring the functions but it's always available... even in bad storms which makes my dogs happy. Recommending to all my friends.",Yes
"With all of the streaming services, I thought hey let me try Fubo.  First this is 65 dollars a month, I can view sports some other way.",Yes
I downloaded the app because I thought it was included with Prime. I did not want to pay an additional fee so I did not use it,Yes
Navigation and recording a bit difficult with Firestick. Need better controls for changing viewing.,Yes
"Couldn't get it to English in the control panel. Did not get the Patriots pre season games, which is whole reason why I signed up!",Yes
I√¢??m a Titans fan living in Bengals country. I wanted to watch my Titans and thought this would be the way to do that but when I tried to find the game the only one I could watch was the one playing on local channels.,Yes
"Very nice to have, could use better software and more control of display.",Yes
I didn't get to use it The cost was way to much . I thought it was free with prime.,Yes
"Such a deal, I was paying 40$ for YouTube TV...now i'm only paying a fraction of that..thanks to my Amazon stick",Yes
I thought it would have more of a selection of sports.,Yes
"Sorry, I thought it was free like Pluto, so I did not pursue",Yes
I didn't get the program I thought they carried.,Yes
Cant write a review.  I don't get fubo tv. I thought it was free. Apparently it's not.,Yes
"I mistakenly thought with fubo I could watch NBCSP and MSG. in AZ.  but apparently its for local markets (Philly, NY) I was hoping to watch the Flyers and Rangers, Islanders games. will probably just keep my Hulu.",Yes
I thought I would be able to watch out of market sports programs but can not.I think it is a good value and I will purchase it once I set all my TV's to use it.  It will save me almost $60/mo over what I pay for direct tv.,Yes
Thought this was for American football,Yes
The main reason why I got this app is to watch the EPL. The bonus it does have movie selection from family to action and tv shows which I haven't messed a lot with.,Yes
The app delayed on an episode of a show and then a message popped to say that the device was not compatible even though it allowed me to sign up online with asecurity code.,Yes
"I thought I would get more spanish channels with my latino subscription but Univision was the only good one, plus prices after free trial are just as high as cable",Yes
Wish I could just go channel to channel but can√¢??t with Firestick. Miss movie channels. Still exploring all the features.,Yes
All the channels we love for a fraction of the cost. Also included cloud dvr!,Yes
when it did not work tyler 9475 tried to sell me virus protection.do not trust after this.,Yes
Registration website was broken.  Never able to complete the transaction.  Never received what we wanted.,Yes
"Not interested, thought it offered more.",Yes
Fubo TV was everything I was looking for at a fraction of the cost.,Yes
Wasn't what I thought it would be.,Yes
"THE APP IS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS, THAT I WHY i CANCELED.",Yes
It√¢??s slow and doesn√¢??t offer as many channels as I originally thought. I√¢??m cancelling after my free week trial. I√¢??ll jusr stick with Hulu to live stream,Yes
I thought I was signing up for a week trial and they charged me for 2 months.,Yes
"Heavy delays and stoppages. Thought it was internet, but was channel specific on Fubo.",Yes
I deleted the app. I thought it was free.,Yes
The price is great here t there are no parental controls for the premium channel,Yes
Thought it would be better than DIRECTV NOW. It√¢??s a little better for sports but doesn√¢??t cover other networks that we like.,Yes
Not all the channels I thought,Yes
"I was using the FuboTV app on my FireTV stick, and it was working terribly...pausing often to buffer, lousy video quality, terrible user interface with non-intuitive controls and fast forward/back scrubbing that would only jump in 9 minute increments.  I was about to give up on the FuboTV service, but then they upgraded the application earlier this month (Jan 2017), and what an incredible difference it has made!  Since the upgrade, the video quality has been consistently good (both live viewing and recorded matches), and it has not had to pause to buffer video even once.  The user interface is much better now, with high-speed scrubbing when you hold down the fast forward/back button.  Good stuff!  Thank you to FuboTV for fixing this app!!!  Now I can cheer on Barca without technical distractions!  Just one remaining issue...I can't seem to turn on the SAP alternate audio...this would be helpful for the matches that are broadcast with Spanish commentary.",Yes
Disappointed -thought it was included in Amazon Prime...tired of paying for access :(,Yes
Doesn't work on phone. I travel on the weekends. Thought i would be able to watch football on my phone.,Yes
Wasn't what i thought it was going to be,Yes
"It's a great idea but it seems to need some work on stability.  I couldn't watch some futbol matches that were on my list of channels.  Also the DVR option only lets you record one match at a time.  I feel for the price of the subscription, this should be increased.  Overall, I love the idea of the app, but I am not satisfied with the quality.  They may patch it to fix these issues I have with it one day.",Yes
Free trials are the new way to scam people. They purposely make it confusing and provide little record on your account actions whether you cancelled or not,Yes
I thought there were to many commercials. They play three different ones 3 or 4 times in a row.,Yes
I thought it was free but its a pay for service,Yes
"My husband subscribed to watch Racing: motorcycle, F1, etc.  We are both very tech savvy, but he found this interface to be very difficult to navigate.  We called to cancel, and were charged for 2 months. We realized this error when we got an √¢??insufficient fund√¢?¬ù notice from our CC company while trying to pay a bill. FUBO snuck through a $60 charge and caused us to be short of our payment by $20. Massive chain reaction of bullshit has been following us ever since... and, we√¢??re on vacation trying to deal with all this. Not to mention the fact that all our money is in limbo, again, while on vacation.FUBO customer service is a joke. Everyone was 100% unhelpful. Took 3 reps to get a supervisor who reluctantly refunded one month.I highly recommend everyone avoids FUBO like the plague, and goes to watch live sporting events in a bar, like an adult.",Yes
"I won't post my entire experience however there is a detailed review on both trustpilot and the BBB.  The most important thing from my experience to be careful about:1,  Don't let them put you in a loop towards the end of your trial .  I canceled after 1 hour and still was put into that loop where you will get replies to emails where the goal may be to run out the clock on the 7 days.2.  VERY IMPORTANT - They will tell you that you have to cancel through the app, and that was easy enough to do. but thank god I didn't hit yes , i confirm I want to cancel, and look away from the screen as it went back to their home page.  A statement that really blended in with everything else and was only on for a second or two said that my cancellation was not successful.  This is where I knew it was a scam.  It should have given me an error when I hit that confirm button and not let me cancel or I should have gotten and email generated by the system stating that my cancellation was not successful and to please contact customer service.  Of course neither thing happened.  I can only imagine how many people have hit that button and looked away, went to a different tab quickly, or just didn't notice the hard to notice or because it was so fast thought it said that their cancellation was, instead was not, successful.If you are reading this before signing up with these people, unlike me, Don't!  Run and don't look back.And if you know you canceled through the app within the 7 days and still got billed, you are not crazy rather you were scammed.If you do cancel through customer service ask for a confirmation email and if you don't have one within 15 minutes call back.  I received my almost immediately.Hope this helps someone either get the money they were scammed back or prevents someone getting taken in the first place.",Yes
"It seems Fubo has missed the point of the  cord-cutting ""targeted streaming content service"" trend. Or, at least, they want you to think it's cord cutting. Unlike NFL, NBA and MLB apps that offer the user the ability to focus on just the content they are after (baseball, hockey, US football), Fubo delivers packages of fairly low bandwidth sports streams that force you to channel surf in order to find the content you're looking for. (Let's face it, there are hundreds, if not thousands of football matches going on around the world all year long),The truth is, when you're forced to buy bundled packages that resemble what you are already paying for with traditional ""cable tv"", you've just exchanged one cord for another. For most people, internet and standard cabe tv use the same physical wire to the house. Using Fubo to stream the same channels means you are actually using a SLOWER (lower bandwidth & quality) stream to watch the same channels in lower quality. PLUS you are paying for the additional data/bandwidth usage that goes against your monthly allotment...- And before Fubo says ""but you can watch on computer or mobile device""; most cable providers already offer mobile apps or web access to live channels. Most major networks already offer mobile/web access to streaming content if you can prove you have a traditional cable tv contract. (NBC/ABC/FOX/SKY etc..) - So (MAYBE) Fubo has missed the point on cord cutting and targeted streaming, (MAYBE) Fubo knows but wants people to think it's a cable/cord killer service, or (MAYBE) Fubo is an initiative sponsored by a major cable company to rope former customers into a service that, at it's core, is exactly what people are trying to get away from or already paying for.NOTE to Fubo: The point of targeted steaming apps is to allow customers to pay for ONLY the channels they use. HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, Mhz, MLB,, Netflix, Amazon Prime all do this very well.. So if Fubo REALLY want to impress customers, they will figure out a way to corral all of the network relationships they've made into apps or options within their app that allow customers to purchase focused content like EPL, Europa League, Bundesliga League, specific team matches or cup competitions without the need to channel surf and slog through irrelevant content to find the content they're seeking. Otherwise, there's really no point. The content is available elsewhere. Sometimes for free.",Yes
Have had FuboTV for 6mos and I have no issues other than a few hiccups on streaming occasional. What they need to fix is their commercial programming. I have contacted them about having to watch & listen to the Dr. Dre Beats headphone commercial at every commercial break since January. The song being played is very annoying and having to hear it every 5 - 10 min is noxious at best. Their tech support weiner replied back quickly but said they have no control over the commercial programming I call B.S. as I checked multiple channels and that obnoxious commercial is being run on all of them. The next new commercial just arrived from Chili's. I won't buy Beat headphones and I won't go to Chili's just because you drive your message at me every 10min.,Yes
"After trialing FuboTV for a week I chose to cancel.  The sports content was very good (for international sports), and the content of movies and tv programs was pretty good.  My main complaints were: 1. while I could save or record movies soon to be aired on individual networks, I did not see a way to save those that were on demand, meaning that each time I wanted to watch an on demand movie I would need to do a new search through all movies.  Being able to save movies to a favorites list would have been a very good option.  2. TV programs I liked could be saved, or recorded.  There was then a list created of all of the programs I was following, which was great.  What wasn√¢??t great was that the list only displayed 20 shows or recordings, which means that after I spent my time going through everything offered on Fubo and saving or recording the content I was interested in, the majority of it was saved, but not searchable as only 20 items were kept in the list.  Very frustrating! Again, good content, but the delivery of that content and the difficulty in identifying something to watch was why I cancelled.Customer service: canceling within the trial period was a challenge, but eventually the monthly charge I incurred as a result of not being able to easily cancel was fully refunded, and I thank Fubo for that.  Unfortunately, it took way too much time, effort, aggravation, and unfortunate negative reviews to make that happen.  After getting the runaround for several days I was finally contacted by a woman who took care of the problem in a matter of seconds.  Had it been a strait forward process from the beginning, and if Fubo cleans up the customer service issues I experienced it would be a very good service for a lot of people, just not for me.",Yes
"I got fubo specifically to watch the World Series.  But after creating an account, profile, et al, I was finally able to find the game in the list of programs.  But when I click on it, the screen goes black and it gives me this message:""This Match is available in 4k.  But it looks like this device doesn't support 4k resolution.  Visit fubo.tv/4k for a list of supported devices and browsers.""OK, it's *available* in 4k, but can I watch it in whatever k my tv has?  Apparently not!  And not my laptop either!  My laptop is barely a year old and my tv is maybe a couple years old, and yet their technology is not enough to show fubo's ONLY way to show the game??  It feels insulting to tell me to go to their website to see what devices it works on.  Like I'm going to buy a new TV and laptop just to be able to watch this unreliable channel!  Instead of fubo finding a way to play on my device, they tell me to find a device that will play fubo.  Ridiculous.",Yes
"I cancelled (or at least thought i did) my Fubo TV service and noticed that months later i'm still being charged.  Researching the internet this appears to be a problem with Fubo.  Once you click the cancel button on your account page, a survey page pops up and then you have to click 'confirm cancellation' or your service will not be cancelled.  I'm positive I performed this step the first time I cancelled because I had to go back into my account a week later to confirm exactly when our service would be discontinued.  Unfortunately, I don't have confirmation from FUBO that I cancelled.  I've cancelled again and this time taken a screenshot verifying when my service will end.  I still have not recieved an email from FUBO confirming my cancellation.",Yes
Thought when I recorded event I could FF stuff I didn't want to watch. You CANNOT FF - so what's the point of recording??I will definitely CANCEL after my free trial period.  I don't want to watch all the French Open tennis matches I recorded. If I still had Cable-TV I would FF to the specific matches I want to see.Really stupid to have DVR recording option offered to customers when they have NO CONROL with their recordings!!!,Yes
"I had Fubo for maybe 6 or 7 months. It was buggy, the stream would get choppy or freeze regularly, and I didn√¢??t have ESPN. Oh well, I thought. $45 a month is still worth it. That is, until receiving an additional $26 charge for no apparent reason that they refused to refund me. That is stealing so I cancelled my subscription and it√¢??s doubtful that I will ever have any business with them ever again.",Yes
"We were looking for a way to watch some sports games and came across FuboTV so we thought we'd give the free trial a shot. This service is horrible. It stops working constantly, like every two minutes. We missed most big plays of the game we were watching. When it comes back it's blurry and pixely and will work correctly for a couple of minutes and then goes out again. After the free trial it's $25/month for the first month and then $40 after that but this service is not worth that price.",Yes
Signed up for the 7 day trial and cancelled after the 1st day. Something happened with the browser on my phone while cancelling. I thought it went through and they charged me two more times. Not worth it at all,Yes
I didn't get any heads up about the change in channels and charges until today when changes take place... I will be cancelling my service that wasn't all the great to begin with!!!! We don't get any appreciation!!!,Yes
Didn't get it way too much money my cable is cheaper and has more channels I thought it was free filled me,Yes
i thought it was free,Yes
"This app is virtually useless. Primary detractions:1. Playback is unreliable in quality and seamlessness.  This is not a problem I have with other apps. Every 20 seconds or-so I get a yellow 'buffering' loop that takes 20 more seconds to return to streaming (now at substantially decreased quality). My internet speed is fine--and, oddly enough, provided by NBC's parent company.2. Commercials cut into programming. I got the app to watch the 2018 Olympics and it cuts into live competition to show ads. It might be tolerable (but shouldn't happen at all) if it was a rare fluke; but it isn't. It happens every couple minutes; absolutely ruining the watching experience.3. The commercial-to-program ratio is something like 2:1. I am spending twice as much time watching commercials as I am programming.I can only surmise that NBC really doesn't want one to actually use this to enjoy their programming.",Yes
"If you're getting an error when opening the app, or loading content, you can't have any ad blockers active.  Bypass your PIHole, remove ad blockers from computer, whatever. That fixes the problem.As for the app, it sucks. The ads are as every 1-star review describes, constant, unrelenting, and repetitive. Hockey games aren't so bad, but the Olympics were terrible.  Needing a subscription is expected, but a cable account is ridiculous. Just give a non-cable cutter friend or family a few bucks and use their account. The app is slow and sluggish. Just have to deal with that.  I would say use every means necessary to circumvent the traditional ""Pay us to watch, watch our advertising, and we'll black out what we want"" mentality of the networks. There are lots of options out there. The sooner everyone ditches the status quo and hits their pocketbooks, the sooner they'll revamp the pay structure to get customers back.Cancel Netflix.",Yes
"It did work great before NBCSN decided they wanted to push this gold sub package and new app version. Ever since I cant stream the content clearly using the firestick, constantly buffering and out of focus. Same content streams flawless on my pc and apple tv legacy (3rd gen). So its the app on the firestick that is the issue. I hope it gets fixed. Really disappointing app right now, makes streaming racing in my office or game room a non-starter. Its not my bandwidth with a 500 MB UL/DL connection and flawless 4k from Disney, Amazon Prime video, and Netflix. The video issues are all with the app that has been updated and pushed to the firestick. The firestick does many things well, but this app is not one of them. I dont know how much control they have over it but if I could roll back to the original version of the app I would.Just fix it.",Yes
"Purchased a √¢??sport pass√¢?? for a competition only screened in the US by NBC SportsGold. With no alternative way of watching my choice was either purchase the pack or not watch the games. Pricing is outrageous for what is screened for free in every other country of the world. The live stream in the six nations rugby I was watching is good (as it comes from the U.K.) but abruptly stops at half time to be replaced by strange wind like noises around the empty stadium. To watch events like the the rugby World Cup in the US you have the choice as a consumer to not watch, or pay monopoly pricing.The APP is best started 10-15 minutes prior to kick off as thesecurity features are apt to have changed requiring swift log-ins on an actual computer (not a phone) to reauthorise what you have already paid for. This is consistent with the monopoly pricing - they don√¢??t want you sharing log-in details. But it also means it√¢??s tough to watch across multiple devices even when you have paid for the privilege.",Yes
"tthis has been the worst coverage of the Olympics ever!  I've been watching for 62 years and I should know.  I started taping the program about 25 years ago, and it used to be action packed.  It was all about the athletes and there sport and accomplishments.  Now they spend more time on themselves (the so called news readers)  I can't even call them journalists.  the show nothing but commercials (6-7) when they break.  And the segments that they do on each other is a joke.  How many times do I have to endure Johnny Weir and Tara discussing their frigging wardrobe.  I'm sorry but this is still a program that is ; or at least it used to be; seen by families with kids.  Don't you think they have some questions about Johnny wearing his lipstick nd rouge...not to mention the hair obsession.  You never know what your going to get when you tune to a NBS (SC) station.  I have yet to see one thing that is complete.  AND WHERE ARE THE MEDAL CEREMONIES????  Where is Bob Costas when you need him, and Mary.  The little skating lessons given by Scott Hamilton and Tahinan is just plain stupid.  If they continue this way I won't be watching again.  How sad!",Yes
"If you still have the NBC Gold app, keep it for awhile. For two weeks I've tried to watch a subscription *I paid for* and it wasn't available. I opened the ""old"" Gold app and there it was. And the old app remembered my so I didn't have to log in everytime. This one keeps making me authenticate. And as for authentication, how's this flow: scan a barcode, be taken to a website to enter a code, and what's that get you? A login screen. Why not just give me the login screen to begin with. And btw, that's not to say the Gold app was gold, it had plenty of issues, but I wanted to think they'd put some thought into a ""new"" app before asking customers to switch.Update: Edit to one star, this just gets worse and worse and they don't care.",Yes
"No, I'm not being sarcastic.  Lots of people are confused because this app has NBC in the name, so please allow me to clarify.  The NBC Sports app is the streaming app for the NBC-owned cable sports channels like NBCSN, Golf Channel, etc.  It's no different than other apps for cable sports channels like ESPN.  Generally speaking, the only ""free"" sports you will find on network TV anymore are NFL games.  In my area (St. Paul), the local MLB, NBA, and NHL teams are all broadcast on regional sports networks (RSNs), which are only available through a cable TV package.  Every now and then you might find a Sunday matinee on network TV for the Wild (NBC) or T-Wolves (ABC), but 99% of the time it's on cable.  So yes, you need to have a subscription to stream it.The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because the frame rate is only 30 fps.  Sports are generally broadcast in 60 fps for better picture quality during fast action.  ESPN and Fox Sports both offer 60 fps, but NBC Sports is still only 30 fps.  What gives, NBC?  It's 2019!  Get your act together!",Yes
"Needs work. You can't fast forward or rewind streams using. When you try to fast forward, the app isn't recognizing the the button pressess on the remote. The app just starts blinking. Often it doesn't recognize the remote control at all. I use mostly for EPL replays, one, the location of highlights means you have to avert your eyes for spoilers. The titles are often spoilers. Replays should be a the top. Spoiler headings should be eliminated altogether like ""Zlatan puts United ahead."" Just title it ""X v. Y highlights""  The exact same thing plagued the app during the olympics. Not that i care about olympics as this is about the app when it isn't Olympic mode. Sometimes a soccer game will resume where you left off sometimes it doesn't. There is no discernible pattern.A huge problem is often EPL soccer matches are not added to the app in a timely fashion. The game can end and it can be a day or two before it's available. Forcing you to illegal means to get the game shortly after it ends. Worse you can often log on on the phone and see that the game is actually listed for streaming.Note: I have the app on Roku too and it has the exact same issue as the layout is almost identical.Understand this:1. The app is requires you have a cable subscription. It is NOT a substitute cable service. It's not free.2. This is for the NBC Sports Channel (a cable teir sports channel) NOT broadcast NBC channel (the basic channel)",Yes
"This app is terrible. I cannot find any way to turn on closed captioning. The playback controls are basically worthless. While watching the NHL West Final, I paused the game and intended to fast forward during the commercial break to catch up. Turns out it is impossible to rewind or fast forward. Ended up missing two goals when we went back to the live game.",Yes
"Had a challenge downloading to the IPAD. When I was on the phone with support they walked me thru the process. (Thank you!) I asked about compatibility with TIVO and was told ""sure...no problem"" I was later informed by TIVO, nope and probably not going to happen. I was watching the President's Cup Golf Match. With about 2 hours remaining in the event and the match all tied...They ended the broadcast. WHAT IS THE POINT. I had to wait 12 hours after the event to watch it on NBC Network.  One last comment, if this is live streaming...why so many commercials? I honestly think there were fewer on the network airing.",Yes
"We purchased NBC Sports so we could watch the Olympics.  There are only about 2 weeks of this special event and then another 4 years wait till the next set of Winter Olympics.  We wanted to indulged! Since NBC owns the broadcasting rights to the Olympics, this seemed like a smart, simple purchase.  We quickly learned this was neither smart or simple.  'Error' resulted in missing what was supposed to be ice skating when the programming froze for more than 20 minutes.  Morning televised programs are aired again later in the day.  (102 events people!!! Why replay the SAME ones?!?!). And in some random competition with itself, NBC will show one event on NBC Sports and a completely different event on NBC...So, I can watch what I paid for or watch what is free through my TV antennae.  ???  There 92 nations competing in 102 events, and preliminaries to some of those events, and semifinals for some of those events...It thought I would be able to see all of the Olympics with this purchase.  Clearly, I was mistaken.",Yes
"Frustrating site.  I watch live F1 and IndyCar when I can.  I try to watch Full Event Replays if I miss the live.  The site controls are balky.  Sort by sport 1) doesn't always work, 2) doesn't stick through struggles to find the event.  If play can be successfully accomplished, the stream is generally smooth (Occasionally hangs for buffering, and I'm cable hardwired!) and the picture quality is good once the stream is established.  It can be awkward but it's the best that formula motorsport fans have got.  For that we're appreciative.  Perhaps more awareness that followers are more likely to employ their PC or smart TV rather than a phone and seek out the replay to watch the process rather than simply the result, would lead to improved/better optimized site for such consumption.",Yes
"I downloaded for Olympics coverage on my Fire TV Stick. Live events are easily found, but locating link to completed events can be a challenge because you have to scroll through as many as 300 events/highlights (so far) to find the one you want to see√¢??there is no search tool. Quality of streaming is not outstanding, but most full events as well as excerpts of interviews and short features seem to be available if you look long/hard enough.As a side note, I initially had difficulty activating the app on my PC; clicking the ""activate"" link in my browser failed to go to my carrier's website, which was required for final activation. However, that seemed to be a browser issue. When I switched to another browser with extensions not loaded, activation went smoothly.",Yes
"I only watch motor sports on this channel and am tired of the excessive ads and the poor graphics.  They continuously put advertising on the ""ticker tape"" standings bar and then start the ticker tape over again and you can't see what is going on in the back of the pack.  The commentators are incapable of tracking back markers that make significant progress during the race and only focus on the top 5 or so performers.  During the recent Bristol races the ads ran so long you missed significant parts of the race.  With all their camera coverage, they frequently can't adequately show incidents on the track.Also, they don't allow enough time for an event and change channels without any notification making it almost impossible to DVR anything.  I thought Fox Sports was bad, but NBC Sports is really terrible coverage and their arbitrarily changing channels is a huge hassle.",Yes
"Unfortunately all of the sports that NBC has purchased are trapped behind this incredibly frustrating app. I√¢??ve used it for years now, and I would guess I√¢??ve been asked to authorize the app more than 50 times. Netflix, Hulu, heck even crackle aren√¢??t constantly prompting for logins.Browsing a program is also difficult. Of course I don√¢??t expect to fast forward through commercials, but seeking a point in a replay is done by skipping ahead 10 seconds at a time. It does feature a seek function by pausing and fast forwarding, but that doesn√¢??t work.If it worked as designed it would be outstanding, but as seems to be the theme with the traditional networks, it doesn√¢??t. I√¢??m excited for the day Netflix picks up the Premier League and Amazon the NFL.",Yes
"Great...watched the entire Super Bowl on my Firestick without one second of ""buffering"" no skips, no delays and in HD. I've noticed a lot of negative reviews. There was mention of staring at the screen with a logo and the words something along the lines of ""we'll be back in a moment"". The first time it happened I thought that it was buffering; so not to miss anything I switched to cable TV and the game was not being played at that particular moment anyway. Those of you who have submitted negative reviews for this App should look for a problem with your setup, Not the App..... because as the old Chinese saying goes ""sum ting wong""",Yes
"This is an excellent app that I use on my Fire TV stick.  It streams all sorts of great action like Soccer and other sports.  The fact that it's legit and free are such a great combo.  The streaming is flawless so there's no buffering or anything.  The quality is outstanding as well.I was originally disappointed when English Premier League soccer went off Fox.  But I'm finding the NBC broadcasts to be just as good if not better.If you're a soccer fan like I am, get this app.  You won't be sorry.",Yes
"I've rated this app poorly mostly due to terrible streaming performance. How I came to use this app and my experience is as follows: I recently gave traditional cable the boot and have been using PlayStation VUE for TV service. The most recent NASCAR race was not available on the NBCSN channel but was available through this app. I was curious how well this app would work for a live sporting event and decided to give it a shot. I searched for the app via Fire TV's universal search and was able to find it with ease. Upon installation you have to go through an activation process that requires you to prove you have a cable, or similar, provider; this is not unlike many other pay tv channel applications. Once I completed activation, via a computer, the app was instantly accessible. The interface is sparse yet straightforward and I was able to quickly find the race and stream it. Unfortunately, it would stream for about 5 minutes then pause and show a buffering icon, there was no way to get the content to continue streaming without restarting. Upon restart everything worked properly again... ...for about five minutes and then everything froze. I repeated this process four times with the same result. My Fire TV's WiFi signal is listed as, ""very good,"" and other streaming services I use (Netflix, PlayStation VUE) worked fine. I was excited to give this application a try, but don't see it as a viable option for watching live content at this point.  I plan to test it again at some point and see if the experience changes.",Yes
"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01923M8T6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_31I like being able to have the sports news, but I wish there was more options on watching live sporting events.  When I purchased this app I thought there were more live options than the highlight reels.",Yes
"This reviews deserves ZERO stars, but I think I must post at least one!!This has been a HUGE disappointment!! We went through our Dish connection -- which took two days and many trials.The coup de grace was last night... We were trying to replay/watch the mens' figure skating final.  The transmission would go from high def to low web and back again.But the best part was when we got to about the 2 hour appoint of the 4.5 hour program! The transmission would suddenly show ""end of program""!! So we had to start from the beginning, fast forward to the point where we were, watch more (typically 5 - 10 min), the program would ""end"" again, and ou little game would start over! After 20 - 30 trials of this my wife and I gave up on NBC. That's it for us and this winter Olympics!Oh! And I am sure someone will say we have a bad internet connection, right? Well, we tried this over at least three separate connections over several days, so our adventures last night were not unique!",Yes
"This app gets 5 stars from me as it supports activation with a PlayStation Vue account. Typically services like these ONLY support traditional cable/satellite TV services, so being able to activate with PSVue is great for cord-cutters like us.This is especially useful as in our area, PS Vue does not have live NBC streaming yet, only NBC On Demand, so we can not yet watch live NBC broadcast sports through PS Vue. But since the NBC Sports app still supports our activation, and during the Olympics, that has been a life saver.",Yes
"Liked: good camera focus, comments and background of players.Disliked: Way too much advertising, too many interruptions. Got really boring, and worst of all I  could not stop it, thought the system had a glitch, had to wait till the whole download finished playing. I wanted to watch the men's  hockey match and ended up with Japanese girls playing curling, really? Not exactly what I was interested in.",Yes
"I thought I would be able to get this using my Fire Stick and my HD antenna. Unfortunately it does not. It requires me to have some sort of cable or satellite service that I pay for. I√¢??m very unhappy about this! I got the NBC SN when I had satellite, and the point is to eliminate that expense!",Yes
"Not long enough selective coverage on the golf channel should be able to choose what I want to watch, hard to see what√¢??s coming up joined because I wanted to watch certain players and thought that would go through the whole tournament not so",Yes
I only watch Supercross and between any action there is just a constant shot of the track with no commentary. It would make it more entertaining if you ran a commercial or anything other than nothing.,Yes
"Since we are all banned from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway this year, NBCSG at least brings much of the action to the flat screen. Worth 40 bucks?  When the alternative is being ignorant about the teams and cars come race day, I went for it.",Yes
"This was one of the weakest strems I've paid for. Usability was a challenge. When it stopped showing the main competition, it went to still shots and it was hard to know where things were in the competition next. There was only background sound. The interface was very large on the best of equipment, even with commercial internet from my business. When Supercross went to NBC with this program it lost a lot of viewers and I understand why.",Yes
"This app is junk. What is this some kind of dumb protest by NBC against people who choose to stream their entertainment? What does it matter if I watch commercials via traditional means or streaming over the internet? We got to watch a whopping 10 minutes of Olympic events and 20 minutes of commercials when it was working before it prompted us to activate and provide our internet provider details. NBC, why do you care how I internet?!",Yes
"I wanted to watch curling.  It was 50/50 with curling and commercials.  I expected a better break on the sports action, but was dissatisfied.  Additionally, they did not pause the action for the commercials, just blanked out a portion of the on court activities to present the commercial break",Yes
I tried to watch a Nascar race when logged in with a provider account.  It kept telling me that my parental controls would not allow me to watch.  They were all turned off.  The app absolutely did not work for me at all.,Yes
picture is good but the video is jumpy. It may be my connection speed. If connection speed updates are too expensive then companies that want their products used need to develop ways to improve video at lower speeds. ISP's are going to own the internet if they can control the speed of the internet.,Yes
"The NBC Sports for FIRETV app stability could be improved by a lot. Although the video quality is amazing, the stream often drops and almost every time after an ad, the app just crashes an goes back to the beginning of video out of nowhere. This could get very annoying when this happens over and over again. I would give the app 5 star without doubt if the app was not crashing so frequently after fast forwarding or advertisement.",Yes
"This one did not solve the problem. When I could get anything on my firestick, it was analysis. I went to see some of the action at a friend's hoouse, and gave up.",Yes
"Downloaded to watch the Olympic swimming trials. Says that there is a parental control lock on it. There are no parental control locks on my firestick account, the tv, or my cable account. Useless.",Yes
"Practically no control on rewind/ff. No understandable difference between x/2x/3x. For certain x is not 1/2 the time skipped in 2x. No time code at the bottom. Absolute junk. Cuts to app commercials in the middle of important events, no consideration for the sport itself or the viewer.",Yes
"10/27/2017 Installed latest version to see if it makes any difference. The new version obliterated any hope for a better app. Gone is a simple categorization of sport. Now you have to search through 80 replays all thrown together. Soccer next to football next to racing...who's the idiot who thinks this is better?It's now choppier than ever. I've cleared cache, deleted apps, restart my firetv numerous times, rebooted my router, even turned off every device on our network and still cuts out 1 second of every 8 to 10 seconds of  replay broadcast.  AWFUL!10/23/16: an hour later, while the USGP Race was on, I had come back inside to watch something else, and as the screen refreshed...there it was...So I watched the second half of the race live...will need to go back and watch the start later.10/23/16:  Today, the day of the USGP F1, the app now doesn't have the Live Event for today's USGP nor does it have the replay of Qualifying (watched it live yesterday).  Not sure what goes on behind the scenes, but this has been the trend all year...we on the viewer side call it annoying/flaky/unreliable...among our colorful turretic episodes...This App is awesome!  Replay live events you missed, Great extra insight presentations!  This is awesome!Old Post @900 am 06/17/2016...rated 1 star at the time...they fixed within 6 hours!:Liked this app until near two weeks ago.  F1 episodes that are broadcast on television do not play.  Error message 'Parental Controls prohibit this from being viewed'...I have verified there are no Parental Setting on by FireStick.  Spoke with Amazon Tech Support...they verified it was not a credential issue. Episodes that are Practice 1 & 3 play fine...Practice 2, Qualifying, and the Race itself (even re-broadcast...and live events) do not play.  HEY NBC Sports...is this tied to a rating on the broadcast at all???  Is there some category, G, PG, NR, etc that is not being applied...anything of value (and what the sponsors want us to see) are not able to be viewed.",Yes
"I thought I would be able to use this with my FireStick, but in order to watch anything, you have to have provider access.  We rely solely on our FireStick and Sling subscriptions, so was disappointed this app didn't even have a pay feature like CBS All Access.",Yes
I thought I could watch the basic TV channel for FREE via an app through firestick Amazon for some Sunday Night FootballFirst thing is this app wanted a monthly plan 50$plusNoThanks I don't have time nor money for something that is supposed to be FREE,Yes
Its ok for the price but we thought there would be more races on from around where we live in Pa,Yes
"What NBC is doing here is streaming endless repetitions of the same commercials, interrupted by occaisional bits of Olympic action. Just one example: I was watching a women's fencing bout, and instead of seeing the winning touch (in OT no less) I got a Jeep commercial! Coverage returned to the winner celebrating. For me, NBC's streaming is unwatchable.",Yes
"I wanted to watch the Olympics sports that I had missed, but this didn't do that.  I thought they would recap the days events had passed, it didn't.  It might do that now that Olympics is over, but I've moved on to other things.",Yes
Got this to watch the rugby world cup.  Thought it was pricey but worth it,Yes
"If SUCKS had an app, it would be NBC Sports. Worst app I've ever seen start to finish. It starts with a dopey video pushing how you can catch all the action from the RIO OLYMPICS??? Then it crashes on everything if you're not on a google product??? Horrendous waste of time.",Yes
"A broadcast station of which is encompassing lots of news, gameplay and the format for live sports action.",Yes
"I got this app for the Olympics and was happy to be able to pick and choose the events I wanted to watch.Pro√¢??s: Pick and choose the events you want to watch, even after the Olympics!Con√¢??s:  Need to link to a provider.  We already have Verizon so it was easy, but I would be frustrated if not and feel the pain for those that would otherwise benefit from this app.  Load time is pretty slow, in a high speed world it feels like dial up-but worth the wait.Would I purchase again?  I would use this app again for sure.  I am still using it!  Slowly we are catching up with all the events that were not on prime time.  If the app worked without linking it to a service provider it would be GREAT!I hope to provide my own input on products in order to help others as well. The contents of my review are 100% my own opinions and experiences with the product.  I only give ratings that I think the product deserves. I am completely, 100% truthful in my reviews and I reserve the right to modify my thoughts if I ever come upon a change in my experience of using the product. I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please click the YES button or the HELPFUL button if your using the mobile app√¢?¬¶If you have any questions at all, please ask and I will try to answer to the best of my ability.",Yes
I only got highlights of the cycling race.  I thought I was recording the entire race.  Somewhat disappointed.,Yes
Thought it was a free app but wasnt so i uninstalled.,Yes
Thought this was something else but whatever,Yes
"Pretty ridiculous to only allow five minutes of free viewing per day. We don't have pay TV anymore, just use a digital receiver and thought, 'oh cool we can watch the other sports online like we used to in the past.' no such luck, and to add insult to injury they also show advertisements before the event which eats into the five minutes they give you.",Yes
"Repeated buffering of live stream and it would repeat portions of the broadcast, then skip ahead. Also it was difficult to know where you were in the broadcast if you paused it because there are no visible playback controls",Yes
"Very frustrating. Reboots frequently, particularly when attempting to access highlight videos.  Very spotty quantity of videos, some have absolutely no commentary and the graphics are impenetrable. Fast forward doesn't work, so you can't skip to the action on replays. And the commercials pop up at random intervals, sometimes within 20 sec of the last. Generally this is a very poor experience, and entirely unacceptable way to explore sports with which you aren't familiar.",Yes
If I could give -2 stars I would. This app NEVER works. You can pay what amount of money to host NFL games but you can't pay a fraction of that money to fix your app????????,Yes
I downloaded this app because I thought it would be a way to watch the Kentucky Derby live.  You can watch it with the app provided that you have cable which I do not.  If I had cable then I wouldn't need the app.  Some sports apps will allow you to purchase a subscription without having cable...NBC does not.  Typical of NBC.,Yes
"Don√¢??t care for this channel. Thought i could watch  my state college football games , which is  Ga  bulldogs. But couldn√¢??t , they wanted my credit card number , not interested in giving out my credit card to everyone. If I could find something through amazon to purchase air time for college football I would.",Yes
My mistake...I thought this app would include NBC Sports Gold.  I did not realize it is a separate app with a fee.,Yes
"Misleading. I thought I could watch live sports through amazon. Turns out you need a cable subscription.If you already have cable, you don√¢??t  need the app. If you need an app to watch sports because you don√¢??t have cable, this won√¢??t help you.",Yes
"I was totally disaapointed with it.  The reason I signed up for it was I thought we could access the Golf channel 224 (in my area) but turned out I could not. Fed up with paying high cost of Optimum. In order to get the Golf  channel , I  am forced to subscribe to the highest package .",Yes
I get an error code for parental controls. But it doesn't let me change parental controls anywhere. Disappointed that I always fight with this app.,Yes
"Overall my wife and I thought the Olympic production wasn't as good as previous Olympics on NBC.Just a bit off, so to speak.",Yes
I was just wonder why the code for viewing something? I thought it is free for each one to see the sporting games but why make it confusing just to get see the game and sometimes a lot f time wasted just to remember your code.,Yes
"I got it, no problem loading or anything, but as soon as I went to watch a live game it said my parental controls won't let me watch it. But I don't have any parental controls on any of my devices because I don't need them. I went on my Amazon fire stick to make sure my controls were off and they were! Don't know where to go from here....",Yes
"The app itself seems to work fine.  However, to use it beyond a 30 trial period, you have to have some kind of cable/satellite package that includes NBC.  I disagree with this as a business model, but if they want to do that, it's fine, they just do not make that clear when you are choosing these apps.",Yes
Our local NBC channel is off the air due to a dispute with the provider. I was able to get the Monday night football game streaming for my husband! He thought I was a rock star!!! So great!,Yes
"I watched part of the first round of the Schwab Challenge.  Commercials streamed fine but the golf coverage was very fuzzy, dropped audio and inconsistent.",Yes
"Thought I could watch the Stanley cup, nascar etc with ease but streaming is terrible!",Yes
Has potential. Keeps giving error about parental controls being set wrong. I have them turned off? Needs some updates.,Yes
could only access it for 28 minutes then asked for subscription. My mistake I thought it came with being a Prime member. Guess not. Finding Amazon Prime is not giving it's member access to a lot of programing.,Yes
Gotta have cable or direct tv provider to use the app. What's the purpose of having an app if you need a cable provider. I thought the point of apps was to get away from cable & direct tv.,Yes
i thought the NBCSN GOLD app allowed for Premier League soccer access to the games on NBCSN GOLD via my Amazon Prime membership.  it doesnt.,Yes
"Was generally good, but were numerous caching/buffering pauses and at times video played but at low resolution, high population...thought I was back in days of cathode ray tubes and rabbit ears.Hope it improves during Olympic broadcast... May with lesser simultaneous streamers.",Yes
"I wanted to watch the olympics instead they show bits and pieces, not what I thought it would be",Yes
If I could give this app 0 star's it would still be too much. I understand nothing is free but the greed displayed for the basic things in life is completely out of control.,Yes
Not what I thought it was,Yes
When the amazon app purchase came through I thought it meant I had access through Amazon - didn't know I still needed cable to stream.  What's the point of downloading the app through my fire stick if that's the case?,Yes
Everything you want to see your worth seeing you have to pay for it I thought you would at least get some kind of games for free what's the point of downloading and I've been using it if you have to pay for everything nothing is live,Yes
"A few issues with buffering, but that was probably my connection. That being said I never lost any of the action.",Yes
Thought it came with Amazon. You need to purchase this app to stream,Yes
Interaction is sluggish and not that user friendly. Not all games that I thought would be there are there...especially for the price I'm paying for it. Could be improved drastically.,Yes
Its a good app just didn't use it as much as I thought.,Yes
I thought I would be able to get all the philly football games but it turns out that you can only see the pre/post games. I guess the philly package is just a name,Yes
I watched the Patriots versus Kansas City last night only to realize that the game I thought I was watching live was already over when my ESPN app on my phone showed the score.  I was absolutely disappointed to find that out when my NBC Sports app showed 9 minutes left in the game when I received my ESPN update.,Yes
"I thought I was going to see replay of The Tour de France, any time after it was transmitted live, so it has not made a difference,it appears I can not stream it at any time after it was live.",Yes
"Only able to watch highlights.  Wanted cable access to watch competitions.  Being an app on Fire, I thought it would allow me to watch live or at the least recorded competitions.",Yes
Thought I was going to have a lot of options by downloading this but unfortunately you only get it for 25 minutes and have to constantly put in a code. So I will not be using that app. Nobody likes to have to do that every 25 minutes just to watch something,Yes
I thought I was buying an app/service that would allow me to watch golf tournaments.  This app doesnt allow you to see all days of the tournaments. In some case you can only see select holes.  This means that you won√¢??t be following the tournament leaders.,Yes
The app has severe control latency issues.  It ignores the command of the remote completely.  Very much unlike my apple TV operation with the same application.  Probably a Fire TV interaction with the app issue since the app is trying to force me to watch an add before every selection I make. During the add the remote is effectively dead.,Yes
"Only works if you already have cable or satellite, in which case I would not need to stream content.Wake up network providers!  The traditional distribution model is dying.",Yes
"Not what I thought it was, want to cancel",Yes
"Downloaded this to my Fire, didnt know it was only a trial, shut me off right when my friend was participating in the Olympics  so I missed his whole run!!!!  Thought I  had it covered, not very happy let me tell you!!!",Yes
"What I liked most was the thought of watching the Olympics. What I liked least was I couldn't just stream them over my wifi, so I was not able to.",Yes
I thought this was a free app. But was highly disappointed they want cable provider when I just wanted what would be publically broadcasted. I wouldn't recommend  app. Sorry√∞??? thumbs down for me!,Yes
This app is complete junk. I downloaded it so I could watch the Olympics and all I get is auth errors and it won't allow me to access any of videos. I am really upset that I thought this would be a quality product and it was a waste of time.,Yes
"I am unable to get logged into the account. Either it won√¢??t take my password or email, or I√¢??m not understanding what it√¢??s asking for. I√¢??m very frustrated.",Yes
"Remove NBC sports, I thought I would be able to watch a game on NBC",Yes
Saw the advertisement for Olympics on FireTV and thought I'd try.  This was nothing but pure commercials with just a few minutes of events.  Shut it off after 5 minutes and don't plan to use it again.,Yes
I thought I would be able to watch Monday and Thursday night football. All I get is people talking about the games. Don√¢??t like it at all,Yes
"This app is pretty mediocre. The commercials cut in randomly and interrupt the event right in the middle of the action, even on replay. You also can't rewind which is very annoying.",Yes
Shame on NBC....Prematurely launched this app.My husband was set to watch The British Open...but many streams are blocked by Parental Control messages. (We have NO controls set up). Spent an hour and a half with Amazon Fire TV tech support-they are amazing!!!!!!  But still unable to watch live streams.Very disappointing.,Yes
I thought everything was good. Very easy to access and a great picture.,Yes
I could not watch it because my provider has blacked it out under my subscription. I thought I would be able to use this under my subscription with Amazon?,Yes
Not what I thought it would be.,Yes
"App is incredibly glitchy. Watching live games is completely unreliable as it will constantly cut back to scenes that occurred about 10 seconds ago, and then jump right back to the live action. NBC really needs to update this app.",Yes
Thought the app was free with Amazon Fire.... turns out you have to have an internet provider to continue to use it after a brief sampling. :-(,Yes
I thought I was going to be able to watch the Olympic coverage all you were able to watch for highlights what a bummer,Yes
Didn't watch as much as we thought we would.,Yes
It was my understanding that the service was free but it was only free for a limited time.,Yes
This WAS a great app.Not they make you pay extra for game that were free just 2 months ago.Dumb to have to switch between 2 apps to watch different games. Poorly thought out,Yes
Not what I thought it would be wanted nbc sports net . So this rating really should not count,Yes
Downloaded it to watch the Olympics and was very excited. THEN it tells me to activate with my TV provider. YOU are my TV provider. Why would I watch it on the fire stick and not on regular tv?????? Very poorly thought out.,Yes
Horrible user interface.  Who thought scrolling through 300 videos with no filter or sorting was a good idea?!,Yes
I thought it had tactical camera selection in watching games so I√¢??ll be canceling the following month,Yes
I was using this app on my phone and computer and could watch everything in the app. So I thought this one would work the same. Even after going through the code entry to sync with my U-Verse account I can't watch anything but short highlights. Very deceiving and a bummer.,Yes
Very hard to get around and navigate- missed a lot of action trying to use features,Yes
Replays & clips were great. Sufficient cameras were placed to catch all the action,Yes
"I thought I could watch ANY Olympic event, but every event I chose said No Authorization. I do not understand. It said live streaming. I am extremely upset this app will not as promised.",Yes
didn't give me what I thought it would.,Yes
Didn't use this as much as I thought I would.  But worked fine,Yes
Wasn't what I thought I was paying for. Not able to watch live TV sports.,Yes
Thought I could watch the Olympics without cable using the app but NBC requires a cable subscription. If I had a cable subscription I would just watch it through my cable provider instead of downloading this app.,Yes
"Love it and wished I'd heard about it earlier. There is more to watch than I even thought about with the free apps. My grandson loves the free game apps and kid stuff, and I'm no longer paying $150 a month for paid programming and 20 year old movies I've already seen 5 times. I attached a flat antenna to my tv and now I can also get local channels. Perfect!",Yes
Not what I thought it was or what I want,Yes
Not what I thought it was!,Yes
"I thought I could watch golf Channel on this, but only selected golf events",Yes
I thought LIVE meant LIVE.  So far all I have seen is prerecorded sports.,Yes
"Constant buffering with the app. Was pretty good at a distance, but couldn't keep up with the quick play action.",Yes
Out of control.poor quality,Yes
"had  trouble getting the sound to go though  the sound bar (could not get sound thought the sound bar)could not get picture on the tv to be fulll screen on the 65"" tv",Yes
This didn't do what I thought it would and I uninstalled it about 3 hours after I purchased it.  Merp!,Yes
I am unhappy with this as I was charged today. I thought there was no charge and it was on 0.00 at the time.,Yes
"My daughter downloaded this.. I have had zero interactions with it, other than writing this review, which I felt compelled to write.",Yes
This product is not what I expected. I thought it would work like cast but it does not,Yes
No what i thought it was!,Yes
"I thought I was downloading a free app, but after it searched and found garbage, it didn't do anything except direct me buy the cleaner to clean it up. So it was totally misleading in the first place by having ""Trash Cleaner"" in its name.I tried to buy the cleaner anyway ( about $3.49), but wasn't able to do so.So I uninstalled the whole thing from my device and cloud, and got something else.",Yes
"Occasionally I have had an uncomfortable feeling regarding the safety of a website, especially when I try to backout, and my command is ignored. I immediately close my kindle, reopen, go directly to this cleaning app to clean out the garbage. This app came recommended for my Kindle, it has never disappointed me.",Yes
"This app finds junk left behind by two other popular cleaning apps. My Kindle seems faster already. Thanks for the fresh start.I didn't realize home much unnecessary trash I had stored. I thought the other cleaning apps where cleaning p,protecting and maintaining my Kindle as promised. That was definitely not the case",Yes
"Scam. I thought this was another app (which I had used before) so I didn't bother looking at reviews. What a mistake. This is a bait & switch advertisement. It does nothing of benefit (for the device user, anyway).",Yes
"Ran it and found 3.3GB of garbage, had to buy it to remove, I bought it then had it clean and remove, it rrenoves 0.03GB of garbage. Asmall, fraction of what it claimed it could clean.",Yes
This app reduces wasted time organizing and setting up the cleaning process. It's easy and uncomplicated to run. This is the best app for cleaning and securing the safety of your tablet.,Yes
This was thorough and fast. I'd tried other programs that didn't clean as much or as quickly. I use it at least once a month to keep the clutter under control.,Yes
"This app cleans trash from my kindleHowever I don't really perceive any change in downloading.  The Wi-Fi connection is a greater influence, I believe.",Yes
It's a great app. Runs faster than most others.  Got my Kindle to brand new like speeds.  It is a great adjunct to my othersecurity apps I have running.,Yes
My Kindle Fire was so slow. I reset it to factory status and it was still slower than it should be. I then downloaded this app and used it. It helped so much!,Yes
"It scans your device and after scanning shows ,? Would you like to down load cleaner,I thought I just did ,then it tells you ,you have to pay for itNot free",Yes
"When I downloaded this free app, I thought it would do what it is called. Apparently it just locates files and malware that needs removed. Then you have to add a second app to remove said files. That app you have to buy. Thanks for nothing.",Yes
Not sure what it d o esp as I ran it 3 times and got the same amt of MB removed. If it work it's quick and easy for tech challenged.,Yes
One of my kindle was running slow and programs were stopping all the time so I bought another one because I thought it was getting old. I have had it for a couple of years. When I got the next one I was just checking into different apps and saw this one to clean up my kindle. I bought it and it works great on both my kindle! The older one works like it's new! Thanks!,Yes
"14 Viruses and 600 Megabytes of trash found the first time I ran the app a few days ago.  Just previous to starting this review the app reported 7 viruses and over 700 Megabytes of trash files.  I've noticed an improvement in load times for the sites I visit while surfing the net.  Predominantly this consists of my Yahoo and Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest  & Tumbler accounts (this is the first time I've listed all my social interaction accounts together; how did I get so many?) and company websites that are reported in the technology and science newsletters I subscribe to.  I'm frankly surprised by the number of viruses that are showing up, as I do not regard any of these sites as high risk--such as the many porn sites on the net.I'm less concerned with what is being removed from my Kindle than others who've posted reviews than I am in making sure my Kindle is secure from damaging malware, but I agree that it would be helpful to have a more detailed report of what the app has found and proposes to delete, before said deletion.  However, I have not yet found anything that I wanted to keep missing, so I'm quite happy with the app.",Yes
Advertised as a free app .. then after initial scan they wanted to sell me the product even though it found no threats.If it can't find threats .. why buy it ?security tool for Fire (Securza) found problems and corrected them for free when this optimizer missed them .,Yes
My tablet got agonizingly slow.I thought it as my internet connection.Iran the optimized and saw a significant improvement,Yes
"Uploaded in a snap.  Scans run quickly.  I cannot really tell whether this cleans EVERY virus , but it adds a level of security that I'm at least doing something right by cleaning garbage and viruses.",Yes
Really speeds up reaction time of my fire.,Yes
Super easy transaction. Would highly recommend! Great game!,Yes
I was astonished at the strength of the cleaning system and pleased with the rapid scan!  It brings  sense of totalsecurity!,Yes
clutter kills speed and stability...this app helps clear the clutter,Yes
"Does exactly what they say ,but it only  tells you what it found, period. To get it to get rid of it found you must in app, buy the rest of the app to make it work. That is pretty  much false advertising as far as I am concerned. It is a very effective app once you get it all, and does a good job. It said it found 7virus files and i have three security programs that I run daily that never found any virus risks. That is the only reason I bought it.",Yes
"I'm running this on an older Fire HD 8.9. Seems effective, maybe? There is no obvious report or logs of viruses or trash files. After allowing the app to run its scan,you have to just blindly trust the app/developers and allow the actions to run without opportunity for review.",Yes
"Downloaded the app and it found 2 viruses in 2 or 3 seconds.  I thought WOW.  This must be great for free.  Then it asked me to purchase.  Amazon please review before offering to clients.  Oops, we have a problem.",Yes
"My kindle which is a few years old started slowing down and even giving me the dreaded ""blue screen"" when browsing the internet . I thought I'd have to retire it but after using this app, no more blue screens and is running much faster. Very happy so far",Yes
"I never thought that I had viruses on my kindle, nice to have a means to check",Yes
Easy to use and provides clear easy to understand descriptions of what actions were taken.,Yes
Does more than I expected.Much quicker than I thought it would be,Yes
"Bought √¢??Tablet Optimizer & Cleaner√¢?¬ù recently for myAmazon Kindle Fire HDX 8.9"" Received pm 8/11/14In Kindle HDX 8.9  I thought the battery was dead 11/5/15Initially it claimed I had 9 virus√¢?? and 880 junk files,  Today my machine locked up again while I was reading and would not let me reopen a book.So I ran the program√¢?¬¶.  Previously I had backed up my fire and returned it to Factory settings.  Have now done this twice√¢?¬¶.and each time the machine recovered after an hour or so and I was able to read√¢?¬¶Again ran the Tablet Optimizer & Cleaner  did a power off√¢?¬¶. For √Ç¬Ω hour and same problemDon√¢??t know what Tablet Optimizer & Cleaner  actually did but can√¢??t say it helpedNow claims all √¢??bad files removed√¢?¬ù  but my books won√¢??t reopen.  Junk?",Yes
This has given me a real sense ofsecurity for protecting my Kindle Fire.,Yes
Immediate goes to higher status purchase. Plus did nothing after initiated scan. Useless and waste of space!,Yes
"Does the job, but only after you pay a one time fee.  Fee is reasonable but its like the TV commercial where thesecurity guard is only a crime monitor.  I didn't need a free app to tell me I've trash and viruses...what's the point?",Yes
I thought this was a free apt.,Yes
This works.  Very pleased with actions and it actually does as described.,Yes
Finally a cleaner that will work and not stall.  I have confidence that this part 2 of mysecurity is worth it!,Yes
"It works and for a technically challenged person, that's all I need!",Yes
"I bought the app,  I thought the free version wasn't as good. It does the job and speeds my tablet up when it slows. Do I think it's the best? No but I am a not a computer wiz so it works for me for now.",Yes
"I downloaded this and purchased the app cleaner. Was a little pricey but well worth the one time cost. As soon as I hit the ""clean garbage"" button it had my kindle fire back to ""like new"" status. Was lagging and getting stuck on pages in browser. After clean up it only took seconds to get back to normal.",Yes
This is an easy quick way to check on the status of my tablet daily.  I really enjoy using it.,Yes
Great for someone like me who is technically challenged!,Yes
"There really wasnt anything I disliked.I thought everything was good,worked well.",Yes
"Thought this would sork, but it forces you to purchase the product!",Yes
"Every computer, even a Kindle needs protection.",Yes
"Fast scan and cleaner, glad I bought because it found a couple viruses my previous app did not.  Only 4 because it could use a few more user directions and navigation plus communication on status and last scanned.",Yes
"How does a Factory Default Reset Kindle Fire 8"" HD tablet have viruses?  I don't know how either!  All I know is I have been working with Kindle support for 2 months trying to fix it.  We had tried everything.  Finally, we thought we had found then problem.  It was the SD Card.  They had me remove it and they replaced it for free.  My tablet worked fine after that and I couldn't be happier.  It worked for a total of 11 hours and then the problem returned.  THANK GOD I WAS TOLD ABOUT THIS APP TODAY!!!  I decided to try something so I did a Factory Default Reset, downloaded this app, and ran it.  It took no time at all and this app found 3 viruses and fixed them.",Yes
This is a pretty reasonable price for protection of my Kindle. It works fast.,Yes
Thought I got scammed at first but this app cleaned my fire and sped it up,Yes
"Worthless, it searches out, but does not get rid of viruses. All this app does is bait someone into buying virus protection.",Yes
"It does what it says, as easily as it says, I'm pleased and as I am somewhat technology challenged easy but effective is good.",Yes
I thought that was what I did when I installed this app. You have failed this user goodbye.,Yes
"I bought the app after reading some of the reviews and thought it would at least be decent, but it's just a downloaded endless loop of disappointment. The app started up right away, everything was clean quick and right to the point, so of course at first I loved it. Then I went and did the scan on my tablet, and again it was wicked fast and claimed to have found 6 viruses & a few junk files. I think awesome! then I see the button that says ""Download Cleaner"". So now I'm a little frustrated that I have to go and download ANOTHER app when the name clearly says Optimizer AND &&& Cleaner.So I brush it off and go ahead to download the cleaner except there's no free version of the cleaner. You can look at other people's great reviews about the app but you can't share their joy w/out paying $4 and some change. Whats gonna happen after that? Have to pay another five bucks for every useful tool this app claims to offer?Completely disappointed, this app has been a complete waste of time.",Yes
"When I tried the app, I thought it was going to show a bunch of ads and not work, instead it cleans my Fire and works mostly better.",Yes
I've used for awhile and it always seems to speed up reaction time.,Yes
"Requires microtransaction to actually clean the system (not just scan), but once purchased it is super-convenient.",Yes
"I gave it a 3-star rating for one reason. If I am wrong (and these days that's entirely possible), please look at this as a higher rating. When I first ran a ""scan"" of my device (Kindle Fire), I saw the scan completed literally within seconds which I thought was good. Supposedly there were 2 potential things to worry about. To try and fix those two things however, it appeared as though there was a fee to be paid (can't remember what I thought it said). In effect, the only part of the APP that was free was the scan and not the resolution/removal of any potential problems with the device. If I am wrong......as I said....please look at this as an inaccurate rating and form your own opinion.",Yes
Works better than I thought it would...Great product. I use it almost daily,Yes
This is a greatsecurity cleaning app for your kindle,Yes
Use on Kindle fire. Would like to see more complete notes on actions.,Yes
Thought this app would be a little more detailed,Yes
"After using a popular cleaner, booster, virus scanning program for several years it occured to me that on three different tablets - and a zillion scans -not one virus had ever been detected. Upon noticing this application was designed for Kindle Fire tablets I thought I'd give it a go. On the first scan two viruses were found, cleaned, and eliminated. Today fourteen more were discovered! The process is lightning fast - no long wait. My Kindle Fire is working great.  Plus, I like the fact that this application is providing a higher level of protection for my tablet. There's a huge investment of money, time, and irreplaceable information on my tablet. It's foolish not to protect it.",Yes
"Can't see much difference in my Fire's performance, speed of uploading or anti-virus protection.",Yes
"This app is a scam. Downloaded and ran it.  It reported there were 3 viruses but if you select the Clean button you are taken to a screen to BUY the ability to clean. I thought maybe it did not install right. So I uninstalled and reinstalled it. Ran the scan and now get a report that says I have 8 viruses. Clean still takes to page to buy cleaner capability.  So, at this point it looks like even the Scan function is a scam, reporting random different results from 2 different installs in less that 5 minutes.  I am surprised Amazon allows this deceptive practice. It appears Amazon does not vet the apps. Very disappointing.",Yes
"After buying this app, which I'm thinking is a scam....why do I have to leave a review to get updates? I paid for it, I should get updates no matter what! And after all I'm reading, I can't help but feeling more to the point of this being a scam. I'll be calling Amazon for a refund and suggest they may want to test their products that they recommend....just a thought?!?!The initial use was surprisingly fast, said I had 8 viruses..I'm thinking malware may be just the same and that's free!!!",Yes
"I thought it was free, but in the end it cost me $4.29. I could download part of it for free, but in order to make it work, it needed another part for $4.29",Yes
Price is very reasonable for the protection it provides. I have a Kindle Fire. First scan revealed 9 viruses. Def recommend!,Yes
this wasn't what I thought it was and am glad it was free.,Yes
Thought I would try it.downloaded it and of course it said I had 5 viruses and if I wanted to get rid of them I had to pay to download there virus removal system . It a big scam to get you to buy there stuff when they tell you to down load there app for free .Don't do it!,Yes
Really helped my kindle fire to run better. Thought that it was free. Realized that the scan is free but to clean the fire you have to pay for the app.,Yes
"I was very disappointed with this app. I thought it would be great to be able to scan and optimize my fire using a free app. However, all it does is scan, and then say you can fix any problems if you purchase the full app for $3.73. Just give me the real deal and charge me up front instead of wasting my time.",Yes
Seems to work fine it's worth having a little extra protection.Even got it on sale!,Yes
I've been lookin for a GOOD cleanup app n thought this was it but I was WRONG,Yes
Really nice protection and very easy to use.,Yes
I thought my Fire was a done deal till I used this app. My Fire is back on Fire !!!,Yes
"This is an app I've used since it first appeared as a recommendation for Amazon Kindle √∞??¬• users. I have never had to pay for it like so many of you  apparently did. Therefore, maybe it doesn't really do anything; I haven't the understanding of technology to be sure. I don't think it would ever clean nearly as much as CCleaner. But unless I've somehow completely stripped clean (something I understand to be detrimental to the health and long-life of all my devices) my Kindle it seems to pick a few odds and ends. Perhaps it addresses Kindle issues the all-around CCleaner misses. My girlfriend used it first and introduced it to me.5 stars √¢¬≠¬ê√¢¬≠¬ê√¢¬≠¬ê√¢¬≠¬ê√¢¬≠¬ê because it does what I keep installing it to accomplish.  Don't raise expectations.*The most recent uninstall was because it seemed to get ""hooked-up"" within the workings of another app.  I am hoping the most recent update fixed this frustrating complication.  S2",Yes
"great! easy, effective, but still leaves the user in control",Yes
"Wouldn't clean anything without buying full package. Said I have 13 viruses, but anothersecurity app detects none",Yes
Addedsecurity,Yes
I wanted some protection for my kind!e fire withokut having to pay a big fee. This is perfect and suits my needs.,Yes
"App is not working the way it was advertised.. Run scan, then clean, then scan again  same numbers of trash appears  wish I had my money back, I also don't understand why it says free, then to use it, you pay $4.99. I am not a novice user, but I thought free download meant free usage also.",Yes
"Scans fast. Thought it was free, but only the scan was.",Yes
Works great.  Got asecurity app?,Yes
So far so good.  Simple.......has virus protection which is nice.,Yes
Great app.  Very smooth with foscams.  Controls mic and speakers very well. Love the Chromecast function.,Yes
I use this with my homesecurity system. It works great. Together with IP Camera app I just turned by old phone into a baby monitor.,Yes
allows you to see what you need and control your cameras wherever you are (with access to the internet of course).,Yes
"OK, I downloaded the free version of this a couple of months ago and it was ok if you want to see strange places, but that got boring real quick. As I was getting ready to completely remove it from my fire I decided to check it out one more time. When I did I decided to check out the upgrade and read up on what this was capable of, and I gambled the $3.49 and purchased it... I AM BLOWN AWAY! I can actually see my home on my fire from anywhere. I downloaded webcamXP 5 to my laptop(free) and I can see what my laptop's camera is seeing anytime from anywhere I can get online. I got an inhomesecurity system for less than 4 bucks! (I watched my dog meander through the house, always wondered what he did all day, lol). The webcamXP 5 program can actually be scheduled to turn on the camera whenever you want it. I LOVE this tinyCam Monitor PRO and I highly reccommend it. It works perfectly with my Kindle fire.",Yes
Works great with all my foscam cameras. Has some extra controls that sets it above some of the other apps out there. Keep up the good work.,Yes
"It won't work with android wear watches. Which is why I purchased it. The description says it works with android wear watches. However, I get a pop-up that there is a bug with Amazon DRM protection. I don't like to give this a low reading, since it isn't the developers fault (if purchased from Google Play Store, it evidently works without a hitch). However, it still does not work as advertised.",Yes
using this with Panasonic op cam.  the sound coming from the cam can be harsh and distorted at times.  wish this had a volume/gain control. using this on my kindle.fire.,Yes
allows for multiple camera views at once controls are usable but does not scan Lan accurately does not detect my camera,Yes
"I am very satisfied with tinyCam Monitor Pro.  I had tried four different ""free"" IP cam apps and decided to go with tinyCam due to it's ease of use and extra features such as support for 2-way audio and smooth PTZ controls.I am using this with Foscam FI9821P, FI9821W, and FI8910W IP cameras and this app does a great job for only a few dollars.",Yes
Great app. Easy to set up. Perfect app to view homesecurity cameras.,Yes
"Of all of thesecurity camera apps I have, this one seems to work for all of them. It does not always support every function of the camera s. But at least it supports them.",Yes
This is the best app I've ever installed on my phone. It connects to multiple brand cameras. You can see multiple cameras on a screen or individually. You can also control the camera with a touch control. It connects to my Panasonic camera allowing microphone and speaker functionality. It also allows zooming in. Even the original PC software cannot do that well.  Well worth it!,Yes
"This app allows you to monitor your videosecurity system at home.  Please be aware that if you are not on a WIFI you are using your mobile device√¢??s data plan and you may be using a lot of data transferring videos and photos.  You can actually make your Android device a mobile DVR.  Remember.  Don√¢??t forget your data plan limits.I own and use multiplesecurity camera and DVR systems within my home that monitor and record the video on internal hard disk drives.  All of them are accessible via the internet and WIFI as they all come with their own Apps that allow interfacing to my Android and Apple devices.  This software is thus redundant for me to use.When I first scanned my network for cameras the system found none.  It is because it was on the wrong WIFI network and I had to change the WIFI settings for my Samsung tablet to the same network that thesecurity system is on.  If you can√¢??t find your camera you have to go to your smart device settings and change the network access.  If you have not used that WIFI on your device you will have to know the SSID and the password for that WIFI system to sign on.Once I scanned the right network the system found my servers,security cameras and my ubiquity Network system.  I logged into the Foscam system and the app then asked me what the camera password was.  Remember you can lock yoursecurity DVRs and even individual cameras for privacy and you will have to know that data to sign on.  Upon entering the correct data the camera location popped up and displayed the camera√¢??s live video.By tapping on the live video I was able to see the camera video full screen and touch the record icon and record the video.  You are also able to use the camera motion detection systems to minimize the amount of transferred data and only collect data when movement is present and being monitored.The benefit of this app is that you may be able to combine multiple camera networks into one app for monitoring and checking.  Just be aware that if you are not on the same WIFI network the ability to see the video may be blocked by your cable modem.  That is a long discussion and it is not possible to cover here. You can possibly even add in local camera if you have their IP address like a local school or weather network.  As part of a demo you can see random action cameras working around the world that are public for example.This is a nice app but again I warn you to be aware of your mobile data plan limits.  If you are not on a WIFI you could be using up your expensive data plan and get a big mobile bill from your supplier.  It will take some skill to connect and use this app and you should be aware of that requirement.  The app does work and deliver what it promises.Permissions:√¢?¬¢ Record audio√¢?¬¢ Modify or delete the contents of your USB storage√¢?¬¢ Full network access√¢?¬¢ View network connections√¢?¬¢ Draw over other apps√¢?¬¢ Control vibration√¢?¬¢ Prevent tablet from sleeping√¢?¬¢ Install shortcutsThis app contains adware using Google Mobile Ads (AdMob).  Google Analytics is integrated into the AdMob interface, giving the developer powerful and deep insights into their customer database.  It also contains and uses Dropbox while it states the app does not use 3rd parties to send file and data?  Dropbox is used to transfer larger files between locations using the internet and Dropbox services.  The app also uses HockyApp which is an Analytics program aimed at beta testing that can monitor the user and determine language used, device type and other data.  HockeyApp is owned by Microsoft.The app installed 16.59MB into my device memory.  I moved it to my SD card and it left 5.75MB in my device memory and it transferred 14.25MB onto my SD card.",Yes
"This app is top-notch if you have IP cameras you'd like to control remotely. I know most IP cameras offer some sort of proprietary app with limited features -- ""light versions"", and then also their own with advanced features -- ""pro versions"". I own 2 IP cameras, different models, but same company and still find that tinyCam Monitor PRO meets my needs.The camera discovery option is great. I like being able to press a button to have it discover all of the cameras on my network. The only problem I have with this is that it will use the local IP address to add it. If you plan to use the app away from home (outside of wifi range), you'll need to adjust the (advanced) IP settings accordingly. Also depending on your home setup, you may have to forward a couple ports etc.The PTZ (pan tilt zoom) is great -- you can use a single-button option, where you press and it moves a little, or you can use what I'll call a ""continuous"" version where you swipe and control the movement more fluidly.I really like having almost ALL of the same options the manufacturer's own software provides. Kudos to the developers on a great product!I received this product for free around June-ish -- I can't remember if it was an Amazon promotion or one from the developer. I only was able to review it now since I only now have compatible IP cameras. With that said, trying to add a camera that isn't network-discoverable (through the built-in search option) offers plenty of manufacturers. If you go to the developers website they have an easier to follow list of compatible machines.",Yes
I have asecurity system with three different brands of ip cameras.  TinyCam auto-discovered them all and I had it working in under five minutes.  The interface is clean and user-friendly .  I recommend this product.,Yes
"This app works, so it at least deserves 3 stars. However I've been unable to figure out how to use the Pan/Tilt controls at all using the Remote for the Amazon Fire Stick (there are only so many buttons on the remote and none of them seem to be related to the ptz controls). Yes I can view the camera, but an important part (for me at least) in it being useful is the ability to pan/tilt. If someone see's this and would be able to explain how to make the camera move with the Fire Stick Remote, or I manage to figure it out myself, I'd be very grateful and would be happy to update this review.",Yes
"I use it for the different cameras in my home but mostly with the baby cam because it's native app SUCKS BALLS (D-Link!). I wish I could have a little more control of the camera options with this app but it is understandable for a third party app. I don't know if it's user error or an issue with the app but I seem to not be able to get sound from the baby cam, either.",Yes
Truly is the 'Swiss Knife' to IP cameras.  I'm using mine with the Wyze cams.  Perfect for serving my cams to ActionTiles.,Yes
"This app works like a charm. I walked through the setup and added my wyze cam info for each cam and now I can see all 4 at once, Cycle through each manually or automatically. I can even control the Wyze pan & zoom camera from the firetv remote. The best part is it is a local app running through the router in my home so there is no lag even when watching all 4 at once. This app made my Wyze cam setup even more functional as a homesecurity system. I can not recommend this app enough.",Yes
Freezes on Fire TV. Pretty much useless. Will update thoughts if they fix the app.,Yes
I never actually got to use the app so I really can't comment on it's performance.All I know is after I downloaded the app it drove mysecurity apps crazy I was unable to perform any action without receiving a pop up about the app.I am a decent tech savy individual but I couldn't get the app set to hault mysecurity apps from trying to remove it so I finally just removed the app.,Yes
Does just what I needed.. I have been working with it for a week. Have all my office cameras displaying and even all controls. Great application.,Yes
"Terrific camera app.  I put in my settings for my two IP cams and presto!  The remote controls work perfectly.  I can move the camera, toggle sound, even speak through the camera's built in speakers from my smartphone (okay, that last feature is a bit spooky).  No tedious setup.",Yes
"I love this software. I use Blue Iris on a PC to manage four different brands ofsecurity cameras, to watch over our other house. TinyCam has a built in web server, and motion and sound detection, and it could be used as your NVR/alarm.We have a site-to-site VPN set up with the location we monitor, and distribute the connection to the B.I. server and various TVs and phones in the house that run TinyCam. When away from home, VPN client software on phones does the trick, giving us convenient and very secure access to our cameras.TinyCam is just plain awesome.",Yes
"I run quite a few IP cameras including integration withsecurity spy with no issues. The app is feature rich, but even better than that,  tech support was top notch.Don't hesitate to invest in this nifty app pro version is the only way to go!",Yes
"Seems to be a pretty good camera app with a lot of useful function and a well-thought-out user interface. It's at least as good as IP Cam Viewer Pro, the other app I've used for a while to monitor my home cameras when I'm away. The only problem I have with it is that the app-to-camera voice function doesn't seem to work with my Foscam 18918W camera.",Yes
This is my favorite camera monitor software.  The feature set is quite comprehensive.  I have it configured to pull live feeds from D-Link and Foscam cameras.  It can remotely control my Foscam (PTZ) and the recording of live video to my smartphone is a handy feature!,Yes
Purchased to use with a Foscam unit.  I could find the camera but never could get it to connect.  I suspect it would have eventually worked with enough tinkering but I thought the help and support resources were lacking.,Yes
Best app Ever! I use this app all the time to watch my car and my patio door. It records images and sends them to my email. View live and it's only a spit sec. difference in time. Control your camera right from the app. We plan to add more cameras.,Yes
"The best application to manage IP Cams... I have a copuple ofsecurity cams, a couple of baby cams... so easy to setup, and manage. Use it on my Android devices as well as fire TV. Great APP!",Yes
"I started with the Free version of this App and quickly upgraded to the Pro version.  It has all the features that I need to control my Foscam FI8910W from anywhere with a WiFi connection.1. Pan/Tilt2. Horizontal/Vertical Patrol (basically back-and-forth monitoring)3. Alert/Alarm settings that email you when motion or send is detected4. Resolution changes5. Reboot6. Sound on/off7. Mic on/off8. Preset camera positions9. InfraRed on/off/auto10. Brightness/contrast11. Zoom in/out (although my camera doesn't support that feature)12. Video RecordingAll-in-all, it is a great app, very simple to use, and all the features that you need.  I highly recommend this app!",Yes
This app works awesome as a baby andsecurity monitor! I have no complaints at all. Keep up the great work.,Yes
"Wow this app really can control the majority of my Foscam HD PTZsecurity camera controls. The user interface is pretty smart as well, clean when you want it to be and full of options when you need them. If you set up your cameras properly you should be up and running within no time, controlling PTZ and everything! Works with RaspberryPi video streaming (Motion) and foscam fi9821w v2",Yes
"VERY difficult to use/setup. Never have gotten it to work with the Swannsecurity cameras we have. Waste of money for the app and time trying to make it work. But if you want to look at random cameras around the world that have no description, this is for you! Because that is all that works.",Yes
"Works great with my 3 Foscam Wifi P/T cameras!I tried the free version to verify that it could connect and operate my cameras, and it worked great, so I upgraded to the paid version (easy setup with the convenient export/import feature - very well thought out). The PRO features are totally worth the price.FastThis app works easily and the control/response from the camera is much faster than the app I was using on my iPhone. There is a lot of extra functionality like motion/audio detection and auto-recording and uploading. My kids like to turn the motion alarm on, and see if they can ""Ninja"" past the kitchen cam undetected (worth $3 right there just for the sustained silence/giggles from them!).Works on Fire StickI hadn't even thought of trying this on the Fire TV Stick until I read a few reviews here. I was really happy to see that it worked pretty well (the navigation is a little challenging, but you get used to it), and I was glad that one purchase gets me an app on 2 devices! Knowing that this works nicely on the Fire Stick opens up a bunch of possibilities for monitoring.Works great on Kindle Fire HDI can view all 3 cams at once, see/hear the motion alarm go off when there is movement, easily record, and do all the things you could imagine you would want to do in asecurity cam app.The Kindle Fire I have doesn't have a mic, but I read that headphones w/mic might work, and was very happy to find that my iPhone headphones work w/the Kindle, and I can talk/listen over the cameras with 'reasonable' clarity! I had pretty much given up on being able to talk over the cams, as all the apps I had tried in the past would send such garbled sound, (worse than Charlie Brown's teachers...kids look it up) and I couldn't get any mobile/desktop app to work with the Foscam 9821W talk functionality. This is the first app that lets me talk to that cam, and it works great!securityIt is great that SSL and encrypted password features are available, and work well, allowing you to access/control your cameras externally, but securely.The software is well designed and seems to be updated pretty frequently, as you can see from the support site: http://tinycammonitor.com/changelog.htmlNit-picks:- I wish the default view would have the movement controls- The 'preset' functions don't work for me",Yes
Great app with a lot of options and control. Background audio feature is key for baby monitor. Paired with Foscam Fl9821W V2.,Yes
I'm not very technical but was able to set up this in minutes.  Very easy setup and great layout for easy control.  Me and my wife use this app to monitor our younger kids after school.  It is very useful and has all the bells and whistles.  Would definitely recomend this app to anybody looking for a full featured easy to use ipcamera app.  Also in my opinion it is very worth it to upgrade to the pro version.,Yes
Only app that i trust to managed my homesecurity camera.  No need to send to Chinese Communist cloud servers,Yes
Good app overall. Well worth the money. Icons a little cryptic for beginners but has a lot of features and controls.,Yes
use this app on all devices for mysecurity cameras.,Yes
"This is the #1 app that I have found for viewing my Foscam and DLink IP cameras on my Android phone.Just works so incredibly well, easy to interface with all the cameras, great layout, full control including microphone and PTZ.Supports encryption and SSL.  The new feature for DVR is also pretty neat, can take and old device and turn it into a ultra low power ultra convert DVR device.If your looking for an app to get, this is the one.  And hey it has a free version as well so you can try before you buy.",Yes
"Excellent viewer for my home cams!!  Super easy to setup even without the need of any manual or online help.  Great control on accessing the cam and swivel it around, with great easy buttons on taking instant photos and video.  Highly recommend it to all users.",Yes
"I got this app to use with my Fire TVs and at first it worked great.  However, I have since wasted many hours setting this up with the 16 D-linksecurity cameras I have, only to see the app suddenly quit working and have to go through the whole process again.  I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app, fiddled with all the complicated settings, and am just tired of dealing with it now.  II am pretty tech savy but the aggravation just isn't worth it and I do NOT recommend this",Yes
"Does a great job showing and controlling cameras.  Contacted support to have h264 support for my 933L.  They wanted to access the camera.  I set up a guest account, then they disappeared.  They have it for other models in the same line and their compatibility document says it is supported.  Without it, streaming is very slow.  So double check your compatible cameras.  Would give more stars but...",Yes
"I have 5security cameras in a closed network being displayed. There is no internet access. The software is powerful, but easy to setup at the same time. The problem that I'm having is that it will only work for about 15 to 20 minutes, then the software blows up. If I provide internet access, it works perfect. The developer has not responded to my email.  I'm still looking to a solution.",Yes
"Don't buy this app.I wasted $4. App crashes on Fire TV stick, shuts itself off going back to home screen of Fire TV. I bought it to be able to watch kids sleep while working on a computer in the other room. It ended up being a big pain in the ass distraction, as every time I looked at the tv screen, app was gone, and I needed to pick up remote and restart it. Sometimes it worked for 5 minutes, other time only 1 minute.",Yes
"Easy to add cameras, has a professional look and feel..BUT...none of the camera control features work. None, no pan/tilt, presets, na da...",Yes
"Don't see too many reviews of this app for the 1st gen Fire TV stick and specific camera models so adding my experience here. Bought the app since I had good experience with it before on a 2012 Nexus 7 with Foscam 8910W (480P) cameras.Fast forward a few years and i've since added Foscam 9821 (720P) and Amcrest IP2M-841 (1080P) cameras as well and thought over the weekend that it would be nice to be able to see the cams on a large TV via the Fire TV stick.Checked the amazon app store and saw that the app is listed as compatible so without hesitation I bought it given the good experience before. First the good, the scan feature is very good and picked up IP addresses, custom ports, camera make, model correctly for the most part so all I had to do was confirm cameras and enter user name and password. There was a bit of a learning curve to using the fire tv remote to navigate but do able.Now the bad, the 480p cameras worked fine as expected getting about 14-15 fps which is in line with MJPEG camera frame rates; video is reasonably smooth. The 720p cameras were disappointing at 9-10 fps, we're in choppy video territory here now. The 1080p camera was inexcusably bad at ~4 fps, we're talking someone walking across the room looks like they are teleporting 3ft forward at a time. This is all using the built in app's hardware acceleration setting.I reached out to support and he advised that the Fire TV is slow hardware and essentially to lower my resolution on the camera or get better hardware like an Nvidia shield. The Fire TV stick while slow overall can play 1080P videos from Amazon, Netflix, Plex, etc so I think I was somewhat reasonable in my expectation that H264 cameras would work fine with the hardware provided but I guess I was wrong.I will try limiting the app to one camera next to see if that improves the performance.Edit Mar 2017:Removed all the 480P cameras and now only have 2 cameras connected to the app: one 720P Foscam and one 1080P Amcrest, FPS has now improved when in full screen mode: 720P camera fluctuates between 6-10 FPS but seems to stabilize out around 10 FPS, still choppy video overall but usuable as a baby cam and not for any kind of detailed viewing/recording, 1080P camera seems to stabilize around 14-16 FPS and under low motion appears reasonably smooth but again not what you'd want for detailed viewing/recording.When both cameras are on screen in the multicam view, both slow down to about 7 FPS and basically unusable past the point of a series of slow moving pictures but if all you need is any kind of visual like a camera in the garage to verify if the door is open or closed....it'll do.I have the app running on 2 1st gen Fire TV sticks bought at the same time; one seems to like the HW decoding better and the other does better in HW mode. Same app, same generation hardware, same cameras, perhaps there are hardware differences inside?The moment I try adding the 480P cameras back in the mix, performance suffers again. I also tried using with just the 1080P cam and it only picked up another 1-2 FPS.Installed the app on a Gen I Fire tablet as well and using with only the 1080P camera in HW mode, am getting 30 FPS in daylight but expect that IR performance at night will likely suffer as well.Conclusion: use with 2 H264 cameras at most on a Gen I Fire TV stick and Gen I Fire tablet. If you have the hardware already like I did, it's ok value to get a little bit of extra utility out of them.",Yes
Wasn√¢??t able to use on my action tiles. Waste of money,Yes
The best Cam Monitoring App available.  I have tried them all.  Works with all my cameras (D-Link).  Loaded with options and full camera control.,Yes
"Even better than IP Cam Viewer Pro, and I thought I'd never switch from that. Still room for improvement, but it's pretty darn perfect as-is.",Yes
"I bought this to use as a baby monitor on my kindle fire HD with my foscam 8910W cameras. The app has a camera scanner so it can get most of the details for set up on its own. Once I figured out the difficult part of port forwarding using a YouTube video or two, I'm now able to view my cameras from anywhere and I bought the app for my Android phone.Best features: control camera movement, movement and sound alarms, and viewing more than one camera at a time.",Yes
no pan and tilt control for my foscams wireless and Panasonic bl230a cams.  no way to turn on/off IR on the foscam.  my brother recommended this because it has all these features on his android phone and he is using the free version.  I paid $3.49 and got less of an app for my Zoom.,Yes
Bestsecurity camera app ever,Yes
"Used for my multiple branded IP camera and work great with it. one fee, no micro transaction.",Yes
The DEFINITIVE app for video surveillanceit has ALL the features you expect and gives you full control to customize each camera/channelI have tried many apps in Android but tinyCam Monitor Pro is the clear Winner!Keep it up Tiny Solutions and Pleasedon't forget to release a Proper PC Version as a companion for this android app,Yes
Great multi video wyze cam add on .faster up time multi view for security cameras.please check first for compatibility before committing to a purchase,Yes
"Great, cheap solution for turning wireless IP cameras into baby monitors. The app is perfectly reliable and pretty intuitive to use.Two complaints for the developers.1) The manual panning controls are bad enough to be useless (I have two Foscam cameras). The controls basically only go all the way up, down, left, or right and offer no fine tuning. Fortunately, I rarely ever need the panning controls, but it would be nice if they worked when needed.2) Recording of videos does not record the audio with the video making the video recording feature pretty meh.",Yes
I thought it One has to have an account in order to view it.as free to use,Yes
"I have this app for my android phone and I LOVE IT, but on the Fire TV Stick....it totally sucks. The Fire TV Stick is basically just Android, so the app that is on the FireTV is the exact same app you would have on your phone, minus some features.I don't know if it's a limitation of the FireTV Stick or what, but the video skips like crazy, it's poor quality. On my phone it looks amazing. I'm guessing this issue a lot has to do with RAM or maybe CPU speed. Because the app on my tablet also has skippy video.The app needs better controls for using it on the TV.",Yes
"A year ago, this app was great. Worked on Android phones and Kindle Fires alike. Loved the controls, features, and performance of it. You can backup your data, share it, and even send screenshots from the camera. Really cool stuff.At some point in the last year, however, an update came out that rendered the app useless on the Kindle Fire. It opens, loads live view, then proceeds to freeze - and when I say freeze - the whole device locks up, requiring a hard reset.I've now tried this on 2 Fires - one which is rooted and running a fresh Jelly Bean ROM - so its not the Kindle OS. Something with this app does not jive with the hardware, and now I'm out $4. Very, very irritating.",Yes
Very good and easy to use multi-camera app. Support for most popularsecurity cameras. Works well with my Kindle Fire.,Yes
"Well thought out usable UI. Don't do anything fancy with it other than view my multiple Foscams, but works great for that.",Yes
Great tool to use for yoursecurity cameras! Works with Wyze cams.,Yes
I love the options available with this app and the control over the cameras.,Yes
Not worth it unless you want to view places that are no where near you nor do you even care. Thought I would be able to see places that I care to see and the video is that of the free cameras that are on buildings and located in public places. You dont need this app to see this.,Yes
Great app to bringsecurity camera stream to TV,Yes
"To whom it may concern; I downloaded this on to my Motorola zoom tablet. Before that I was able to see my cameras, I just wanted to have a little bit more control but after I downloaded this product I couldn't even see my cameras and I had no access at all. This was a big headache for me!!!!! They need to work the bugs out....oh they are... we are the beta people. Don't try their free download unless you want a free headache.",Yes
I read online that you could use this app to stream all of your Nestsecurity cameras on a single screen with FireTV. That is not the case. This app does not work with Nest cameras since the migration to Google apparently. App is non-refundable so it was just a waste of money for me.,Yes
I have been a User of tiny cam for a year now. I was very satisfied with the app and have it installed on my Droid X as well.  The issue started after the latest update to tiny cam.  The app will start to bring up mysecurity cam's and promptly lock up the fire. The kindle fire then must be hard reset by holding the power button in tell it shuts off.  I see other reviews with the same issue and it has been at enough time to pull the update and fix it. Come on people at least make the previous update available.,Yes
I thought this camera was a suvallance camera i would get in the mail i didnt know its a app i was suppose to download how do i download the tiny cam pro? It doesnt have download button next to it,Yes
"To be fair the camera app works as described and rates 4 stars based on it alone.  However, since the last Amazon app store app upgrade all apps free or paid for through the app store require you to login to amazon each time you use the app or the app won't run.  If they did this for apps advertised as free it would be wrong but no loss since you paid nothing and can get the same free apps from other sources.  But to require login for an app you bought and paid for, like this cam app, is more then wrong it boarders on scam!I don't want to here android 4.2 is the cause crap either.  Amazon's app store app, before their upgrade, did not have this. I also don't want to here they are working on it.  They should provide the older app store app and send out an update or back date notice to everyone unfortunate enough to have downloaded the latest update.  Sorry for the harsh words but this situation is nothing more then an ill thought out control mechanism and Amazon should know better.",Yes
This app does exactly what  I need it to do. My Foscam camera is fully supported with ptz control and 2 way audio. Quality and stability have been good and the motion sense plus audio controls have made great use as a baby monitor.,Yes
"Very good App for my foscam IP Cameras, configurable preset action, multiple camera Support.",Yes
"Hello, can you add a function to get the sound of a camera mode multicamera please.On my iPad, LiveCamsPro application has this feature and I would like to have it on my android tablet too.Is it also possible to not automatically hide a status bar on the tablet, thank you.Thank you in advance.",Yes
"this thing is great, easy to use, but doesn't give you control abilities. hello hello hello hello hello hello",Yes
great app ever I get to see were I never thought I would  of sal when my bro sees it he laughs at me :(,Yes
Synced up perfectly with my Sharx (SCNC2607) networkedsecurity camera that I use as a baby monitor. Works much better on my Fire than the native web interface. No complaints.,Yes
great. i use it all the  time to keep track of my elderly parents.  thanks for creating the app.  very very nice.,Yes
I don't get it it's just a camera that shows like not a lot of stuff I thought it like makes. videos,Yes
"The app works great for reading and annotating PDFs.  I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1, and I'm finding it fairly intuitive to use the tools to mark up PDFs with the stylus.  But there is a bug or some other problem that has caused me a big headache.  Twice, my marked-up document has disappeared from storage, causing me to have to redo hours' worth of work.  This happened with two different documents.  I carefully saved after each change I made, and I made note of the file name and location, but the next day, in each case, the file was completely gone.  I searched through my entire file system and did not find it, and the storage location itself (PDFMax folder on the internal storage card) had been wiped.Until I find an alternative app, I am saving to my Dropbox account, which is slower and very clunky, and apparently has not saved the changes I re-made after losing the original file.  I really need an app that will reliably save changes and not delete files.  I thought this was it.  It is not.  Too bad, because other than that big deal-breaker, it works very well.",Yes
"This would be a fantastic app except for one big thing ... highlight, underline and strikethrough all all yellow! That's fine for the highlighter. Strikethrough should be red; underline should be green or bright green. It is impossible to see either of these two on a white background (not all pages are viewable in night mode) and this is how other apps like Adobe do it.Currently, to use underline or strikethrough, you longpress on the word, drag the tabs and then tap on underline or strikethrough. Then you have to tap elsewhere on the page; and then retap the word so it in an editing box, select the color pallete and set the strikethrough or underline color ... EVERY TIME!There are no options to set the default colors of these three actions, and that's what is keeping it from being a great app.",Yes
"Update 6-17-2015I rescanned this software after I reinstalled it.  I did this due to several reviews that claimed malicious code was added like access to your accounts and other items.  While there were some changes to the permissions. they are not catastrophic or particularly invasive and I believe they were added for licensing purposes.  I added more data on the permissions below showing the older and the new permissions list..????????? files are very common and I use them all of the time.  I get documents, books and forms from many companies in PDF format and having a good PDF reader is very helpful on your tablet.  This reader is a nice powerful PDF reader and it allows you to mark up your PDF file read and annotate it.  You can even add a voice memo to the file.There is a navigation bar on the LH side of the screen and you can even word search.  You get a full set of tools to use on the PDF and you can copy text, paste, delete, email, rotate the page or even extract pages.This is an office tool that everyone needs for their tablet or smart phone and here is a free offer to get it so you should download it.  I experienced one problem using it on my Samsung Tab 4 when the app stopped working and shut down,  for that I will delete one star.

I scanned a multiple page document at work.  When I opened it in PDF Expert the document was unreadable because the pages were offset such that it looked like the scan started half way through the page. At first I thought there was a page sizing issue but I opened the scan in a different PDF reader at the pages displayed correctly so the issue is with PDF Expert. I have other PDFs that displayed properly in PDF Expert but I may as well stick with my other PDF reader that works for all my PDFS.,Yes
"I have been testing PDF reading/editing/annotation apps the past few days and was fortunate enough to get PDF max on the &#34;app of day&#34; offer.This is by far the fastest, easiest and effective tool to annotate and edit PDF files. I wouldn't have thought by the reviews how good it actually is.I have only one problem with it:It does not support a 'crop' function for the surrounding white areas around the text.You can't believe how much this helps reading, much more than the reflow text option, at least for tablets.So I am still torn between my favorite PDF reader, ebookdroid, and the best editor, PDF max.If only the developer would include this option! Then it would deserve the whole 5 stars.",Yes
"Search function is ""non-functional"", meaning it does not perform any search.""All files"" displays directories which you have to drill down to chose your file. It should display all PDF files in your system regardless of locations.""un-install"" is my next course of action.",Yes
Just starting out with this app shows much promise.  The capabilities are useful and the lack of permissions is even thoughtful. I'm quite pleased so far and it appears to be well worth the purchase price.,Yes
"Wasn't really what I thought it was, so uninstalled.  Sometimes things just don't work out, and this was one of those times.  Probably not the fault of the app.",Yes
"Works well for my needs. Easy interface and intuitive controls.  No issues to this point, and I've used it quite a bit already.",Yes
"I got this app as an FAOTD and use it mainly to annotate PDFs. It has so many features, including signing PDFs, that I uninstalled Adobe Acrobat to make this my main PDF app. I love that I can have multiple PDFs open, they open immediately, and the annotation options are customizable. Deleting annotations is also easy.Two things I don't like:* I can't edit files on my external card. (Hopefully this changes in Lollipop.)* I keep getting a blank notification that doesn't go away until I open the program, and there are no notifications setting controls. I'm hoping it was just pestering me to rate and will now go away permanently.",Yes
I love this app but the developer will hopefully fix this soon and I'll change it to a 4.  Speed control will earn it a 5.,Yes
"Even more popular than Microsoft Word documents are PDFs. In all likelihood, PDFs are the most abundant forms of standalone document people encounter in their daily lives.[PRIVACY: Zero problematic permissions! Yay!]This means a PDF reader is exceedingly important.  This one is more than a reader, it is a powerful annotator, which is one step down from a full-blown editor.  As far as annotators go, this one is very powerful.  It has the usual highlights, bookmarks, and comments. It also has shapes, free style, and many more annotations. It even allows different color combinations, coming close to an image editor in this fashion.Hidden, though, are even more powerful tools, such as the ability to copy, rearrange, concatenate (combine), delete, split (extract), and so forth.Instead of using my tablet for testing, I chose to use my phone which is a ZTE 5"" Virgin Mobile Supreme / Sprint Vital.The app handled a >100MB file with hundreds of pages and chock full of images. It handled it so well, in fact, that even my more powerful Samsung Note 10.1 using RepliGo Reader doesn't do as well!The Dropbox integration works very well, and is very helpful.By the way, unlike RepliGo Reader which required me to have an internet connection the first time I used it, this didn't require any internet access or account.Two of the best features involve audio. You can attach a voice memo; I didn't test more than a few seconds, so I'm not sure how long of a message you can embed.  The second, and even better, feature is the TTL voice reading which works quite well. It highlights the passages it is reading, too.  The only downside is that you can't pause and resume, which admittedly is a big deal, and one that hopefully will be implemented.There are a couple more downsides: the resolution of scans are poor due to heavy compression.  Also, there are no instructions and no settings.  I'd love to have more control over certain things, and some documentation would help people find those deeply hidden yet so helpful tools.Despite these downsides, this is an extraordinary PDF tool!  I really like my RepliGo Reader, but this will replace it as my go-to PDF tool from here on out.SUMMARY: More than a PDF reader, this is a powerful PDF tool, giving your Android as much power as any PC annotator I've found.BOTTOM LINE: Get it. Absolutely.",Yes
"Please Please fix the annotation flattening! This would be an awesome app if I could flatten, making it possible to email and print my documents with my annotations included. Right now I do my annotations in PDF Max and then open the document in ezPDF to flatten.

Still no reply from the company.  What I thought was a problem fixed, turned out to be a bigger problem.  I contacted the company again on January 3. No reply. The ""flatten"" feature is really strange.  It saves a separate copy of the document rather than flattening the current document.  Tried to find the saved ""flattened"" document and it was nowhere to be found.  I have gone back to Foxit.  Foxit works OK and serves the purpose (and it is free).  I really wish Mobeera would reply and help me with the ""flattening"" issue because (other than that) I really like the features on PDF Max Pro...",Yes

Not the snap chat I thought it was,Yes
My son likes snapchat so I thought this was one of amazons knock offs..  This app is totally annoying and it is only lists of usernames to add on snapchat and it puts your username on the list so RANDOM bug a boo's can constantly add you and send you chats. I logged off and uninstalled the ANNOYING APP and my username is STILL on there and people are still getting my info and adding me and sending chats √∞??¬† it's really frustrating to the point where I want to uninstall my REAL SnapChat! Please fix it to where your username Is OFF the list when UNINSTALLED!,Yes
I thought I was getting regular snapchat.. I was disappointed.,Yes

It wasn't what I thought it would be.,Yes
"I thought this was snap chat , it is NOT!!!!! It suck! I want the real snapchat, not some fake crap√∞???",Yes
Kinda fun....thought it was the social media but it's not it's to get ppl...so you can add them...it's a search engine!,Yes
This app is b.s u need a snapshat account in order to have it!!!! If u thought u would just be able to talk to people than ur completely wrong ........... don't waste your time getting it... it will just be easier to get the regular one...,Yes
"This makes me give at least one star to submit a review. It performs to search and have more friends added. Not the actual app, as I thought it would be. I have the app on my android smart phone & downloaded this to my Kindle Fire...NOT THE SAME! I do not recommend this app.",Yes
Is not at all what I thought it would be I thought that if you logged out people couldn't see your Snapchat anymore but yeah people e still snapchatting me and its really weird like nooooo,Yes
"This is a simple , not bad , get the job done router. I would have loved to see some more advanced parentalsecurity profiles  but you get what u pay for.

The other genres (adventure, city building) are supposed to provide an interesting and engaging rationale for the dozens upon dozens of repetitive Match 3 rounds you'll be playing. However, if you like Match 3 games a lot to begin with, you won't need this rationale, and if you don't, the rationale/sideshow in this game probably won't be enough to keep you playing. What this game really is--and, in this, it's exactly like a thousand other games--is a surfeit of busywork game mechanics designed to coax your money from your wallet in all the usual ways. It's no worse than those thousand other games in this respect, but it's no better, either.Bottom line: if you like Match 3 games, the core gameplay here is solid and silly-free. If you don't, or if you're put off by stuff getting constantly thrown in the way of your Match 3 joy, you'll probably not be very long in invoking your Ultimate Spell of Uninstall. (And, obviously, if you're one of those who avoids coin whore, IAP games on principle, you'll want to miss this one out, although IAP's arent technically necessary in order to complete the game, AFAICT.)",Yes
I enjoy this game very much! play daily! Wish energy was free! I like the feeling that I am creating something! Native encouragement  and direction are good. feels like  I am helping others in something important,Yes
Keeps me challenged.,Yes
"I like the challenges and the story line. Cute addition for a history buff. Only hitch - when I reached the higher levels, the game began to crash and I had to delete the data and start over. Not thrilled with that.",Yes
It challenges me to use my brain and at 60 years old I need all the help I can get.,Yes
Love this game calmas my nerves fun and a bit hard so challenge like I like my games,Yes
A lot of fun to play. I like the challenge.,Yes
For a while I thought I had found a game where you could actually play for free and get some progression. Silly me.  Had a five day event where you earned crystals and if you reached 160 you'd get to keep however many you earned. Reached 160 two days before end of event and game said I could pay $11.99 to get the bank early. Event ended late last night so logged in today and got a message I could buy the 200 crystals I had earned for $11.99. Slick. Obviously this is only going to get worse.,Yes
"Love the challenge, fun to play!",Yes
"This game is fun to play, has great  graphics,  not to hard but hard enough to mAke it a challenge. However on my 10"" kindle it stops working a lot. But this tablet has a habit of being unstable  so the game could  not be at fault.",Yes
"This game tries to be a little bit of everything (match 3, planting, exploring, battling) and only succeeds in doing nothing well. And it has the worst of all qualities--it is boring. I am removing it from my device and from my cloud.",Yes
This is the absolute best match 3 adventure game ever. I hope the levels never end. I am hooked!,Yes
Enjoying the challenges and variety,Yes
I have to say I am totally surprised by how much fun I have playing this game! It's not so easy that you get bored and it does have some challenges to it. I play it until I'm completely out of energy. I recommend this game to anyone who wants to have fun playing a game you can enjoy... I'm editing my review because with all of the new things that they have added now the game really is FUN.....,Yes
Continues to be a challenge and fun.,Yes
"I really enjoy the challenge of the game and the graphics , but to obtain diamonds to advance to the next level involves money, for which I have little,so continuously play level two. Thank you. .",Yes
"This game can be fun, however it plays slowly on my kindle. Reactions to touch often take two touches to perform.",Yes
I thought I wouldn't like this app. But I can't seem to be able to put it down. Love this app. Lot's of fun.,Yes
This game is exciting and fun to play. Loads of excitement and challenging to play.,Yes
"Great game, lots of different challenges. I just wish all these games were not geared to rip off real money. That gets very very old.",Yes
"I love the game and hope that they update it soon.They say it needs update forsecurity reasons.Please hurry so I can continue to play. I find the game to be exhilarating,exciting,and just packed full of fun,adventure,and the levels you can go are fantastic.I look forward to the game each day.So please hurry and update OK!! Thank You Vivian.",Yes
Fun for kids of all ages and skill levels fun an challenge.,Yes
I enjoy this game. Each level brings more excitement,Yes
"Fun, quick, easy, stressless. I don't know what else to say. Not good at reviews. Just get the game and play it. If you don't like it delete it. I'm laying here in bed wanting to get back to game. But I thought I should at least rate it",Yes
"First, the game was difficult to control, second, the text was offensively written.",Yes
"This game is one of my favorite of the games offered for my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9, 64 GB on Amazon.  It has superior graphics, a great storyline and fascinating challenges that keep you totally involved.  I play every day and never get bored.The only criticism that I have is that the number of gifts you can give out to friends is three.  I have a good group of friends playing this game, but I am unable to give them the gifts they deserve.  I would suggest eight gifts per day, one to each gifted.  Also, I would like to see more crystals being rewarded to players.Other than the above, I think you have developed a wonderful game that is in the top five I love to play.  Keep up the creativity.  Thank you for hours of playing pleasure!!!P.S. I would love to see you develop a game similar in style, but about the search for Atlantis.",Yes
"This is a fun game, but there are way too many challenges introduced, each which take way too many components to complete. If they cut these down to a third, it would be more challenging. They way it is now, there isn't much that makes you want to complete a challenge, because there are 20 more going on at the same time.",Yes
I find this game a challenge to play.  Love this game,Yes
"Fun game, lots of challenges to keep you going.",Yes
"This game has the potential of being great fun but there's a whole lot of in-action going on.  Great news - it's free!  That's a plus.  And there aren't a bunch of pop ups trying to get me to spend money.  But there are some.  Bad news - it's slow to open up and it's slow to do everything.  I just want to play the tiles game or the tablets (match 3 and 4).  I don't care about building the village but hey I've built up all this gold and points and emeralds and I don't mind spending those freebies on something but dang it takes so much time and getting to the next game takes forever; like about 10 steps.  I actually look forward to loosing a game because that's the only time the option of replaying that game comes up and it's immediate.So for the game playing itself, I'm in.  But for the whole process, I'm about to uninstall it.",Yes
Fun. Good combo of different challenges,Yes
"Annoying that the only way to have friends is through Facebook, and that there are challenges that require purchases.  But overall a fun game.",Yes
Lots of variety and challenges to this match 3 game.  Love it!,Yes
Awesome addicting game.Love the challenges,Yes
Learning this game.the more I play  the better  I get! There is always a new challenge every dayLove this game!,Yes
"It's a challenge. I play everyday and inch toward the next level. It's satisfying to a point. If you have some money laying around, It's definitely set up to buy your way through it. The daily rewards are crap, need to make it worth coming back. When I play a level for a cat, I want a cat, not a friggin bone (players know what I mean). The occasional app resets are stupid. I've never played a game that resets in the middle of play. I've lost some valuable pieces because of this. Hmm, maybe that's part of the plan...  Anyhow, I started out with 4 stars and ended with 1.",Yes
great challenges and interested in this game.,Yes
A challenge for some.,Yes
I like the game. I enjoy a challenge and adventure. Looking forward to the rest of the game.,Yes
It's a nice game. Lots of  adventures. I would recommend this game to the young and old.,Yes
This is a great match 3game. Very addictive. Love the different challenges..,Yes
Love the. challenges.√¢?¬∫,Yes
"Have the game now a couple of weeks..have to play the same levels over and over and over again to get items...I like a challenge, but this is bordering on rediculous!! Losing interest real fast!! Playing a lot and getting nowhere!",Yes
can't put it down. really enjoy the challenge it has for me right now.,Yes
Enjoying the challenge.,Yes
"Great game, but reaction time is slow.",Yes
Love the game. Very challenging. The only problem with me is I can't play long because it's expensive for in house apps tokens.  One shot is 9-13 tokens and takes 3-4 tries to get one card...I still rated for the 5 Star  challenge...,Yes
"Fun game to play, but is slow. I like the variety of games and challenges.",Yes
"I like the story line, the individual challenges and that you can choose on each level which you want to play. There are different option of how to play... the most challenging for me is the skull thing, without giving to much away..",Yes
"Well, since I can't connect with anyone to help with game play and you don't offer any specials, I really don't play much. Nice concept. Graphics are pretty basic. Love the challenge the boards give, but without help they're too hard to accomplish anything within the time restraints you place on some of the boards. Could have been a great game.",Yes
Great challenge and fun!,Yes
"I have been trying to access cradle of empires for the past week. I thought it needed updating........but NO!!!!! I have removed it and reinstalled, turned off device, looked for updates......nothing.Is there a reason this is happening that I don't know about?It seems other players are having the same problem.",Yes
Played Bejewled for years. Adding in a story line with adventure and treasurer hunting makes it even more fun and interesting to play,Yes
Very fun well thought out game.,Yes
"Beware. Started off as a really fun app. And, yes, I got caught up in buying additional ""jewels"" to spend to get to additional levels. As I continued playing the app, the levels got more difficult--expected--but then it seemed like match 3s were intentionally falling/programmed so that in order to complete a level, I would have to buy more ""jewels"" to get more ""energy points."" I started controlling myself by saying that I would play the game infrequently as my natural energy points built up...it takes about 5.5 hours to restore energy. As I learned not to buy then the app started crashing. I'd get close to winning and the system crashed out and rebooted making me have to start the game over.It is possible that the crashing is unaffiliated with my self control and refusal to buy energy points, but it is suspicious that the game worked perfectly until I learned self-control.I'm hoping that the sudden crashing of my system is just a bug that needs to be fixed but I'll probably delete the game if this continues.",Yes
"The worst thing about this game is that I seem to be addicted!  It's a match three game with quests and story, and interesting challenges.  Much better than that popular game that I used to play.",Yes
"I like this game because it's entertaining and addicting.  The only downside is, it gets hard to collect things you need to go to the next level.  I have actually tried to finish at least 2 collections for about 2 months.  Also, the energy (on the game) you spend, seems to last less and less.Other than those things, the action and story make it fun.",Yes
The added story line and item searches make this an interesting and fun challenge.,Yes
But a fun and well thought out game.,Yes
Easy enough but still enough of a challenge.,Yes
Entertaining storyline. Good challenges to keep you interested.,Yes
I have been playing this game for about a month now and I am loving it.  The challenge gets harder and harder as you go along.  In the beginning it seemed a bit easy but no longer.  Thanks for creating a game that gives me a great challenge!,Yes
I'm having more fun than I thought I would! Will recommend.,Yes
"I was very disappointed in this game. All the exciting challenges you see on the advertisings must be far into the game, because at the beginning levels there's nothing different from other ""Match 3"" games. You also can't play very long without needing to spend real money for more lives, or whatever they call it in this game. I deleted the game and won't get sucked in again.",Yes
"Cradle of Empires is a base building/match 3 game. When I got C radle of Empires, I was looking forward to a game that focused mainly on the base building game and not so much on the match 3 portion, but I was dissapointed to find it focusing mainly on the match 3 mechanic. At the begining you start off with one builing, and to get more you have to level up. To level up, you have to play the match 3 levels, which each building has 8 of. To even simply upgrade the building, you must get a 3 star on each of these levels. I am a person who does not like match 3 gameplay very much, and so I thought this feature really diminishes the base buildig portion of the game, which it does. So if you are looking for a base builder do not get this game. Also, the story of the game is totally pointless. Mostly, the people of your town, which there are very few of, just want you to find them some pointless item in one of the levels and your reward is just a bit of XP. The whole story of the game is just a collectathon. The game is also very linear because all you do is have someone tell you what to do, do it, repeat. So to me, this game was boring, linear, and pointless. The only reason I gave it a 2 star was because for some people, who like match 3 games more, might actually think this game would be fun and if the creators did a better jobs at the levels, I would too.",Yes
"Whenever I click a gem in the game, there's a half chance it'll register that click as somewhere else on the board, and a quarter chance it won't register the click at all. An example is, earlier today I clicked a gem in the upper right corner of the game board, and it registered the click in the bottom left! Sometimes it's just an adjacent piece, but the location of the selection seems random and completely independent of where I actually touched the screen.Also, there's never enough energy, but the fact I want to keep playing after I've run out must mean I like it.",Yes
Fun distraction,Yes
It's better than I thought it would be.,Yes
I thought it would be more like the ad but I like the Egyptian theme.,Yes
Didn't like this game at all wasn't what I thought it was,Yes
"I love this game, there are so many wonderful levels and surprise additional prize winning adventures.",Yes
Interesting mix of adventure and matching games. Fun so far. Looking forward to explore more levels,Yes
Not much of a challenge. But I have just began playing,Yes
"I would suggest that if you pass a level that your energy isn't deducted. But if you fail it then energy be deducted. It seems fair that way. Also it would be nice if it were more incentives like a tournament or daily challenge. I would like for the game data to be saved ,so if you log in on another device that your progress is saved. Other than that I like the game so far.",Yes
"I would have given 4 stars if I could have been able to connect to Facebook. I sent them an email but they have not responded yet. Otherwise it is a fun game, it's a new twist on a match 3 game which is nice. If you enjoy building things, some adventure, match 3, and goals to meet during the game then this is the game for you.",Yes
Fun enough as a good distraction and time waster,Yes
Like the action and different levels,Yes
It's ok. Has a lot of challenges.,Yes
It keeps my mind challenged.,Yes
Fun game with lots of challenges. Great graphics.,Yes
"Fun  adventure game.  Graphics are decent too. Wish games didn't always try to make extra money from the players.........,",Yes
Quite the challenges!,Yes
I like the adventure this game offers.Thank you,Yes
"Good for a few minutes of fun. Graphics are nice, too. Challenges are very repetitive, though.",Yes
"After putting this on my third Kindle, I am finally learning how to play. Enjoy the game but understanding the steps has been challenging.",Yes
Requires thought,Yes
Game plays better than I thought. No ads!,Yes
"It was my favorite gs me.  However, this game locks up and I have had to restart 3x from the begging and lose my status.",Yes
"The graphics are wonderful, the game is fun and challenging. The upper level games are very challenging. It has good bonuses and I enjoy the game play adventure. I would like to see yet another slot to choose from beside the two girls in the future.  Thanks guys...good job.",Yes
I've had the game for a while and until recently my main complaint was that it didn't update enough so the game didn't grow. I no longer have that complaint so I can now honestly give the game 5 stars. Another reviewer complained that it is hard to earn all five items to complete a collection. I agree but I find that most of my problems are more due to my not searching for the collection items in the order recommended by the game. I've been more concerned with earning the rewards that comes from collecting all the stars within a house than  collecting collection items. But I think that that's the beauty of this game. You see because each person has a different strategy for working the game every person ends up playing a different version of the game. It's frustrating when I'm close but don't complete the puzzles correctly. I hate using the outside aids. But when one puzzle annoys me I either try another puzzle or another house. The games a great indicator of how I'm feeling during a day also. If I keep making careless mistake it means my concentration is shot. I truly enjoy the challenges this game provides.,Yes
The game is fun. I like trying to complete challenges,Yes
Love the graphics and sound tracts. Quite hard at times but I love a good challenge,Yes
"WARNING ABOUT GAME UPDATE:  So, after my review earlier today, I updated my game from the app store.  Immediately it became impossible to play the game.  It kept freezing and freezing and freezing.  You shouldn't UPDATE the game.  Apparently updating will screw up the game play.I tried everything to fix the problem.  I closed and opened the game.  I powered off the Kindle and restarted it.  Finally, I stupidly uninstalled and reinstalled the game.  This works with Panda Pop, because the info shares from Facebook.  But, I should have known, that didn't work for this game.  I ended up at the beginning again, losing all progress.I AM UNINSTALLING THE GAME.  I DON'T HAVE TIME TO PLAY GAMES THAT ARE GLITCHED.  And, I take back my earlier statement, ""This game is lots of fun with many challenging levels and a unique back story.  If people like match three games with a twist, this is the game for them.""  The game IS fun, and I like a challenge, but I don't want to have to deal with customer service people every time I update a game.  So, be aware that updates may screw you up.  Good luck to all you other players, but I'm out of here.",Yes
Not as much fun as I thought it would be,Yes
"This kept coming up as an ad while playing spider solitaire. Thought it might be interesting, wrong! It spends so much time doing inane thinvs on the screen, and without telling you why, that you quickly get tired of plsying along and not actually playing.",Yes
"Fun, though still chock-full of micro transactions.",Yes
"Could be a confusing but fun journey. Don't know where to go next in this game, so if your heads not in move on to simpler games. The challenge is rum, so far.",Yes
The game is totally mesmerizing and thought provoking. The developers have done a great job but are still listening to customers an making improvements asked for.,Yes
"Too often, I waste time trying to make my next move.  This is especially ridiculous on timed games.  First, I have to wait to move, and that includes even when I attempt your selection.  Then, when I can finally select a square, the game moves it where it wants, not allowing me to make a move.  You can make suggestions, but they shouldn't keep me from moving and you should NEVER, EVER override my  choices!  This has stopped me from progressing as I see no way to handle timed mode as you  control the board.  I am playing the Kindle version.  Other version s may be more honest.",Yes
"Super fun and challenging. When I need to kill some time or just to keep my brain cells working. Wonderful characters that give you the story lines. Have been looking for NEW game to challenge me, this is it.",Yes
"I like this game and wanted to play and even spent over $50. playing. However it quickly became no fun. I don't know who thought it is fun waiting 10 hours to regain your playtime (@ 200 energy for example) or losing every game during those few minutes of play. The games requirements to win are mostly impossible unless you buy tools from the store. The blitz mode can be as low as 15 seconds, the games that have obstacles that reappear do so twice as fast as you items moving off the board, collections are hard to combine because several collections need the same item and they are not readily given. Or match 100 each of two different items in a minute thirty seconds. This game requires too much money to progress. When games stop being fun or interesting it's time to move on.",Yes
I love the game on!y if you so  you should gIn a life not loose  life.Just  good thought,Yes
Quests and characters make this an adventure!,Yes
"This game is a ripoff! I know. How can a free game be a ripoff? As you complete match challenges, you collect special items. If you need a specific item you can tap on it and it will direct you to the exact match puzzle you need to complete to get that item. Good luck with that, 'cause it'll probably take you three days to get it. What's the point? You NEED these items to progress. I'm done. Way more match games out there. Sad because I love their PC games, like Cradle of Persia. This one sucks.",Yes
"There's enough challenges in the game to keep it interesting, however overdone the storyline might be.",Yes
This match 3 game is loads of fun to play! It has an Egyptian theme and has many different challenges to give you an opportunity to solve the puzzles. Solve the match challenge to find a needed item to help you advance. Try it! You'll like it!,Yes
"Love the variety of challenges and I love the actual match 3 game play, but everything costs way too much. I get that the app is free and all but this game is kinda pushy with them wanting you to spend money.",Yes
Fun challenge game but it keeps saying there's an interval problem & causing problems to play,Yes
Game is fun. Challenges are easy. What I don't like is the long wait for energy. Other than that a good game.,Yes
Love the challenge but it's obviously rigged at certain points.,Yes
At this point I am finding the game to be a bit tedious.  I like the playing screens but don't care for the interaction in between with the game's characters.  I don't want to have to read and prefer to simply advance to the next level and keep playing.,Yes
Fun  Game lots of challenges.  Keeps your interest.  Just don't like buying stuff in the game.  I try not to.,Yes
Challengeing  game.  Love it,Yes
"I am enjoying this game so far. The graphics are terrific, and game play is intuitive. The challenges are doable without making purchases so far. It's a nice light puzzle game for stretching your brain and passing some leisure teaching.",Yes
Love all the different challenges they combine.,Yes
Just don√¢??t like the game. It√¢??s not what I thought it was,Yes
I wasn't sure when I downloaded this app but it has a nice story line that the puzzles fit into.  They are challenging but build so I felt like I was ready for the next challenge as it progressed.  Fun game.  Can spend money in it but don't have to.,Yes
Love it each puzzle is an challenge.  Give it a try,Yes
"Addictive.  Have spent too much, but like the challenges.",Yes
Love the story and the challenge.,Yes
A unique way to learn about an ancient culture and way of life.  Needs a little more instruction/hints when required to build new structure.  Love the additional challenge of night vision.,Yes
"The concept is great and the puzzles are challenging, but I feel as if the app aggressively pursues in game purchasing. Within a few days I ran into challenges where in game currency was a must or I would be stuck at the same puzz!e indefinitely. I haven't run into a puzzle game, until now, that stopped being fun and started reaching for my wallet in only a few day's time. The devs are also kinda stingy in the free power ups and free gems department from what I have seen, which hampers free to play gamers. Add to that issues with the program realizing that the board has no moves, which can take seconds. If Columns in the 90's could react immediately to a board with no moves, I expect the same from an app in 2017, especially one that wants my money so badly.But, yeah, cool concept.",Yes
"I'm sure it's a fun game for some, but I found it a little confusing. Just when I thought  had a level completed it took me back to do over?",Yes
I just didn't like it as much as I thought I would.,Yes
Fun but would like a few different challenges vs just moving tiles to now up the boxes.,Yes
Love the way the village grows and some of the matching games are a challenge.,Yes
"I find that I am playing this game more than I thought I would.  But, for those of us getting on in years there are certain aspects that are a little too challenging. You are required to play in timed mode often, and the time allotted is quite small. Also it has a faded mode which if your eyesight isn't great is already hard, but they also put a fast timer on that one too.  What I try to do is play on one of the other modes and hope the one I need will eventually change to an easier mode, which is probably why I have been playing it more than I thought I would. You also have to complete collections which can be quite costly because the item you need never seems to surface. So I have a lot of uncompleted collections waiting to be filled because I don't want to spend my charger items on something now when I may need it more later.",Yes
Every time I open app it says downloading and it does nothing. Status shows it's downloading nothing an is stuck at this point for over a week now. Deleting this app.,Yes
"Uses a lot of energy,  and seems to lack excitement",Yes
"Too slow, challenges do not pay off in promised reward.",Yes
"This is a great game!  I wish there was a PC version, I would even play it more. You can play without having to make purchases, if you have patience a good impulse control, but the game is so good you really want to keep playing.  My issues are it will not update on my Kindle Fire and would not load onto my new  Kindle Fire HD",Yes
Really good and fun. Lots of challenges and levels. Can play for hours. Gotta try this one.,Yes
"The challenges to complete a level are good and also frustrating at times, especially when the view is blocked.",Yes
Overall well done game. My only complaint is the night challenge is seriously flawed. The city building is a nice twist.,Yes
Great app full of fun and excitement.,Yes
"I love how you can build up to 3 stars and the levels change from numbered moves to timed and such makes it fun since its not always the same thing. That being said I don't like having to buy things, why not make a special challenge or things to collect to make a potion for extra energy, that would be great.",Yes
I really enjoy this game. I think the creator were very clever when they designed it. I have been hooked since I started to play. I love all the different challenges and things to do.,Yes
Fun game. Just enough challenge to keep me playing,Yes
"I just bought a new Kindle and thought I'd try a new game. While the Kindle doesn't have any problems with other games, it is very slow with this game. Tapping on a dialogue box or selecting an item is often an exercise in futility. I could tap until the cows come home, but nothing will happen. How frustrating it is.",Yes
Enjoy the challenges,Yes
I love playing this game. Each level brings new challenges. Just wish the storylines were less lengthy. I don't care about the story as much as the challenges.,Yes
Love the challenges,Yes
I am enjoying the challenge of the game so far but am weary of the attempts to get you to spend money.,Yes
"This app has speed, timing, and a great thought process.",Yes
Challenging game. Lots of fun. Constantly updating and adding new challenges. Been playing for 3 years.,Yes
It has been a long time since a game has challenged me. I am enjoying myself. I look forward to playing this game.,Yes
Addictive in a good way.  Different levels and challenges that keeps one challenged.  I have been able to advance without any money spent.,Yes
"Fun and addicting.  I test my skills every day!  Different challenges provide choice in play and keep you from getting ""stuck"" on a level.  Very enjoyable.",Yes
"If you like challenges and suspense, this game is for you.",Yes
"Great game, love the challenges",Yes
"Enjoy this game very much, pretty addicting. Very fun to play. Thank you!Update: been playing game for 4 or 5 months, I play every day. Yes still addicting. The puzzles are a challenge it makes it more fun. But at time discouraging. But I move on to another, and go back and get it over with lol. The developers are just awesome the are very nice and understanding. It my first experience having awesome developers!!! And I've played many games! Thank you so much!",Yes
very enjoyable to play. Some challenge and some fun,Yes
Not what I thought it was going to be. Just wanted to do the puzzles without all the hassle.,Yes
Great fun and challenges. Best match 3 game I have played yet!,Yes
Quick challenges.Lots of variety,Yes
"I love a challenge. This match three combines chess-like strategy with an interesting peek at ancient Egypt. As your levels increase, eventhough the boards look the same, the puzzles become more difficult. I love the artwork. For me, that's a bonus.",Yes
I enjoy a challenge!!,Yes
"The game is great when getting though the matching process but like most games of this nature players are nickel and dime to death to keep progressing.  I was very sad,  I truly enjoyed the game until I recognized exactly how much it was costing me.  I wish Amazon would bring back the underground",Yes
This is a fun game. You could play it without the in game purchases.  A few purchases will make the game a little easier and let you play a little longer.  Challenges get harder as you master the game so you don't get bored. I wish there were fewer pop-up in game purchases notifications but I am just impatient.,Yes
I like the challenges that u have to clear the board to earn your prizes.I also like the color scheme.,Yes
I like that the puzzles are challenging and require thought to finish them. Great game to play that keeps you coming back for more.,Yes
Many exciting play formats.  Always a challenge and great fun!,Yes
Obtaining collection pieces is absurdly difficult... Been trying to get this one piece for weeks... I understand challenge...but this is crazy,Yes
not what I thought it would be,Yes
I thought it was a hard game to play,Yes
I love this game. It has just enough challenges that keeps me entertained.,Yes
"I Download this game and thought it going to be boring . I started to play, now I can not stop playing it's challenging.",Yes
It wasn't what I thought it would be.,Yes
I wasn't sure about this game. I thought that it was like many of the match three games. This one kept me Interested. I need to get some sleep but can't put it down.,Yes
lots of fun creating new Indians huts and bildings,Yes
"Love the game but it's so slow moving at advancement and don't get me started on how little energy they give you for playing rounds as you level up you should get more energy to play the rounds oh that's right you have to buy a ton of gems for energy which is always the problem with these games. I love playing games and am very particular on the games I do play so I don't have very many downloads of games then there's the ones that rip you off was playing a game and was very high level wise I bought some gems for that game and was vCard ripped off twice each 10.00 I don't know about other players but I budget for this entertainment and can't afford to be ripped off so I quit playing that game I truly wish I could design a game because I would make it affordable and have quest that earned you your gems or whatever the need to buy items, energy or whatever the need.let's say I could design a game just don't know how to do technically. But this game could be so much better. Needs faster advancement, more energy to play levels and way to earn gems besides buying them. These games are all about the in game purchases which is sad cause you know Xbox,PlayStation, Nintendo and other gaming system games don't require all those purchases for advancement they wouldn't stay in business much less buy games that requires in game purchases just saying. Independent game developers and designers who want to advance in the gaming world would become more popular if they just had more to offer gamers that love playing games on their kindle(like me) or iPad which I refuse to buy Apple products because everything has to be bought that's Apple compatible I'm strictly a droid person and I got hooked on kindle gaming because my children and ex husband were always on the Xbox or PlayStation or Wii which I got so I could game but it was taken over also so I'm pretty stuck gaming on my kindle, laptop or phone which I now enjoy except for in app purchases and or slow moving games. Guess I had a mouthful but frustrated by most game app's.",Yes
"This game is a real challenge. I love the way you can earn awards. Love playing. ONLY ONE THING WRONG! COST TOO MUCH MONEY FOR ME. I'M ON SSI, I'M RETIRED. SO I'M ON AREALLY STRICT BUDGET, SO SADLY I DON'T GET TO PLAY OFTEN ENOUGH. I STILL LOVE THIS GAME THOUGH.√¢¬ù¬§",Yes
"I like this game. BUT, it's almost too difficult for the genie challenge. Then, when I buy more crystals to continue 1 more move, I don't get them. My email says I purchased them, but not there. It'll probably be there after this review, but pointless now. This has happened before, but losing my patience.",Yes
Its entertaining and challengeing. Beautiful scenery  too. Definitely worth installing to pass the time way.,Yes
"I've only been playing this game a couple of hours and so far, it's really good. It's basically just like any other Match 3 game with the added challenge of rebuilding a city.You get coins and other resources that have to be spent wisely to rebuild the various parts of the city.Just like other Match 3 games, you use energy for each puzzle that you solve but the energy replenishes over time.All in all, a good game considering the Match 3 gameplay. So far, I'm having fun and...we'll just see how far I can get!!!",Yes
Is a nice game with a challenge,Yes
I really like doing 3 match games but with this one it's also an adventure.,Yes
Fu. Game with a little challenge.,Yes
It's a fun game with  exciting quests and cool adventures!,Yes
"The cursor is a bit tough to control during night mode, but otherwise pretty fun to play. Finding the items gives you a specific goal which is missing in many match 3 games.",Yes
Thank you for the adventures..,Yes
"I'm not sure I understand the whole concept, but I'm enjoying the challenges.",Yes
I've been playing the game for two straight days now. Lots of fun and lots of challenges!,Yes
"I thought it would be fun to play this game, but couldn't figure out how & wish I hadn't bothered.",Yes
"This has a lot of action. I love √∞???that I can move around, it keeps me very into the game. √∞???√∞???√∞???",Yes
"I've been playing the game for about a year now and am thoroughly addicted. Other match three games are fun for a while, but then you get to a point where you can't progress without spending money. I do spend money on this game...but you don't HAVE to. I like the different buildings who's games are all different. I LOVE the daily tasks! My only gripe it's that the chargers are so hard to collect. There is something to challenge just about anyone...between the daily tasks, the story books, the mini games, etc. Great game!",Yes
not what I thought it was Uninstalled.,Yes
"Fun to play, lots of different challenges!",Yes
"this is a fun game, always a challenge, very entertaining",Yes
"I have enjoyed playing this game. I do wish that I could play it on my lap top, but it is not available to play on it. I would like to be able to go further in each challenge, but to do that one must buy energy in order to continue if you don't want to wait for it to build up.I am not paying any money just to play a game, so this is why I did not give 5 stars. I like the game but the asking to pay for energy etc. in order to continue I feel is wrong. There should be a way that one can do something to earn more energy points instead of paying money for it.I would recommend the game to others.",Yes
Fun way to play an adventure game in a match three format.,Yes
"Really enjoy this match 3 game that has different challenges and fails to bore. Amazes me the programming that has gone on and contines, great game!",Yes
"So far I'm really enjoying this game. Some levels are harder than I thought they would be, but it's still enjoyable to play.",Yes
Wasn't what I thought it was. Didn't match the description that was shown.,Yes
Beautiful grafics while the challenges become tougher with each step! Perfecto!!,Yes
"This game is both fun and challenging. Once you build up your energy reserves and experience level that allow you to play longer, you will be addicted to this game. I like that it's not yet another square pushing jewel game, but rather it's a combination of tactical and puzzle game. Very interesting, makes you want to play more and search for all the items to continue the village restoration. You never know what you will find, plus daily quests for special prizes, and holiday challenges are fun.Two things that would greatly improve this game is to allow users to purchase gems through Google play rather than having FB as the only option. Also unless you are FB user you won't be able to sync this game across multiple devices.",Yes
"I've been playing this game for about 9 months.  Thought it was fun so kept playing.  I refuse to pay actual money for the gems so reading the reviews inspired me to quit this game as the farther along you go, the more you'll need to pay actual money to continue.  But my biggest concern is my inability to shut down my brain when I go to bed.  I see the moves jumping around in my head and have a really hard time falling asleep.  I bought blue-light reducing glasses to help with this problem but didn't appear to help much.  So I decided to quit playing the game.  It's been about 2 weeks now that I haven't played the game, and I am finally able to fall asleep the way I used to prior to playing this game.  I'm wondering if it's all similar games and not just Cradle of Empires.  Anyone else having this problem?  My sleep is more important than playing a game so no more games for me.  I'm going to go to the library and loan out actual books instead.",Yes
"I like the variety of the puzzles. You can pretty much relax and play the game however you want, regarding if you want to actively build up the city and get new puzzles or not. I find it rather relaxing (except for the timed puzzles). It did take me awhile to build the ship, but I admit I wasn't trying very hard. There are different events that happen where you can spend your resources to play instead of energy. I've never been able to actually complete an event yet, but they are a nice diversion. I actually like having a limit on my energy, or I might spend more time playing the game and not getting anything done in real life! It can be a challenge with a bit of luck involved with how the pieces dropped, but it's not as difficult as Homescapes and overall much more enjoyable!",Yes
Graphics are good. Game is fun with some variety and  challenge. This game is addictiveThe cost of of the energy is high. That is why I can't give it five stars.,Yes
It was a bit boring. Not a lot of real excitement to it. Sorry,Yes
Just started playing. Fun with some interesting challenges.,Yes
"I have played the PC predecessors of this game and am familiar with the various challenges/roadblocks than many people whine about. I'm at level 29 and have spent nothing. My complaint or caution is that sometimes my moves are misread and my choice is ignored ...moves on the far side of the screen occur that I didn't choose to make. This frequently causes a loss of the level I am playing. Game updates have improved but not eliminated the problem. When you are playing a timed level, this can REALLY be a source of anger and frustration!",Yes
Love this game!  It keeps me entertained and it's not boring. It's a challenge.  Love all the side games that are included in this game.  Thanks for making it fun!!!,Yes
I like the game offers a challenge and extra side games nice,Yes
"Love the concept, the story, and the different challenges.",Yes
"I've played role adventures before, but this one goes nowhere.",Yes
So far this match 3 quest game delivers nice little challenges without being tedious or frustrating.,Yes
I can't seem to keep up with the action games .  This is great .  I found out that I'm good at matching threes.,Yes
Great game. Gets harder as you progress. Lots of fun levels. Variety of different challenges in March 3 puzzles.,Yes
I don't care for this game. I would not order it . I do not recommend this to anyone. It's my thought. Maybe some one else would like it. I don't. Thanks. Kathy,Yes
Wasn't what I thought it would be.,Yes
Once I start playing this game it's hard to stop. The game challenges you in a way that gets you to challenge yourself. It's more of an adult game match 3 than children and I enjoy it for hours!,Yes
Terrific game with a lot of levels and challenges!,Yes
great scenery  and story. I thought it would be hard but it is relaxing!,Yes
"I thought you would babe ""purchasing"" the gems you need with the coins you earned solving puzzles.  No the coins come from your wallet.  I've bought my last. When I run out the game will be deleted.",Yes
Good graphics and fun holiday challenges,Yes
"Thought it was just going to be like a jewel blitz type game.. I was bored with all the other side stuff, like build a village, go back to the shop, buy a hoe for the garden, etc.  No sooner had I downloaded (thinking it was something else) I un-installed it.  Just not for me.",Yes
"I like the game, but it is a micro-transaction game. If you want to progress quickly, you will need to pay money. I am not opposed to paying now and then. I have not run into a situation where progressing required a cash outlay. I have, however, only played for a day or so.",Yes
I enjoy the challenges this game gives me.  There are so many different ways to play and You do not have time to get bored with it. You are challenged in so many ways and it is a delight to see what works and what doesn√¢??t.,Yes
This game challenges my mind. One of the best games I've ever play.,Yes
"Like the app and the different challenges (night vision, blocks) but the pauses between screens gets annoying.",Yes
"I have really enjoyed this game, this is a nice change of pace with match 3, building, and adventure in one game. The main problem is running out of energy after completing a few levels and you having to purchase the resources if you  want to continue on. That's the main reason for not rating it higher.",Yes
Great game.  Full of challenges.  Love it.,Yes
Good variation of boards and bonuses.  Well thought-out &#34;story&#34;.,Yes
Multiple levels of challenges. Sometimes options are confusing.,Yes
Lots of fun! Great combo of matching  game with building and adventure game. Nice music and graphics. Fun for everyone!,Yes
"It starts simply, then the challenges get harder. its a nice little matching game. no money required.",Yes
"I really like this game. But I played for days without understanding the rules. The graphics are beautiful but I don't think the price for gems is fair, and I had 82 points left and they didn't carry over . I paid extra for them too",Yes
"I didn't think that I had to build thing's in this game , I just thought it was just a matching game! So the game is ok!!",Yes
"Let me preface this by saying that there's a lot this game gets right.  Graphics are gorgeous, sound is very good, concept is intriguing, and the story is meaty without being overdone.But the aggravation in CoE is greater than the sum of its minor annoyances.First up, it's Match 3, and so there are times when you're going to be left with squares near the top of the board that can only be matched with a lucky drop.  By itself, it's a minor annoyance, but that's the nature of Match 3.But then, after you pass the level, there's a chance you may not even find the object you're questing for.  You read that right:  even if you DO get past a level, you may still come away empty-handed.  True, you'll always get SOMETHING after a completed level; but whether or not that ""something"" is of any actual value, well...An example:  I'm looking for one specific charger that I need to finish a main story quest.  I've been searching where the game sends me for TWO DAYS at this point, and that ONE little item that I need, just flat-out REFUSES.  TO.  SHOW.  UP.  Again, by itself, it's a minor annoyance; low drop rates for quest items aren't unheard of.  But a low drop rate for quest items on the back end, after I've already had to deal with enough of a luckfest in the upfront game, adds up the annoyance in a hurry.But the topper is that it's energy-based, and you can only make so many attempts before having enough energy to take another atttempt.  This one item I'm looking for, is in an area that takes 11 energy; at three minutes per energy unit, that means a 33-minute cooldown if I run out.  By itself, it's a minor annoyance; energy meters are almost a fact of life in high-end FTP's.  But when you add it to the other two...Let me put this as succinctly as I can.  By itself, I have no issue with losing a Match 3 level to an unlucky late-stage drop.  By itself, I understand quest items can be hard to find.  By itself, I get that energy meters are the price of FTP gaming.Where I take issue, is having to wait half an hour or more, to play the same area for the twentieth time, hoping that I don't get jobbed by an unlucky drop at the end of the level, in order to, MAYBE, find a quest item that may not even show up.Individually, those are all minor annoyances.  In combination, though, the whole of the aggravation is much worse than the sum of the minorly annoying parts.",Yes
"As a puzzle game I do like Cradle of Empire however, it will take a while to accomplish most of your goals. Some of the collections seem to take forever to get because certain items are not only very hard to find but also some of the items you finally find may be needed for multiple collections and that can be very frustrating.  This game is certainly a challenge and will take you quite a long time to finish unless you are willing to spend actual money on in-game purchases to speed thing up.",Yes
Enjoyable game to challenge your mind and hold your interest,Yes
"This is the  first march 3 building empire game I have played.  The way you can really run your cost up is by buying a few.more moves in an almost completed match 3.  Unless you see the one more move, DO NOT CONTINUE A LOST GAME.  That is really expensive.  You will need to purchase some jewels when you start.  Bide your time.  On the fifth day in a row, the prices come down some.  Spend yr money then.  This is really enjoyable with great match 3 play, and a lot of ways to progress.  But, you lose energy awfully fast.  Do not spend more than you are willing to spend on this game as a whole.  That is why I rated it 4 stars.  It can get very pricey just because you would like to play a little longer.  The game is well thought out.  The graphics are very good.  The play is very interesting.  However, for a newbie, I had/have little understanding of the use of the spells you gradually acquire.  Their explanations of things generally slowly solidify, so that may become clearer later.  The way they get you playing in the game grabbed my interest quickly.  Sorry I cannot compare it to other similar games.H.Scott",Yes
...than I thought it would be. Lots of things to see and do. I don't see myself getting bored with this one anytime soon.,Yes
THE MANY WORDS AND CHALLENGES THROUG OUT THE GAME,Yes
Fun. Lots of challenges. I even downloaded on two devices.,Yes
This game is a matching with a story line to follow.  You can skip reading by going to next challenge.  Fun.,Yes
This is a great game .  I like all of the different levels.  I also like all of  the different challenges.,Yes
"I couldn't uninstall fast enough.  The artwork - though decent - makes the actual game-play tiny and challenging to see.  Also, you can't skip dialogue/story, which pops up before every ""challenge"".  Nor can you skip demonstrations for EASY/OBVIOUS levels.  Not at all what I expected or hoped for, based on the preview.  Too bad, because I thought it had potential for a ""brain exercise break"" game, but it was a huge disappointment and waste of a download -- even though it's free.",Yes
"Very creative and entertaining. Good variety of challenges, but too many timed games--stressful!Lots of updates, but each one brings more unnecessary icons crowding the screen and reducing the size of the playing field.And make the super-irritating piggy bank an optional game like the others.",Yes
I like the interaction and puzzles. I wish the energy regenerated faster though.,Yes
Fun game. It is like exploring a story through matching three. I like all the different area levels to explore as I play and the many different artifacts found and tools needed along the way.I do not like the Facebook presence!,Yes
"This game has become so addicting for me that I have uninstallled all but 1 of my other games. New levels keep me entertained and challenged and unlike many other games that I like, I have not found the levels to become so challenging that I get frustrated and end up feeling like they are unsolvable.",Yes
Played this game before and wasn't very happy with it. I thought I would try it again which I'm glad I did. It appears to have been updated and is much more enjoyable.,Yes
"They keep adding the most annoying sounds and there is no in-app sound control to turn it down, just off for this game. I used to enjoy playing, but can hardly stand the noise now!",Yes
"The ability to build up different areas provides ongoing interest.  The customer support is quick and informative.  Drawbacks are few at this point (i am fairly new to the game), mostly pop-up error messages that make little sense, you will need to purchase items if you want to go far,and interaction with other players needs work.",Yes
"Although the game is fun, beware of this developer! First, I tried to purchase ""jewels"" in order to extend my play and ended up spending over $ 20 because the purchases were never confirmed so I believed they didn't go through.  That left me with 350 jewels to play. When I stopped the game, I had over 300 left.  The next day, that number was 15. I thought I was mistaken about the number so  I purchased a ""package"" that included at least 60 jewels before I shut the game down thinking I would play today.  When I opened the game, there were only 5 jewels remaining and that's because of the daily ""bonus"" of 5 jewels.  This game is a money trap.  I have learned my lesson and will not download any other games from this developer!!",Yes
P!aying for 1 years. Love it. Can get frustrating but then it wouldn't be a challenge.,Yes
Doesn't always tell you how to use things and how to win the challenge.,Yes
"Enjoying this game, like the challenges, fast pace.",Yes
"The story and different tasks are interesting, but it can be very frustrating. Clearing all the tiles in a level is a nice challenge, but trying to figure out why you can clear all the tiles, but still not pass a level is maddening.Retaking the level, may or may not make it clear what else can be done to improve your score.I wish it were possible to purchase the game outright, as opposed to ""buying crystals"" to complete challenges.",Yes
"Fun game, but some challenges are really difficult. Energy drains too fast. Takes forever to get sets completed. Prize wheel is nice, but never lands on the good stuff. Fun, but getting a little frustrated.",Yes
"first of all, i got this game through the google store and have been playing it on my samsung galaxy tab 4.  since my tablet recently stopped working i am looking into getting an amazon fire and wanted to make sure i could get this game on it.  i have read some of the reviews posted here and thought i would add my two cents.  yes you have to play some rounds several times before getting the items you need to complete the collection.  yes it can be frustrating and several times i have put the game aside before returning to it.  but no, you do not need to buy anything.  i don't have the money to buy game add ins yet i have found many items, have several buildings, am up to level 48 and several of my buildings are upgraded.  not once have i bought anything,  give this game a chance it may not be an easy one put it is fun.",Yes
Challenges are good,Yes
"I very much enjoy this game because I have been able to learn while playing, it is challenging, the graphics are beautiful.  HOWEVER, it is also extremely frustating.  I have 2 collections I cannot complete and have been trying for almost three weeks to get the missing chargers.  Even when I manage to complete a challenging level, I get a couple of energy points, nothing substantial.  Seriously annoying.  Oh, and by the way, if you are giving energy points as prizes, considering how quickly energy is used up (as noted in numerous comments here) you could at least make it a larger number.  I also find it very annoying that when I am stuck and unable to clear any of the current quests, no more are made available.  In one of my other games, quests are added regularly, allowing me to go to something new and come back to the older quests.  This would help eliminate the frustration of trying the same game over and over again.  As I have a limited income, I am not free to spend money on crystals which makes it extremely difficult to make any progress.  I will continue playing as I do enjoy the game and the challenges, but I don't know how much longer, due to the high frustration level",Yes
I'm really enjoying this game. I thought I would play it not like it and install it. Well I was very wrong. It's 1:22 in the morning and I think I've been playing it for over an hour. I plan on still playing it until at least 3 in the morning.Thank youCarrie reilly,Yes
"I expect the game to be a challenge, but not a virtual impossibility without spending a boatload of REAL money. Typical company ripping off the little guy. Unless you're a professional gamer, you won't get far without spending the cash.",Yes
"Fun, advancing challenges and quests to keep you coming back",Yes
"I really like this match 3 game, but I find it frustrating in that you just get to playing and you run out of energy to proceed forward unless you either wait until time fills up the energy meter or you give up and buy, with your money, more resources with which to continue the game! The puzzles are fun and evolve in complexity and new challenges as the game progresses. It is a well constructed game.",Yes
I did not authorize this purchase some how my parental control password came off!,Yes
"So my 4 yr old bought this game without my knowledge √∞?¬§¬¶√∞?¬è¬º√¢?¬ç√¢??√Ø¬∏¬è Bad mom for forgetting to setup the parental controls on his new tablet! Anywho, this game is crap! It lags so bad that it√¢??s not even worth playing!!!! I wish I could just get my $14.99 back √∞??? If I could give it zero stars I would!",Yes
OK so I got this game for free and it wasn't good or bad enough I like the graphics but not the controls 50=50,Yes
I'm surprised this is allowed on the appstore.  It looks like it was built in Unity with the out of box car controller in about 10 minutes. Vehicle tires are half way through the pavement.  Other vehicles are halfway through the pavement entirely.  You shouldn't have to purchase coins to upgrade vehicles for something you paid $15 for.,Yes
"My son downloaded on accident for 14.99!!! I was already mad when I saw the transaction, but then I thought, well let me see what it is all about. It is horrible! Controls don't work well, terrible graphics, not a simulation at all! √∞??¬©√∞??¬©√∞??¬©  2 thumbs down!!! √∞???√∞???",Yes
"My kid clicked on it to read about it, then it downloaded without my permission and charged me $14.88 without my knowledge. It's almost a SCAM. I don't recommend it, and make sure to put parental controls to avoid this happen to you.",Yes
My 4 year old somehow purchased this game even though parental purchase controls were in place. I'm not sure how/why this game is still allowed in the appstore as it seems this is a fairly common complaint.,Yes
"I recently tried this app & found it to be very fun. I thought the daily ticket reward for logging in was a good idea. Unfortunately after a week the rewards stopped, apparently to choose another book tickets must be purchased. I enjoyed the app though and the story I chose was well written. I preferred the mystery genre. Downside is I can get through many short stories in a short time, not cost effective. Plus there are not enough choices at this time. Another nice idea is the opportunity for writers to submit stories for consideration. Overall worth keeping an eye on see how things develop.",Yes
"Chapters:Interactive Stories stopped  in mid story. I guess I had to pay or something but, these stories to do it this way when you are half through the story then you have to pay. I thought you had to pay according to the different choice paths that you make and one choice may be free of which is a default choice. I liked the story line but, I wished I could've completed the whole story before it stopped working...",Yes
"I am all about paying for a good book but when you have to pay throughout, you start paying more then you would for a paperback.  I love the idea of adult choose your own adventure stories and the story itself was great but I really didn't want to pay that much.",Yes
"Not as interactive as I thought it would q, but the graphic are great",Yes
This is a great game. It's like the cigar your own adventure books. Really fun to see how it turns out.,Yes
"I've read ALL of the reviews posted on or before 5-10 -19. Often it s seems for Chapters Interactive Stories, the main difference between most of the positive vs. negative reviews is based on the author's ability and/or willingness to spend money on countless micro -transactions to influence the stories. One person wrote that she'd spent $80 during one story. My personal feelings of micro-transactions aside, it's fine if individuals who can afford such things want to spend their money on a suit of armor or a ball gown for character's whose stories have a finite lifespan of 20 chapters, but what many people probably don't realize is even if you don't purchase diamonds or gems depending on the story your engaged with, eventually you'll have to buy the chapters just to finish a story. As soon as I completed chapter 7 and was told it would cost $2.99 for the next chapter, I realized this game wasn't for me and I deleted it.",Yes
There needs to be more interactions and free too,Yes
Really I though there would be more.I thought I would see move ment but just √∞???reading but it is a pretty alsome √∞??¬Ægame√∞???,Yes
"I searched choose you own adventure games for tweens. This popped up. I looked at it first before allowing my daughter to play. The covers of the books or ""chapters"" are basically somewhere between romance novels and soft porn.",Yes
Great story app I re read the one book twice I wanted to see if it had any different story lines or actions to it I read the book in one day even though I had to wait for more tickets I waited patiently lol this does have adult content I would say 21 age group √∞???,Yes
So addictive! Love the stories!! Would love more tickets to view the chapters you only get 1 every 30 mins and max out at 2 a time. Unless u purchase more.  Some books leave u hanging? Big climax to the story then fizzles out and you have no good ending and u look for more chapters but that's it.. Would love more diamonds to control the stories of at least generate them faster ..Would give this app a 10 √∞??? of had more tickets and diamonds more frequently!!!,Yes
I like this a lot more than I thought I would.,Yes
"I was a little disappointed that you have to take less desirable actions because they must be purchased with the in-app diamonds.  You start out with none and they immediately start telling you to buy some.  Stuff like this should only happen to make you keep going when your turn is over.  Otherwise, it is really cute and fun.",Yes
"This is mature content!  I mistakenly got this app for my daughter, thinking by the app name that it was some sort of a choose-your-own-adventure reading activity.  Well, I guess it is, but not the kind I thought.  She never got to play it because I nixed it as soon as I realized.  Not for kids!",Yes
Ridiculous! Every time you complete a book you should get diamonds but you dont. You also have very little control over the stories because all good choices have to.be bought with diamonds. Also the amount of time it takes to refill lives is stupid.....3 hours for.2 lives! Deleting this game now,Yes
"At first, I thought this was a great way to get my 10 year old to read, but these ""chapters"" are laden with adult content that should be available for only 18. Buyer beware",Yes
"I understand that making the player's character's expression is hard. BUT if you can do 4 different hairstyles, then you can have a character the player plays as WITH A LITTLE MORE COLOR. As a poc it's a bit discomforting choose between white girl with blonde hair versus brunette hair as my main character.Not only that but as a brand new player in order to get the first premium options (white girls with ""fancy"" hair) you need 17 diamonds each. When starting 1 story the very first option you have is choosing the looks of your players. You earn diamonds by completing chapters (1 per complete chapter). So if i wanted to have white girl with ""fancy"" hair, I will have had to complete 17 chapters. But the about if tickets given to new players is 5. (Tickets are used to unlock story chapters 1 ticket per chapter.) So these Premium options are ENTIRELY USELESS UNLESS YOU STRAIGHT IF THE BACK BY DIAMONDS. There should be a starter amount of diamonds or some other way to EARN THEM without taking a thousand years. Or have the initial premium items more diamond affordable.That way the player can pick and choose what options they can want to plurge on. For example, I am more interested in the back story than just cursing my boss out so buying the premium backstory then would enrich my game experience and I'd just save my diamonds by not choosing the option of cursing by boss out. I as a player would like the choice.Instead of having a learning curve there should definitely be a tutorial story that explains how diamonds a slow to come by if EARNED and how the whole ticket situation works.",Yes
"It's a fun distraction. Predictable, but it's fun that you get to be a part of the story.",Yes
I love the set up of the game. The story plots are amazing i can't put it down. It feels like a good book that I control the main character.,Yes
I really enjoy this with the unpredictable nature of the stories,Yes
I deleted it with in the first 2 min. because it was so lagy. When I was reading the reviews I thought it was some hug geting payed to put bad reviews but it is real bad.,Yes
"I thought this game would be horrible,but then got it it became the best mobile game in the world to me.",Yes
"Though I enjoyed playing the game, it became way too expensive to continue playing...This is a game designed for those that like to bully others. If you spend money you can advance to levels that make others cower in fear from your presence...  But, if you can't afford to be that all powerful bully, the makers of this game dangle safety options  (like shields) that remain intact allowing you to safely build your resources and military... or so you think...  They give the bullies an option that literally gives them free access to your resources and makes your shields completely worthless...  Basically robbing you of hundreds (or thousands) of real dollars.This game is the worse type of game for honest hardworking folks, but it will cost you real serious money to even stay in the game.",Yes
"Great game but loses one star for being overpriced. The packages are full and in themselves may be a good value but smaller transactions should be available as well.  The gold store should let players buy what they need and shop and not have to buy packages with loaded with stuff they don't want or need.With that said, the game play is engaging and addicting. Battle with AI and PvP, collect resources, build up your base and army, make alliances, and craft resources into more effective and powerful tools to aid you in your conquest of the state.",Yes
The most epic game you can build an army join forces and attack and control stats it's an awesome game to play,Yes
I thought there would be more action,Yes
Battles.......you just sit and for the out come. I like action.,Yes
So in this game you need to be rich. Well barely anyone rich so it pretty much sucks. Plus the graphic suck and you don't even see the battle. I thought it would be fun but it's horrible. Don't even get this game.,Yes
"I wish we could give negative stars. Frustrating frustrating frustrating, did I mention frustrating, zero customer service.Pros:Could be fun if it worked right and you got your money 's worthCons:1. The game never works right. Also if you think you are playing for free, forget about it, this game is not fun at all unless you spend money, otherwise you are constantly losing battles. Been there tried that, not fun at all.2. 80% of the time you don't get what you paid for. Example, you buy a pack that is $99 and comes with few different types of of upgrade, lets call them A, B and C. So you paid $99 to get upgrade A, upgrade B, Upgrade C. Fantastic you are all happy now to use the upgrade and make your moves, 1 problem, for some reason when you go to apply upgrade C, you get an error. Ok contact customer service right? Read #33. Contacting customer service = you send an email for help, you immediately get a programed response saying their team is viewing your claim, then you wait 24 to 48 hours for response. When they do respond it is always the same:A. If your issues is the game giving you an error or something not working right, then you are told ""programmers are aware and are working on it. (sure, I have been waiting for over a year for the programmers to fix my errors and nothing, meanwhile they have my money for the issue that is not working)B. If your issue is you didn't get the correct amount of something then they will keep incorrectly telling you that you are the one that is mistaken and you did get the correct amount,  even tho after the first 3 times you have learned your lesson and this time you have screen shots as proof.(see my first picture about credits, at the bottom you see link for 6 screnshots as proof, still didn't get my 3 million  credits till this day, now it is obsolete)4. One email per day. After waiting 24 to 48 hours (mostly 48 or longer) you get a response back from  customer service if you are lucky, and you respond, you now have to wait 24 hours for a response, in short your communication is limited to one email per day making every issue a week long project.5. Don't expect them to read your emails, example last week I like an idiot decided to come back to this game, paid for upgrade pack, part of it was something called ""instant multiple research"". What this does is allows you to upgrade bunch of categories with one click instead of literally 100s of clicks. Emailed customer service complaining about ""instant multiple research"" not working, 2 days later got a response saying we understand you have an issue with ""alliance gifts"" we are working on it. Now ""alliance gifts"" have nothing to do with ""instant multiple research"" so obviously they didn't read my email at all.That is like you call AT&T to complain about your ""cellphone service"" and they say: we understand you are having an issue with your"" tivo box"" and we are working on it.That was last week, replied to them saying their response had nothing to do with my issue, you want to know what their response is?I will let you know when they respond because 7 days and 5 emails later, I have 0 response to report to you. This is Machine Zone's idea of customer service.6. No way to contact this company other than the process above, which basically means no way of contacting this company. Mobile Strike, gods of War and a couple of other games are owned by machine zone.STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME / COMPANY, THEIR FINE PRINT SAYS YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS AND THEY ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO HAVE THE GAME WORKING PROPERLY OR OWE YOU ANYTHING AT ALL WHETHER ITS THE GAME WORKING  CORRECTLY, YOU GETTING WHAT YOU PAID FOR IN-APP PURCHASES. CUSTOMER SATISFACTION MEANS ZERO TO THIS COMPANY, I WARNED YOU.LOOK AT ALL THE OTHER NEGATIVE REVIEWS HERE AND EVERY PLACE ELSE, ALSO GOOGLE ""MOBILE STRIKE COMPLAINT"".",Yes
"First and foremost, this game is absolutely a ""money-suck"". Most of the reviews stating this are true 100%. However, you CAN safely enjoy this game and play for challenges without spending too much money. Now how much is that? I would say under $200. Again, that is still A LOT of money to drop on a mobile app game and there are certainly better games out there that you can play for much less. But as long as you can get into a new state, power up rather quickly, and join a leading alliance, there will be alliance gifts from other spenders that will provide the necessary gold to remain shielded most of the time. If you pick your packs right, that gold will last you a long time. Have fun!",Yes
Needs more action without purchasing coins,Yes
"First off this is not a game you can play once or twice a week and expect to do well in. This game is actually very good. Don't be scared off by those saying this is pay to play. Sure there are those that spend big and unless you want to spend big you won't compete with them. However, if you get in a great alliance, complete challenges and actually put time and effort into the game  you can compete with most players. There are ways to protect your troops and resources so you don't have to worry about starting from scratch. Stay on top of it and you will prosper. This saying this is pay to play just don't want to have to actually work at a game and expect to be the best right away.",Yes
This is Game of War with a different skin but with the same ridiculous challenges and purchase expectations by the developers.  This game is free to download but not to play as you will find that in order to even enjoy a slight competition you will have to spend money and lots of it.,Yes
"Mobile Strike could be a fun and addicting game, if the developers had placed game play ahead of profiteering.  Before you can get emotionally hooked into the ""story line"" (if there is one), and real action, you are confronted too soon with having to make purchases.  You can decide to play the game for 30 seconds per day, which does not build game loyalty or desire to come back and play, or you can spend money.It really becomes a choice. Which games will you choose to invest in.  I did not choose this one.  I have my games that I invest in. this one does not give me reason to switch.Will it give you enough reason?  I don't know.  I don't think the developers give you enough time to figure that out.",Yes
"This is actually a very fun game, you make friends, work together, learn new game related things together, compete, etc.  HOWEVER, it is a cash cow.  Lately, it has become a super cash cow.  Mobile Strike and EW are offering new things, items, researches, challenges, gear, sales (yes thats what they are called) but even if you buy, you are not given ample time to use, learn to use, or even try out, before they come up with something else.  Losing all desire to play, as they are making sure it's no longer fun for those of us who have played it for a while.Just an observation, as the more experienced players are maxed, close to maxing out, MS and EW guess, getting rid of them or making them bored with non gaming things, the newer players will want to spend more.Good thing I have grown, have bought,and have played at my leisure.  May just be time to play Candy Land.",Yes
too much tech...not enough action.  The app. is presented as an action game like it can be played like the pc games.  Nothing is further from the truth.  The game stinks. Thumbs down.  Save time and money...,Yes
"In my opinion, I have wasted money on this game. I have had burning in my base because reboots, or game glitches, at times of battle where I am attacking and getting attacked then the game resets/ or reboots. Leaving my base venerable to further attacks and no way to control or limit this problem. You can't shield, or change to defensive gear when you aren't connected. Then you contact customer support and their generic response is:our team is working on these issues, we should have a resolution soon.OK, so what does that fix for me, HERE AND NOW? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING....",Yes
"I wish I had never started the game, play for free my ass. The site is full of problems. constant connectivity issues, lags and getting kicked offline and attacked and not being able to defend. A class action law suit should be started to help refund the money that MZ has stolen from its player. Nice job MZ, you ruined the game,.your software.developer's suck ass.",Yes
No challenge to the player. Just press where the arrow points!,Yes
Didn't play as much as I wanted.I found it addictive and a ChallengeMy kind of game!,Yes
Not enough action,Yes
Not as much action as I thought,Yes
"About 14 months ago this was a fun game.  It has a challenge.  U had to make your gear and combine items.  Now it's buy everything.  But don't work what u buy today will be out of date tomorrow.Even if u ""load"" your packs so they are cheaper it's still expensive to play.  So if u just starting out, quit the game now.",Yes
"I am writing this review so that others can make see what my experience with the game was and then make their own decision. I downloaded this to get a ""reward"" from another game that I played. I was hooked in the first day and saw that the max base or headquarters level was level 30 in June of 2017. It is now October and the max HQ level is 250 if I recall correctly.I want to be the best and be able to conquer the game so I made my first purchase, I was promised an HQ level of ""X"", a commander level of ""X"", and completed research levels of ""X"". After my purchase I was not able to complete the items as stated in the ""sale"". I contacted the developer and after 10 emails I was able to straighten out my issue.This cycle continued until I stopped playing in August of 2017. What I found was that once I made it to a certain point, that for another mere $100 I could level up to another point and so on. I found that it is a never ending cycle.I spent a huge chunk of money on the game and found that, if you did not purchase the newest package your base, troops, research, etc. was obsolete. The newer base, troops, research, etc. always ""destroyed"" the last package release.When I started playing the items were consistent and everyone was ""maxed"" out. Epic war, LLC. is releasing new items every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturdays currently. If you are NOT buying the latest and greatest you cannot ""safely"" accomplish the goals of the game which are to destroy other bases and hold control points.They (EW) come out with a √¢??new√¢?¬ù sale every few days that always state guaranteed √¢??max√¢?¬ù. If it was Guaranteed √¢??max√¢?¬ù then it should √¢??stop√¢?¬ù at that point and not continue to increase. The HQ was a max of 30, then 40, then 100, then 200, now 250. The commander, VIP, troops, research, each have levels as well. While one package may ""max"" out say your commander, you need another once to max out your VIP, or HQ, etc.The game depreciates faster than buying a new car, for example when they release something on Tuesday, it comes with say 100 items for $100 and you need 1,000 of those items to ""max"" out your base. Then when the new items come Thursday (or sometimes they come Tuesday night or Wednesday morning) they include the 1,000 items for $20-$80. Keep in mind that even though it includes the full 1,000 items for what you needed on Tuesday, it now needs 1,000 different items for another ""upgrade"" but it only comes with 100 of those items.There are constant glitches in the game that don√¢??t allow the game to play properly. Also you are constantly missing items after the √¢??purchase√¢?¬ù. It generally takes three or more emails to the developer before they attempt to fix the issue. It takes another three to four emails after that before you have the items completed.The numbering and amount of items required went from you need 1,000 of this, to you need 1TT (TT= Septillion, yes it's a real number) of that same item to ""level"" it up. Currently (10-16-17) there are people with a power level of 1KTTT (Sedecillion), which require you to have an unreal amount of troops.If you choose to spend money on this game do some research, there are many ways to save money when buying packs, but as I said you need an Unlimited disposable income stream to play this game.I am happy to spend √¢??some√¢?¬ù money to play a game that I can enjoy and I would be happy to also pay to see the game progress, however when the game progresses three times a week it is theft and a scam.Good luck to you.",Yes
To much like a sims format. No real adventure.,Yes
"The great heyday of mmorpg in mobile OS was '08 - '13. That does not mean those games aren't around anymore but new offers & participation have been stagnant in the last few years after a massive contraction. - That said, you'll like this game if you are into mmorpg and you won't be deceived by the ads with Arnold. It is one of the best games of its kind out there at the moment. Word of caution though: Success will only follow IF you will join one of the leading alliances with a high gift level (above 15) AND you are prepared to spend some $$ eventually ($5 - $100). After four months you will reach lvl 21 (of 30) and game play will become expensive because you will have to buy packages a lot more often. From the makers of Engine Age's ""Game Of War - Fire Age"", this one runs on the same engine and the devs (EW called here) are experienced and they've learned their lessons from other failed mmorpg type games; glitches are kept mostly under control and cheating (i.e. through script hacking) is not allowed. Devs have recently disallowed play on older devices with OS from before '15. They actually DO enforce their TOS. - Expect to put in anywhere between 15 minutes to upwards of an hour per day and account. Happy gaming.",Yes
Although the graphics are great for a kindle fire and the game gets updated almost every day is great but every thing else is bad here are a few reasons why.1. The game get boring after a while.2. There is no animations of your units fighting the enemy which turns down your excitement of taking down an enemy.3. This game is so terrible that almost all the bases around you are abandoned YES I said it there are a lot of abandoned bases which obviously mean that the game is bad.4. Some of the guilds in this game are not even active anymore I went In to a guild and I wasn't for a month and I came back and the boss didn't kick me out so I mail him to say hi and he didn't respond which means it's completely abandoned.5. Yes there are bullies in this game so watch out for them.Should you get the game? Absolutely noHere are my reasons why this game is bad I mean shoot even Invasion: New frontier is better even though the developers stop updating it. And obviously the game is just a rip off of Game of War don't get the game it's just not fun. I rate 2 stars for graphics and updates.,Yes
Not my kind of game action...guess I'll stick with Xbox.....,Yes
Nonstop action packed thriller,Yes
For a game that has been on the market as long as this it is absolutely pathetic that it has significant stability issues. It crashes constantly on multiple Android devices. Completely unacceptable. Between the horrible stability and the fact that you literally have to spend hundreds-thousands of dollars to not be a doormat the game is a complete waste.  Don't bother.,Yes
Put parental controls on after I saw this downloaded,Yes
"EVERY review i have read is spot on! This game is a giant scheme meant to bleed you dry of your hard earned money.Make no mistake. They care not about you,  your game experience or anything of the sort. Full of glitches, terrible lag that makes competing impossible and excruciatingly frustrating.You're a small fish if you spend even as much as 500 American Dollars per week. The customer service or lack thereof is absolute horse excrement! CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT IS RIGHT!To whomevers' Lawgroup decides to actually take this to the courtroom. BRAVO, and thank you!  I hope you take them the the cleaners like they have been taking us for the last 3 years or so.We are ALL ready to join the list to take these scumbags to court and put OUR cash back where it rightfully belongs. DO NOT. I REPEAT, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME",Yes
"Strangely addicting. This game combines the growing of a sim-like-city with the action of armies fighting. Join an alliance (you almost have to if you have any hope of realistically growing) and have fun with them. I would say, keep searching for an alliance until you find an alliance that is beneficial to you and your base so you can have fun and grow at the same time.I spend hours a day playing and building up my base and army so I can attack others while I watch Tv or just relax.There are alliances that have spent HUGE amounts of money to upgrade their Headquarters and armies that have an enormous edge on just about everyone not spending hundreds of dollars (if not thousands of dollars). I have my bases in HIMO (#200) and the PurG alliance pretty much does whatever they want, and I believe that other states are the same way (containing aggravating bases with deep pockets that rain havoc on the little guys). I've known a few players quit playing altogether after playing for a few months and getting attacked repeatedly by extremely larger bases and because there is really no recourse whatsoever (without spending hundred or thousands of dollars). This is the extreme suck of the game, but what do you expect, those bases have invested A LOT of money in the game while I have spent very little so they get to do what they want and I have to adapt.I know it sounds pretty bad, but there are a lot of good people playing to make the game really fun and getting attacked is just part of a war game. I would strongly suggest you purchase at least a $4.99 package and a $19.99 package with good gear so you can progress much faster. My 2nd base is approaching the power of my first base because of only those two purchases.",Yes
Perfect for action.battle there battle that battle when,Yes
"other reviews right on. it's a money grab and you cannot compete or play without paying thousands. the game is not an action game. they simply ask you for a hundred bucks every time you log on to complete endless research which becomes obsolete within a week..the commercials are right, it is addictive in a bad way  because you think you are making progress in this scam but you can't. also you can lose the money you just spent instantly by getting destroyed by bigger bases...makes it gambling, not gaming.",Yes
This game has a very steep learning curve. Prepare to devote a great deal of time with this one. A great game for those who like a stiff challenge. Ads are very misleading.,Yes
Fun Game great global interactions but it cost way to much to keep up,Yes
This game will not let me battle and I thought it was fun for once. I got this to get my stress out when I'm mad but does not help me at all√∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???. So if you want to get a game that will not let you fight this is the game good lucky gamers and don't truss the front covers the rate and the pictures.,Yes
"not what I thought it would be. Arnold, you lied!",Yes
"Heres Another One Ive Not Played I Thought It would Be good For My Grandsons But Theyre to Young So Am Removing it Also Thank You susan Boyd,",Yes
"This game was obtained for my grandson, so this review is basically made through his feedback.  He is seven.  Overall, he puts this game in the middle ranks of his gaming interest.  It is probably a bit too advanced for him as it is really a strategy game on civilization building and military action.  It is probably more suited to kids in the 8-12 age group.He tells me it is fun, and after watching him play it for a couple of hours, he was well (and quietly) entertained.  Be warned that it is basically a game of nation building, but it has a lot of violence embedded in the results of that nation building.",Yes
"The interface is slow, cluttered and confusing.  The map is un-navigable.  The ""chat"" feature is tied to the gold store, but there is only a crude ability to communicate with other players.  The ""blog"" is a succession of blurbs regarding the latest sale bundle.  Although masquerading as a ""war game"" there is nothing of strategy or tactics - which required C3 (communication, command & control).Also, the game is not playable without spending a LOT of money.  $99.99 purchases are required to unlock key buildings, technologies and fighting capabilities.My advice - don't bother.",Yes
"i thought it was a shooting game, haven't shoot anything. Upgrade this, upgrade that, would you like to buy something....they call me general,I'd rather be a grunt.",Yes
"Crap- designed not to be a game, but to reach into your pocket. Made me feel as thought they had all the moves planned and there was nothing really for me to do.",Yes
"Fun to play, very addictive, but very very very expensive...$100 packs have great content but they shouldn't cost $100, they need to work on making it more affordable for more people to play and keep the action going!  Otherwise, there will be only a few big players and everyone else will fall off and delete the app.",Yes
It's a like clash of clans but more realistic and the graphics suck its boring for me I like a action packed games,Yes
I've played this game for years now and with the change in ownership It has got out of control.  The new owners changed the rules of the game and made it much more expensive to play and win in the game.  They over payed for m.s. and expect the players to pay for them buying mobile Strike from epic.  Don't play this game because with the social aspect is very addicting.,Yes
enjoy the challenge,Yes
"Game is very slow when selecting actions, very slow to respond to the selections made.",Yes
My son downloaded this without permission.  The parental controls feature on the Kindle needs to be updated!,Yes
this is a great opportunity for anyone who wants action,Yes
Pay to Win garbage. Avoid.Also don't be surprised if knowing this- and still choosing to play AND pay- that you wind up not getting what you payed for and the company refusing to make it right.,Yes
Good graphics and action.,Yes
Thought it was free Didn't know Id have to pat to play it right',Yes
"Great game but developers are greedy - choosing money over player's enjoyment of the game.  In order to be competitive,  you will have to spend thousands of dollars a month.  New elements come out every week that cost hundreds of dollars,  only to be replaced and made obsolete 2 weeks later.",Yes
Great game. A lot of action.,Yes
"This game can be fun, and has a lot of potential, but is something of a bait and switch.  The first game pack can be purchased for only 4.99, and the next is 19.99...still not too unreasonable...but every one thereafter is a whopping 99.99. Considering how glitchy the software is, and always at the worst possible time, it's definitely not worth it unless you're independently wealthy. There is simply no way to effectively compete unless you're shelling out lots of money.  Game rules and explanations are rudimentary at best, and while there have been obvious attempts to make the game interface as intuitive as possible, it still has a very long way to go. All of this makes for a considerable amount of confusion for new players.  Customer support has generally been timely, but helpful or useful only about half the time. Whether you receive a support agent with a solid working knowledge of the game seems strictly up to chance.  Overall, for the exhorbitant prices being charged, this game needs to work much, much better. A real pity, because it does have some interesting ideas behind it. It's a crying shame they don't simply lower their prices, and try to make up for the difference by doing volume business instead. It would certainly leave far fewer players feeling as though they've been cheated.",Yes
"Did not care for this game because too many actual cash charges required to complete task.  I uninstalled it.  For one that cares to continue shelling out cash it would be a nice action packed game, but not for me.",Yes
Started playing this game almost 3 years ago and it was fun especially when you where in an alliance with others because you actually got to know each other as best you when chatting with someone. You would get help from others and try to build but it was always whoever spent the most was the most powerful and out of your league. Yet there was still fun and strategy involved. I would've given it 5 stars about 2 years ago. However about a year ago or more it got to where if you wasn't spending money every week you couldn't even play the game in all honesty unless you wanted to loose everything you played the game to build. Now everything is obsolete like tile collecting and building your own gear. Trying to keep up with everything new that comes out every 3 days or week at most cost you a small fortune and make you study to keep up with what's going on. So even if you do spend money by the end of the week what you spent it to get is now useless and outdated. The game is now ruined and I know many loyal players who finally called it quits. They absolutely ruined this game by wanting to make more and more money. I get the games purpose is for the people who run the app is to make money but not ruin the game in the process. Like another review said do yourself a favor and play something similar where you don't have to spend a small fortune every week unless your rich. However like I said even if you want to do that good luck understanding every new thing each week.,Yes
This is a fun game but it keeps wanting you to buy a crate of gold in order to claim some of the prizes you get for completing the challenges. I still don't understand that game very well but I will learn it.,Yes
not a real war game all MS is how much can u spend  the more u spend the better MS likes u . things get ripped off by MS and the tech support blames the player and never takes responsibility for its mistakes unless benefits MS  also its rigged for who MS wants to win at the challenges,Yes
I think this game is amazing I played GoW and liked it I see this game and see that it has the same reviews so i downloaded it all you people who give this bad reviews are inconsiderate impatient people with no self control as I said this game is amazing,Yes
"I regret ever spending $ on this game. It just keeps getting worst. Constant glitches. All they care about is making new packs and false advertisement.  Now they are advertising ""medals"". U buy for over $70 . But they dont tell u these medals, are only effective for 1.5 hrs, then u basically have to buy another pack to get them again.. plz.... stay away from this game.  Hopefully they have a major class action lawsuit against them SOON!!!!",Yes
This game is dumb I thought it would be like clash of clan or something,Yes
"This game is great. Lots of people to meet, alliances to form and action.  However saying that, it is an expensive game to play.  There is no free playing, or even trying to get by with buying smaller packs. You have to spend big to stay competitive. Trust me I have spent thousands on this game and I know many people who have ruined their lives spending all their money on this game. One friend was warned multiple times by his wife and ended up getting divorce papers.  Another spent all his money and could not pay his bills. Long story short he was depressed and drank and drove.. got a DUI, lost his job...was evicted. You will never sell your account for what it is worth or even close. Once you spend that money it is gone and you need to make sure you have the kind of income where you can afford this.  People in my alliance spend $500 a week on packs as there is always new research, troops and building coming out.You need to really make sure you can afford to play this game b4 you download it. Think of it as legal online gambling. The kind where if you forget your shield is coming down and you are zeroed.. all the $$$ you have spent on your base and troops will be erased.  Many people play this game for a month or two invest a couple hundred dollars...are zeroed forgetting about their shield and then quit and are never seen again. There are other games where you can literally get by spending little to no money.... but that is not Mobile StrikeThis game is addicting, please respect my warning.",Yes
I thought this was a shooting game.  It sucks. No *,Yes
Slow moving...not enough action!,Yes
"It's definitely not for everyone. If you want graphics and animation look elsewhere. What this game does provide is real strategy, base building, diplomacy on a massive scale, and social interaction. Its an alliance based game, so if you plan on playing know you have to play in a team. If you're very competitive, just be warned, you'll need to spend money. You can play without money, but you won't be very influential.Other then that expect layers upon layers of game play that intertwine into a masterpiece of a game (coming for a decades old gamer). This isn't your Clash of Clans or Dominations type of game. You wont get pretty battles or see things blowing up, its a numbers game, and its played mainly by adults. The community is mature, smart, and helpful for the most part.If you are a GOW player, its a chance to start anew, as its the exact same game reskinned in the modern era.",Yes
"I thought it would be different than it was. My whole army disappeared during an attack and it said that I had troops deployed. They were no where to be found and I had zero casualties. So, it was the glitches more than anything else. The game play on the commercials make it look different than it is.",Yes
Not as good as I thought.,Yes
"Thought this game would be great, glad it was free though, I deleted it because of the lag. Also crashed. This game was no fun",Yes
Not what I thought it was going to be it's all tap this read this tap that read that tap this again an again,Yes
Doesn't make any since. How do you use the controls? Really stupid! Waste of time.,Yes
"Mobile Strike is similar to other games out there, you have to build and survive.  The action is not as fantastic as the ads would have you believe.  This is a strategy game not mmrp.",Yes
To much work to set it up.  I thought it would be more intuitive but seems like a time hog.,Yes
"This game is a money pit preying on those that don't have the time to ""nurture"" their base and spend at least $200.00 a week to keep up with the bullies. They even have interview type communications to determine if you are good enough to be in the ""group"". Psychologically, it brings out an ugly type of competiveness for those who love to control. ..Kind of like the Napoleon Syndrome. One of the goals is to attack a base 100 times. The sneaky attacker will teleport to their victim. attack... then take off again.  It is almost impossible to get higher then a base of 25 and to try to defend your base is impossible unless you use your peace shields.",Yes
"smooth action, very impressive scenarios, can become addictive.",Yes
I find it confusing and a bit boring. I thought there would be more action. I'm going to give it a bit longer but I might end up deleting it,Yes
I will make this very straightforwardPros-Good graphicsBig state battlesLittery 65 million people play itNot a pay to win (unless you are very inpatient)There are so many people playing it your alliance will have 100 players in no timeIf you make a account you can get 5-10$ worth of gold in a dayCons-For me it shuts down every 5-15 minsHints-Invest a lot in skill points and research for building you can get a whopping 60% cut off of time for building if your skills and research are fully upgradedAlso loot as many resource tiles as possible resources. WILL become scarce after a whileAll ways work in making your defence higher if so you probably won't be attacked unless you are in a highly populated high rank sectionIf you spawn in kald join the (try1) Bombarders today!Includes a fully awesome action packed Billy action figure like this one below! -√∞??¬†-doesn't exist in real life/|\/\,Yes
I thought it was just going to be a bad game then it was amazing!!!!!,Yes
Right now still pretty new so still working on things such as max out at lv10 on V.I.P and waiting for opening of prestige. People are already getting strong from spending cash on game. Can still be competitive but see it becoming like game of war in which billions of power and burn everyone. If don't spend hundreds of dollars in GOW it's not worth playing but this game is at beginning and growing. It is very addicting so now i play Mobile Strike instead of GOW but they are very similar. Hope to be able to enjoy this game for a while but fear big wallets have potential to ruin this game like it did in GOW.,Yes
"Another great challenge. But, you must pay close attention all around you. I don't know which I like the best, this one or Sniper shooting.",Yes
"I used to like this piece of trash of a game, But now I have realized how much of a Boring, Addicting, Money Grab of a game this is. Absolutely no action in this game at all. Upon first trying out the game, you will become addicted to the point where its like smoking. You won't be able to stop spending money as you constantly try to stay powerful. You will waste so much money on Overpriced Gold Purchases and end up losing so much money, just to get destroyed by someone who has spent more money than you. So please, heed my warning. If you want a boring game that you will spend 500$ on, then go ahead. I DARE you to delete this game after being at HQ Level 10. You won't be able to do it. Its too addicting. Luckily, I am an Experienced Gamer who has played these types of games in the past. I was able to quit before they sucked up all of my cash. Please, just listen. You've been Warned.",Yes
Not what I thought it was.,Yes
I thought it would be fun but the second time I played it it would not let me play,Yes
"No fun, feels like a job keeping up on all the actions and building.",Yes
Fun action not the best hoarders,Yes
"Exactly the same as Game of War, but without mythical creatures.Could use more interesting landscape, and more uniqueness in features. When I played it I thought I had accidentally opened GOW.",Yes
"For those of us insane enough to actually spend money on this fun yet clearly JOKE of a game I won't be spending another penny. The servers are never properly maintained and the app has horrendous lag, crashes, and now failure to do simple things such as use a shield. But het those servers are maintained just enough to cram another pack down your throat. THE HILARITY IS THE PACKS CALLED PLAYER APPRECIATION THANK YOU PACK!!!!",Yes
"You can't go forward with this game without spending a ton of money. You just get wiped out by other players who obviously have more cash than brains. That or their parents do. First, $5 then $20 and then they hit you with the $100 package. It's a good concept but no action so it gets dull real fast if you're not willing to dump at least $125 into it. The constant notifications get old quick. Those teenagers that stay up all night attack while you're sleeping because you actually have a job or a life. Don't waste your hard earned cash on this. Take your significant other out instead.",Yes
"This is a very attention keeping game.  Is way better than I thought it would be. It's faster moving than gamwe similar to Mobil Strike. You can eawhat you need to win wars - very hands on. Easy to learn and very fun to play!  If you want to spend money in app, they are very reasonable.",Yes
"The people you meet in the game are great and the game used to be fun. ""Sales"" or ""Player's appreciation"" are always going on with some contents that are useless or expensive. New items show up often and game glitches often. I like the weekend wars.",Yes
Great game good interaction but to many offers and not the ones I want same thing over and over,Yes
It is a good game idea but it is not like the adds at all. I thought you would at least be able look at the battle when they happen but all you see is fire appear on the base you attack. When i first got in the game i thought &#34;this is pretty glichy but so far fun.&#34; And so I just thought that maybe it is just temporary but it isn't. The first time I got in it it shut down then the more played it it kept doing it until I couldn't get InTo it at all. So very glichy and boring the only reason I gave it three not one because I thought it was a good idea,Yes
"This &#34;game&#34; is a discouraging waste of time. After 3 months of constant grinding I think that it is fair to present this review. Having read multiple reviews from other players I know that my experience is not unique but very common. Each state is governed by the players that cheat the most and spend the most money. The only way to succeed is to spend more money than the other players, or hack the game for items that would cost money. The culminating purpose of the game is to have each state work together to beat out other states in point challenges. However the petty power bullies refuse to allow any smaller players the opportunity to fully engage in the challenges by utterly destroying their base. Wish I never downloaded it. Glad I never spent money on it. Oh, yeah! The big power players try to muscle and intimidate other players into spending money to pay them for protection, like the Mafia. And customer service actually ENDORSES THIS BEHAVIOR!",Yes
Ok so when I saw this game in the adds I thought It was going to be fun but apparently not the game itself is fun but how do I progress when the game runs at lagg all the time so I can't even movie and froze my entire tablet and I had to restart my tablet can make the game less laggier then I'll rate five stars(by the wayi own a kindle fire hd ),Yes
"6 months ago I thought it might be possible to play this game in some meaningful way without breaking the bank, but it isn't possible. New updates, gear, research trees, mods, insignia every other day and to obtain them you are going to have to drop at least $99 per pack, and the pack isn't going to contain all that you need, so you're going to need to buy multiple packs. I never thought I would be a top base, but thought I could at least have some fun but the updates have made the concept of a trap base almost impossible and there is word that they are beta testing even more new shield busters to guarantee that lower spending trap bases can play too.On top of the ridiculous costs to be able to unshield and have some fun, this game is seriously flawed. Tons of glitches, pathetic graphics and it crashes all of the time. And, naturally, when they advertise a deal that they later decide was too good and people spend real money and in game currency to attain it, they cancel it without warning and blame one of their ""glitches"" on it. Aside from shady bait and switches, this company also engages in outright false advertising. I have repeatedly seen packs with the title, ""Get More Blueprints!"" that contained zero blueprints, and because of this I have friends who repeatedly bought packs and did not get the level 23 blueprint that you can only buy in packs but is required to level your base past level 22 (current max base level is 30). If you don't plan on spending thousands of dollars, don't play this game. And if you do plan on spending thousands of dollars, you can probably find a much higher quality game that isn't just an over glorified chat room.",Yes
"Doing research, understanding mods and gear sets, and buying some ""packs"" will make you a big dog.. Amazon coins offer a discounted way to purchase these packs with sometimes only obtainable items that help you fly high..",Yes
"Pretty lame.  Crashes, no challenges.  Just one non-adventure after another.",Yes
"i played this game and all you do is upgrade buildings, the ad looked so cool so i thought id try it, but i couldnt go to war you had to wait for somebody to attack. long story short i got tired of waiting and ended up uninstalling.",Yes
"I'm not a game person, but I thought that it could be fun. I thought different about one minute after it downloaded. This isn't a game, it's a lifestyle. You have to build the infrastructure of the base, make alliances to get material all while reading a directory of rules and regs. I already did my service time, I don't need to reenlist. Screw this.....",Yes
"I just reinstalled this game to write this review and I will remove it when I finish.I got Mobil Strike as a easy enjoyable game which I appraoaced as a non cash player. So, I made lvl 14 and was going to keep playing but the game has become really unstable. It crashes after one or two actions. Can't find the app store or just goes away. Not relaxing, not for me any more....gone.",Yes
"terrible cheats, first i waisted $600 for absolutly nothing.  i even pushed so many buttons the phone broke, or that was because of their overloads of advertising; either way, games fault for sure, it will drain your battery in 1/2 hour. even brand new iphone 8!  Then within 6months they threw everything out with no compensation! and then had the nerve to try and get you to start over.  I dont see how that was legal√Ç¬ø  dont touch this scam,  because they have already started over 3 times.  causing players to waist $100's of dollars. the only people on the game are such bullies!  makes you wonder how much of the game they are controlling.  it's a hole of nightmare, you just can't win no matter how much you spend or how accomplished your base is set up.",Yes
"This game is a scam.  I thoroughly enjoyed it in the beginning, but now this is not the product I have been funding at all.  They are placing far too much product in at one time, the game is entirely unbalanced, and before you think that perhaps this is just a rant of an individual that is tired of paying to play, even that functionality does not work properly.  The packs you purchase either via Google, Amazon, or iTunes do not go through half the time making it time out on the challenges, then not to mention the items you receive are pretty much pointless as the coding in this game is so entirely in disarray that the number does not even line up with your attacks.  This game is completely broken now, and I will not be playing, paying, or continuing with any of this nonsense any longer.  Seeking refund as I state prior this is not the game that we all began to play, and now it is a broken mess being allowed to be downloaded by the afore mention providers.",Yes
"Mobile Strike is a poor excuse for a game.  Epic, has clearly established a platform that has enabled a classic scam to satisfy greed. The game is extreamly frustrating. I played this game when it first started and enjoyed it for a couple of months. When I quit the first time I had just completed level 21 and within a few days they came out with level 22.  There is a constant push to spend money to keep your forces at a level to be effective.  Most packs cost $99.  After a year I came back and there now is level 60's. epic offered a catch up pack for $4.99. Not bad I thought. The next pack was $19.00 to bring me to a level 90.  Within 3 weeks they are offering level 125's. the numbers used to track resources are astronomical.  Numbers like Million - Trillion- Trillion- Trillion (MTTT).  Epic constantly is modifying the game, ever increasing the need to purchase new packs to achieve the next level. Once a level is extended they are increasing the newest power levels by factors of 10. By doing that a person with a lower power level does not stand a chance fighting an opponent that is 10 times stronger.  So, the $4.99 catch up offer rapidly turned into $99 packs to keep up.  The current version of the game requires two power steps a week to remain competitive.  I would highly recommend to stay away from this so called game.",Yes
"Graphics and challenges are really good. The game is really complicated and not for younger kids at all. There is a very difficult technique to mastering the game as you rely on buildings, gear and mods that are all based on percentages and numbers. If you join a good alliance, you will learn easily what to do and start rally wars together which is a blast. My biggest complaint however and why I gave it 1 star is this. They claim in all their adds that the game is free. Which could be true except it would take you several years to build your base and gear to even remotely be able to compete in the game. Also, there are a lot of things, including gear that you absolutely can not get without spending money. If you do not spend money then you will not enjoy this game. You can't compete and you spend your entire time farming tiles (which you get attacked on) and you still won't be able to gather enough rss to complete required research, build buildings and train troops.And let's not forget the packs they offer you to buy start at $9.99 just for gold (which gets you nothing) and up to $150 packs which get you a lot. However, the more you progress, it could take upwards of 16-20 packs to complete one research tree. That's $1600-2000 dollars using the average $99 packs they offer. Total rip off for digital info they upload after your purchase. ALSO, You purchase these expensive packs and you don't receive all the items, or they disappear from your inventory when your not looking.  I caution you to not get this game as it is addicting and you will rack up credit card bills before you know it. I know a lot of people that played this game that lost control and went into serious debt. RIP OFF",Yes
"What can I say to prevent you all much pain?  I have NEVER experienced such abuse of customers/players on any game I've ever played.  In truth, I still play, but not for much longer and only because I've invested over $1,500 in this already.  That's right, and it's not an exaggeration.  If you don't want to spend money, you'll get crushed the first time you forget to shield.  If you do spend money, you'll quickly find out that IT IS NEVER ENOUGH!  Mobile Strike comes up with some new ""gotta have"" research, defense or attack mode almost weekly.  So you thought buying those two or three $99.99 packs was going to catch you up?  Not a chance.  Next week, a 450,000% boost is offered.  The monsters of the game (my acct is huge, but I don't qualify as a monster, even being in $1,500) will eat you alive.  I have friends that are in this game over $5,000, and they are struggling to keep up.  My entire game state is talking about quitting.  Mobile Strike's response to numerous requests to at least slow down with the new packs/gadgets...  ""Then just don't play anymore.""  That's right.  Absolutely ZERO concern for their players.Look, I've played other MMO's and usually enjoy them.  Forget about free.  None of them are.  But Mobile Strike takes it to a whole new level.  Think Wall Street bankers are greedy and corrupt?  Give this game a try.  I'll list a few of what I consider abuses to their customers...  -  No disclosure on how much research is needed for each level  -  No responsibility to customer complaints/concerns  -  No ""settle in and catch up"" period for people who do spend a lot of money  -  Outright, obvious and insatiable greed of game creators/owners  -  No forewarning of new packs coming up, so a player who just spent $300, $400 or more doesn't ever know if he/she will be competitive the  following week  -  I could go on and on, but I'll stop here.I hope you took the time to read this.  There are a lot of fun games out there.  Mobile Strike could have been one of them, but it's been ruined.  Please, save yourself a ton of aggravation and money and avoid this game.  Send a message to Mobile Strike and any other MMO out there that it's ok to make money on your game, but don't abuse people.  Thanks for reading...  - Jeff",Yes
"Don't bother even installing this game unless you intend on spending at least √Ç¬£1000 (YES ONE THOUSAND GREAT BRITISH POUNDS) immediately!That won't even get you a quarter of the way to being a top player! If you're not a top player in the 1Million power bracket then you cannot play at all! If you spend only √Ç¬£500 to build your base then expect to be zero'd (wiped out) again within a week! Everything you spent √Ç¬£500 on will be gone!If you manage to keep your shield (base protection) up for that week, the √Ç¬£500 you spent will be out of date and you will need to reinvest another √Ç¬£500 to be where you was a week ago because more items will be required to progress further!I have spent over √Ç¬£4000 (YES FOUR THOUSAND GREAT BRITISH POUNDS) into this game and I am no where near a top player (rally leader) I am only able to fill rallies!However my base and gear is out of date and to get my base upto date (yet still not a top player) I need to invest another √Ç¬£500 to remain a rally filler! If I wanted to suddenly become a rally leader, I'd need to drop another √Ç¬£6000/√Ç¬£8000 into the game at least!!Don't be the next mug to line Mobile Zone aka Epic Wars pockets!!!You have been warned!!AT THE TIME OF WRITING THIS REVIEW, ALL THE TOP PLAYERS FROM ALL THE TEAMS ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGING IN A STRIKE AGAINST THE GAME DEVELOPERS DUE TO THERE MONEY GRABBING WAYS! THE GANE IS DYING AND MANY MANY PEOPLE ARE QUITTING ENMASSE............ STAY AWAY!!",Yes
"Yes you have to spend money to get the things you really need to advance in the game.  The game is way too complex, made so by EW. The marketing department has total control of EW. None of the several performance problems ever gets fixed. After my last in-app purchase the game freezes up making is largely unplayable.  Four different ""representatives"" have replied to my email.  Still no fix.",Yes
"the game it's self is fun when/if it works, major events forget about it...you might be able to play in your state but that's hit or miss.  The game glitches and crashes constantly, you invest thousands into the game to be able to play but you can never fully execute a solo or Rally without the game crashing 2-3 times a minute.  The customer service is made up of players who work for packs and very rarely can give you more then a $1-2 value gift as a refund.The response from all tickets is ""I forwarded it onto our developers, we value your opinion"".  Never mind the $10k you waste building your base.  EW and their parent company Machine Zone are con-artists and need to be shut down, full refunds issued to all players in the last 6 months....this company skirts consumer protection laws and needs to be stopped.",Yes
"I admit this game sucks you in. If your competitive.. This game is right in your wheel house. If! You have unlimited assess to money. I've seen people literally spend 40k and more on this game. There is no limit. I stopped at $100. I forced my self to stop. I could not complete with guys that spend thousands of dollars to get super bases and soldiers and gear. And new gear comes out literally every week that cost money. More than the hundred dollars I put in. So I'm getting zeroed out by these guys. All the research and work I put in to my account. The countless I mean some times eight hours. I'd set timers to remember to do stuff or reset things. All that work wiped out by a guy that spends hundreds of more dollars than me. I got mad and said enough. I can't buy anymore 100 is my max I can't play and be comfortable than to heck with it. Look! They got the ultimate action hero batting for them of course paying him a lot for his promo.. You know some shady dealing is taking place. It's obvious the way they nickel and dime you. I'm not kidding the least bit, download  the game you'll see what I'm talking bout. Remember I said it here people are spending 40k and more and it's still not enough to beat people that spend 100k Im not pulling your leg one bit.",Yes
"Unlike Hearthstone Heroes of Warcraft, Mobile Strike is about one thing- money. Sure, it's free to download but if you want to get anywhere in the game you're going to have to pay for it and pay big. They've even changed their extreme and basic challenges inside the game from being about how well you can strategize to how much you can spend.The first sale available to you is for $5, the next, $20, next $50, $100 and on. The real shocker, once you make a purchase at any level that dollar amount sales is no longer available to you, for instance, once you buy that $5 sale you can never buy another $5 sale although you Are able to purchase a pittance of gold for each amount level. If it focused more on how to make the game interesting to its players instead of how to get in their wallets Mobile Strike would be worth recommending.",Yes
"It is a great strategy game, there are lots of areas to grow and there are always challenges to complete. However, I agree with the 1 star reviewers that if you want to be the BEST you have to spend money. Lots of it. Not even hundreds, I'm talking thousands. SO, if you go in wanting to be a top competitor, then expect that. But if your like me and just want to pass the time by building a base, working through what you can and making friends, then do that, there's definitely enough to keep you busy, but there will be areas of frustration where you'll want to unlock or do something and can't unless you spend money.So if you want to try it out, here are some tips:1. Stay shielded and build your base. If your base shield drops you will be attacked and you will lose resources. I only let mine drop if I want to get in a few attacks, then it goes back up. Don't get too frustrated if you get attacked because that's just part of the game. And you can lose troops on tiles as well so expect that to happen at some point too AND DON'T SEND OUT YOUR COMMANDER.2. Probably spend $5. Work through what you can first, but I've gotten pretty far on $5 as depending on what you get you'll unlock blueprints, a lot of speedups, research files etc. I may end up spending $20 but we'll see. Keep in mind once you spend 5 or 20 the cost of the packages goes up and stays up. After you spend that initial 5 you won't see a $5 one again so choose wisely.3. Time building up your base with challenges when you can. If you complete a challenge (like Build, Research, Train, Repeat) then wait for it to refresh before you start building up again.4. Try to join a large alliance. There are alliance challenges that reward you big for having a lot of alliance members that complete them. Plus you'll stock up on a lot of items by collecting alliance gifts and buying things with loyalty points (which you earn for free) in the alliance store. And if your members are nice they'll help you out with items and resources.5. Collect as many resources, speedups and research files as you can. Even if it seems like you're getting a lot, trust me, you'll need them later. Some research requires billions of resources, a million files and 1000 days to complete so collect what you can.6. Research your butt off and use things like commander armor and mods to give your base some building and research boosts.7. Pay attention to state boosts. These change and sometimes one will pop up that will give you access to research that you didn't have before by providing the first 1000 files or 100% of the time and/or resources.There are lots of other things to mention but these will help you a lot if you decide to try it out. At the end of the day spending money is your choice so if you're prone to getting sucked in and spending too much then I would not recommend this game.",Yes
"i will say Phil has a point, however, i disagree with the whole ""lawsuit"" stuff.  He said he purchased the packs; not once; not twice; but 6 separate times.  After the first or even second time spending $100 why not stop there if you didn't like it? BTW, the packs start out low.  4.99, then the second one will cost you 19.99, then i believe 49.99 or 99.99.  I forget.  it's been a while since i purchased a pack last.If you want to play this game do your research.  If you do not feel like doing your research then play some other game.  If you read up and speak to the ""good-guys"" in the game (there are some not so nice players that will not give you good advice; there are kids that play this game as well as adults so expect immature comments in chat) that are with an alliance ask them questions.  you'll probably learn that if you're fortunate to be accepted by an alliance there will be other players willing to help you with advice, resources, and even gold.  Yes, these items are necessary to play the game and get somewhere in it.  I've been playing for SEVERAL months now and the most I have spent on this game is about $150.  i'm sitting at about 1.5 billion power, Level 61 Commander, VIP level 92, over 2million in gold, and billions in resources.  not a bad spot to be to start really getting into the attacks :-)I will also say this: yes, it is a challenging game.  there is SOOOOO much that was thought about when the developers created this game.  They are obviously good at what they do.  I'm STILL learning new things and how to setup my gear, add boosts, etc.  The learning isn't stopping.  Know that this isn't simply a game you open up and it just goes.  If you want to be good at this game you will put in some long hours of playing. It will be a little boring at first but that is only because your base will start out small and you have to build it up from scratch.  That takes time.  Be patient.As far as the failed packs, that has never happened to me so I cannot speak on that.  I'm sorry Phil didn't have fun playing this game.  I'll admit, I've gotten pretty angry at myself a couple time forgetting to refresh my shield and got attacked and cleaned out while i was sleeping.  But you learn and move on.  Now I set alarms on my phone to remind me to reset my shields.  Hahaha! I know that sounds ridiculous, but that is just me.  You certainly do not have to be that serious with it but it helps.I hope anyone who downloads the game enjoys it.  I am.",Yes
"Seemed to run smooth on IPAD at first but I think they just added too much to the game where the high crash rate of the app has reached an unacceptable level.  I foolishly just threw money into a money pit and regret ever spending a dime to play this game.  Customer service has not been much help and I'm now disputing my purchases with both Itunes and possibly my credit card company to see if I have a case.Though in the end I guess I eat it since all sales are so called final however as a paying customer, I'm not getting what I pay for which is quality and stability.  The ideal was to play on a mobile device to give me something to do however I think the lack of maintenance has just destroyed my faith where I question getting sucked in further to any game which requires $$$ to progress.  There are many decent games out there that won't drain your wallet but to each their own.All I can say is I'm not getting my money's worth thus the reason for the negative review.  This has possibly become a case of gross negligence or let the buyer beware.  Just an FYI on what to expect on some devices.",Yes
Ripoff. Stay away from this game.  Can't believe there isn't a class action law suit against this developer yet.,Yes
"As others have mentioned, the gold packs are ridiculously weak. If you don't want to spend money don't play this game. If you have thousands to spend on a game that offers nothing for your investment then, be my guest, but don't think you can get over by trying to play without spending thousands of dollars. Imho, it takes at least one pack per level up of your base. The game offers challenges, but the pay outs are even weaker than the gold packs. The amount of rss and gold u spend to reach a goal are100x more than the payouts. If the packs were 5 bucks each it might be doable. $100 a day won't get you to the top at their current price.",Yes
I like the game I like the Alliance challenges I can't wait till they update  the game were you can get a alliance city,Yes
"Installed fine, graphics look good. Literally everything else about this game is awful. Too linear, not enough action....OK I can deal with that. But EVERYTHING on the screen is there to make you pay money. Between interstitials and bonus challenges that can only be accessed if you pay money, it leaves a sour taste in your mouth. I LITERALLY spend more time ""x""ing out pay-for pop-ups than progressing my character. It's embarrassing and makes you wonder how much money they paid Arnold that they need to make a crappy money sacking game to recoup it. Stay away",Yes

"Not surprised at what the game consists of. My first thoughts were, &#34;Oh, a new game by MZ, how are they going to suck us bone dry of out money this time?&#34; Well, it's really just what GoW was, but with a military theme. Nothing was changed, it still tries to convince you into throwing your credit card at them, and they STILL have the audacity to call this game &#34;addictive&#34; when, again, it's just GoW with a military theme. MZ wasn't even TRYING to be creative!After you finish the tutorial which, still, is the exact same as GoW's, it shoves a 5$ &#34;offer&#34; for you. Innocent enough. Right? Not really. After that, 5$ changes into 20$, 20$ into 50$, and 50$ into 100$. It really is just a sick copy of GoW. I didn't even kid with myself that I would ever touch one of those &#34;deals&#34;, because I tried to play GoW for a week, I joined an alliance, but since I hadn't bought one of those cheap tricks, people were constantly telling me to &#34;kill youself n00b&#34; or &#34;u suc at this&#34;. I'm only 15 and I'm assuming these people are in their 20s and yet, they're acting like we're on the second grade playground. Same goes with MS. No one has any respect AT ALL.I could really go on and on about MZ and GoW and MS and the next scam MZ will be releasing next week, but really it won't do anything. MZ will continue to treat the players like property, like a juice box they're sucking dry and throwing into the garbage. MZ and everyone working there is pathetic. They probaly have more money than Donald Trump himself, and they're probably living it up in a mansion, showing off their 48 different shades of vintage green race cars, to some girls they found on the street. I think I'm going to stop ranting over MS stupidity, because (unlike the ones who play this game) I have a life.",Yes
"I love this game. I wish I could play it all the time. But..... I have some issues with it, too. It lags. And I mean, a LOT. Constant glitching, takes a while to load, and sometimes it will even exit the app. Its so frustrating. Plus, when I'm trying to talk to my alliance, sometimes the keyboard won't show up, and if it does, I'll get one word and the app will glitch again sits that the keyboard doesn't come up. It makes me very sad, because I really do love the game!Money. It always wants money. Now, I don't think this would bug me, but every time I open the app an ad pops up, and the game glitches while its doing this, so I accidentally tap the ad and it messes me up. My screen usually goes gray,  and then the parental controls password pops up (because I'm 11, and I'm not allowed to purchase anything without my parent's  permission). Then when I finally get out of that gray screen, the game lags out of the app.Its sad, because I really do love this game. I just barely gave it four stars, only because I love it, but at the same time it makes me so angry.If you could possibly upgrade it so that other doesn't lag or make ads pop up every five seconds, this would be a complete 5 stars. Please upgrade.I hope this was of use for all who read it!",Yes
"These games are getting out of control when it comes to in app purchasing.  This is one of them.  It does not let the player play the game without somehow sliding in somewhere on an already crowded screen to use gold/buy gold, VIP Package this, War Crate Package that, buy X-Gold get ""Blah Blah Free"".  It gives me the feeling of playing at a sleezy casino.  The commercials are very misleading.  Combat only makes up a small portion of it.  Have fun upgrading your farm to a level 2, then level 3, then level 4, then you can't upgrade your armory to level 3 because your quarry is not a level 4 yet and so on...  If you have the time to monitor 15 or so tasks that take anywhere from 3:00 to 3 hours each on a daily basis then this game is a great fit for you!",Yes
A good game if you have deep pockets.  To be competitive you will need to spend hundreds of dollars..  the only way to win the game challenges is to buy the special packs..  their packs are $99.99. You may get lucky and find one that works for you at $49.99. And once in a blue moon a pack for $19.99. But it won't help unless maybe you get 2.,Yes
"Game could have marines, navy seals, military dogs, snipers, creating your own commander, plus seeing your army attacking the enemy's base and telling them where you want them to go when attacking.",Yes
"I have the same problem as a lot of other players. I'm willing to dump money into a free-to-play game if it entices me and is fun to play. Good developers deserve that, and at the start the game is addicting to build, employ strategy, and build your alliance. But give it a few days, and somehow you become cannon fodder for long time (or deep pocketed) players that teleport their base to your doorstep, and possibly that of your entire alliance, and hit you with full force before leaving right after (our state #300 COCA). In a matter of seconds, everything you built over the course of a few days goes to the bench for rebuilding or worse.Better yet, the stronger alliances impose restrictions on how you play the game, such as when you are allowed to attack or who can go where. It's like being given a chance to play in a world where a large group of people can play dictator and tell you how you play the game. And if you dare challenge it, they've got players who are on constant alert to take everything you've got. I broke a Non Alliance Pact, someone reported me (seriously) to a higher player (not developer), and I was attacked within 60 seconds. In my gaming experiences, it's one of the most frustrating things to experience when trying to get into a game. Look at the message boards in game and people refer to them as ""bullies"".I know what free-to-play means with these games, and you've got to dump some coin sometimes to get ahead. But with players like these scouting your every move, there's relatively no chance you can really find ways of having fun challenging other players. Unless you came into some serious money or have so much disposable income that you use it to wipe yourself, don't even waste your time getting involved with this game. Unless you're into electronic abuse. Then by all means, dive in and enjoy the taste of your tears.Worst game experience ever...",Yes
"Forget the lies you are told about ""free"".  this game is NOT free.  True, the download is free, but if you want to play the game in any meaningful way, be prepared to spend money, big money.  To the tune of several hundred dollars (or equivalent for foreign purchases).  It takes money for every item in the game, period.  Speed up's are a good example.  Do you need speed ups? Well, you decide, do you want to wait for 711 days (that's over 2 years) for a research item to finish so you can be rewarded for another deployment slot?  And 711 days is a LOT of speed ups, and each one costs money.  And get ready for in-game purchase failures.  I've purchased 6 ""packages"" so far (that's $600 folks!!) and 2 of those have failed.  The first time Amazon refunded my money, the 2nd one, yesterday (6 August 16) is ""pending"".  You want to sit around waiting for ""pending""?  I'm NOT happy about dropping $100 and waiting on what they foolishly call ""tech support"".  Bottom line, don't believe the lies, this game is one thing, and one thing only, a huge money suck.  Personally, I'm thinking class action lawsuit, all I need is an attorney that will take it on.",Yes
"Don't waste your time (or money) with this game.  I foolishly played this game for a couple months and spent a fair amount of money.  I will tell you all you need to know:-There is literally nothing to do in this game. After you get over the ""excitement"" of upgrading buildings and troops you'll discover that those cool looking battles you see on the commercials are no where to be found.  Battles take 2 seconds and have zero interaction and are completely determined by the AI.-You can spend $100s of dollars on this game and quickly realize that's just barely enough to get off the ground.  The top players spend $1000s of dollars on this game.  Prepare to get stomped every day by these players.-There is no skill involved in this game. It is purely who can spend the most money and spend the most time online.-The penalty for losing battles is incredibly high. The top players can cut your whole army down and take all your resources without batting an eye.  These armies can take weeks to build up and can disappear in 2 seconds.-You can't have a life and play this game. If something distracts you from logging in and checking on your base you will constantly lose everything in your base.  If you can't login at least once a day just forget it.  It gets to a point where all you are doing is rebuilding and not actually progressing.This game is just a giant scam and plays off of people's emotions to pump more of their hard earned dollars into this game.  My advice is to save your time and money and get any other game besides this.",Yes
"mKvVAt first, this game can be quite fun; however, you will quickly realize that the game is controlled by players that have spent $10000 and more which are virtually unstoppable due to the game mechanics. These high players go around attacking relatively new players for their RSS/resources and sooner or later you will be on that list. Not to mention, the game developers are always releasing upgrades which you can only get by spending some cash.You have 2 choices when playing this game:1. Constantly open your wallet to buy $100 packages. And even if you decide that, there will be someone else that will spend more making your investment worthless.2. Not spend any money but instead be constantly attacked for your hard earned resources.I have spent quite a bit in this game and it has been one of the biggest let downs ever. If I were you, I would not spend a dime for this game or you will come to regret it.",Yes
"I like these kind of games ,but they get me bored easily. I like choosing where to lace my buildings not on the plots.",Yes
"Not free to play even a kittle . yes the game is technically free to play. But the progression is so slow that you can count yourself out. There needs to be a way to develope states where only free to play are at. There needs to be a way to keep the big people (spends of hundreds of dollars) away from small purchasers. There needs to bef balance to this game for it to be fun. Its all fun and games till your spending money on shield every 3 days to make sure u can survive another couple of days. Also you will need to controller the ""loaders"" problem (there are people who will go out purchase ur packs and charge a fee to load them). This is a huge problem as well in this game. You also could look into the actual constant promotions eveytime you log in. This game was fun. It was... But then you start to see as you hit 25m another player can completely destroy you at 4billion. This literally sets you back 1 month or 49.99. The choice is yours. I do not recommend this game to anyone unless you have 1000.00 to spend on it right away. Good luck to the people who decide not to listen to my advice.",Yes
"As someone who is well versed in the world of gaming, the lag is terrible. I've played it in multiple locations each a different wireless range and the lag is the same across the board. Considering that I use a 4th gen Kindle Fire HD; this troubles me. With the fact that the tablet I use is a quad-core; I shouldn't have this much lag in any scenario. I am glad at least that the game itself is free and I understand that the developers have to make some money. But I will not deny my distaste of the game's favoritism to the pay-to-win faction. As for the advertising; once again I understand that in order to get such a game out there, it takes quite a bit. But I think that Arnold Schwarzenegger was a bit overkill. My advice to the developers: try the Linux approach. It's not supposed to be about the money. It's supposed to be about bringing people together to have fun. If the game were truly equalized; I know for a fact that the game would gain more positive reviews at a faster than that of which can be seen the day I posted this comment: 198 people said 5 stars. 254 people said 1 star.",Yes
I love this game I thought it was gonna be one of the games in this genre that would be boring and I would just uninstall the game but this is amazing 2 days and I'm totally hooked !!!!!!!!,Yes
"While a good game, it needs some minor bug fixes and increase the game's smoothness. The details are very good, and they pay attention to the details. While people complain about the side packs and value deals, there is nothing wrong with them. There is nothing wrong with the game, it's only people blaming their own lack of self control on the game and saying that the developers are evil, when they are just trying to make a living. Don't blame the game on your own lack of self control, this is a very good game. I will give it 5 stars once they fix the performance. It is a great game.",Yes
"Remember the good old days when you and your friends would take turns throwing $20 bills into a fire?  Then, after a few hours, whoever threw the most bills into the fire was declared the winner?  Wasn't that fun?  No?  Then, you probably shouldn't download or play Mobile Strike (or Game of War).  Your power level in the game is a function of how much you are willing to spend.  If you spend $100/month, you will be much more powerful than free players.  If you spend $500/month, you will be much more powerful than the $100/month players.  If you spend $1,000/month, you will be much more powerful than the $500/month players.  It's that simple.  If you are a free player, you will spend much time and frustration playing a crippled version of the game while the $$ players farm you over and over again while you can do nothing.  If you can put up with that for more than a few months, then bless your heart.If you are reading this review and have never really had much exposure to a true pay to win game, you might be thinking I'm exaggerating that someone would spend $1,000 a month on a mobile game.  Oh, I wish I was -- the bigger spenders (whales as they are known in the industry) easily drop that much and more.  In Game of War, this game's direct predecessor and almost identical clone that has been operating for a few years, the biggest whales have easily surpassed $100k in lifetime spending on the game.  And, while some can no doubt afford it, I am 100%, no doubt, guaranteed certain that many have gone into debt, maxed out credit cards, and ruined their lives and their families trying to keep up.  It is an addiction related to and probably very similar to a gambling addiction.  Machine Zone/Epic War (Same company) are VERY VERY good at getting you hopelessly hooked even if you think you'd never be susceptible to that kind of thing.I would not recommend it for anyone to play because:1) The gameplay is addictive, but not fun.  Most of the game consists of variation of clicking button to get awards or prizes.  If you get really into it, you will find yourself spending countless hours on it building, researching, training, opening, using times, logging onto farm accounts, trading, and more but most of this stuff soon becomes tedious chores you MUST do just to be able to keep your account competitive and the times you actually spend attacking other players are few and far between.2) There is always a bigger fish.  Any reasonable spending budget will be dwarfed by the biggest players in the game.  The only way to become a top player is to throw caution to the wind and probably max out a few credit cards.  Even then, there will always be someone else who is willing to spend a little bit more or has a little bit higher credit limit.  It's a never ending race you will never win.3) Important: If you have issues with compulsiveness, addiction (especially gambling addiction), self control, budgeting, unrestrained competitiveness or easily succumb to peer pressure, I cannot stress how important it is to never, ever start playing this game.  The very first time you open the app -- before you even start really playing -- you are bombarded with ads and offers to buy your progression in the game.  When you first join an alliance, you will feel pressure to grow your account faster so the alliance will be more powerful.  Every single new feature or new power boost they release will be behind a paywall that you will have to purchase.  You are the type of person they target -- people who have to play everything to completion, people who can't stop and walk away after losing $500 on the black jack tables, and people who have to be the biggest/best at something no matter what.It is quite common for whales in this game and others like to say things like, ""I've invested $10,000 into this account."" instead of ""I've spent $10,000 on this account.""  It's some kind of weird coping mechanism that they believe their money is being used to invest in something rather than being thrown away and it shows you how far gone most of them are.  While it's true that you can sell your accounts (against the terms of service of the game), you will usually only get a fraction of what you've spent in return and the buy/sell markets are rife with scammers on both sides -- people who take your money and not turn over the account or take it back after the transaction is complete or people who will take your account without paying.  Also, since it is against the terms of service, the account may be deleted if the game makers find out.TLDR: Stay far, far, far away.",Yes
"This app looked interesting, but, once I started to realise how difficult it was to actually get going with this, I ended up deleting it.  I thought it was just going to be a simple 'shoot-'em-up' type of game!  Unfortunately (for me anyway), it wasn't!!",Yes
It's not a bad game I got hooked easy it's great to build but on cons side you get booted every ten minutes on a good day you get longer and you need to buy packages from √Ç¬£15 to √Ç¬£150 but graphics and challenges are rewarding,Yes
"Very slow, action not smooth or flowing. Have deleted this.",Yes
Game is very clunky and laggy seems to go no where. Adverts are lies of any action what so ever.,Yes
Not as fluid as I would have thought.,Yes
Not what I thought it was going to be like.,Yes
Suffers from the same problem as most of these games after an initial flurry of action you end up spending 90% of your time waiting for last thing you did to finish or spending a lot of money in little bits to speed things up. I was playing the version from the kindle app store and the slow down on it made the game practically unplayable with waits for a response to clicking a building or and upgrade sometimes taking minutes to appear. After trying to play several times during the day I can say that was a game issue not a hardware one.,Yes
"I'm writing a revised review after 6-7 days of playing the game. I originally posted 4 stars, but knocking this down to 2.Starting with the positive, there are a few elements of the game which are quite enjoyable and some pretty in depth and have received some thought from the developers. The base building element is quite good and the ability to customize your character and bases strengths and weekends by electing where to invest your skills/research time or what modifications you make upon your gear is pretty good too. However, you soon realize that there is very little else to the game. Basically the battle / 'mission' elements to the game are just lacking. Missions are basically an endeviour of clicking a start button, waiting for somewhere between 2 minutes to 2 hours to elapse and then clicking a 'collect' button - I wish I could say it was more exciting but that's it. You can wage battles against your opponents however - sound more promising? Well, you basically pick a base to attack, send your troops in, and await for them to return to here the outcome. You do not see the battle, fight the battle, influence the battle or have any real sway over its outcome as far as I can see. So you spend all your time in the game bascially just increasing elements of your base from one level to the next. Furthermore, because all base items are chained dependencies upon each other, actually your base customization is really poor. You must upgrade your Wall to upgrade your HQ, and you must upgrade your Iron Mine (I think) to upgrade your wall and so on and so forth. The chose you have of what to build becomes simply a matter of 'how many' of each item you choose to build.Next on my hit list to highlight is the games undeniable drive to have you spend your money. My character is on level 19 and has a VIP level of 7 after quite a lot of hours played this week, but for the grand total of √Ç¬£3.99 you can start at level 50 which a VIP level of 30. Else, given the exponential increase in time it takes to build, train and research i imagine that would take about 1 month. If you don't want to spend you have a long waiting game ahead to be anywhere near those players who do. At every turn the game tries to pries you from this 3.99 investment with extra base items, unlocks for various things, huge amounts of gold etc. Its a bit too 'in your face' for my liking. I'm open minded to spending money on a game - but I first seek to see if its a game i'd like to play for some time - but alas if I spent money on this game, other than having a more powerful base I don't see what for - there's so little else to the game play that it just all feels a little pointless.The final point i'd draw attention to is the games reliability. This may not be the same for all - I guess it could be devise related but while sometimes I can play the game for over an hour, at other times the game might just exit every few minutes forcing a constant reload. It becomes really frustrating. I'm using an Amazon Fire 7"" Tablet for the record.",Yes
"The games itself is good. The concept, the graphics, there are many things that make this game good....... however the developers are losing players fast not because the game isn't fun because it is. They are losing players mainly to the fact that they increased their prices of packs due to the demand (so they say) so because they've lost a lot of players ud of thought they'd lower the prices,  instead they've done tons of updates to try n make the game better n brought out new features.... Unfortunately that hasn't helped the game. They're focusing to much time on gears and equipment n new buildings when they need to go back n 're think something",Yes
Not what I thought it would be,Yes
It's fun and the  people are cool because y poo u can control them,Yes
No matter what internet speed you have the game remains clunky and slow to do anything. It spends more time trying to sell you stuff rather than creating a game worth playing.,Yes
"To start, ignore all the others saying it lags and crashes, because it just simply doesnt. Secondly its literally game of war fire age but modern days. I didn't really like fire age and thought this would be different, but was exactly the same. It disappointed me. Also, its constantly telling you to do recommended missions with a big hand pointing to the mission button which is really annoying. If you like game of war fire age and prefer modern wars rather than medevil wars, I highly reccomend it, but if not, leave this game uninstalled. If you want a great base building game, I'd reccomend star wars commander.",Yes
Free action packed game loved it,Yes
"Had to write this as if your playing on Amazon fire this will apply to you too,game crashes every 10 or so minutes, sometimes longer sometimes less. Starts with chat crashing ( keyboard keeps flagging on and off ) followed by an app crash.EW it should be noted haven't a clue on what customer service looks like, never mind being able to implement anyting. Contacted them several times, explaining the issue, their only response reinstall game ( have done this probably more times than I've played it now ) or check for updates which its been upto date everyday. Wouldn't be so bad but this app does require somesortof spending to fully appreciate the game and for those rare moments when it works, its a great game, its being let down by stability issues and poor customer / technical support.Honestly I'd avoid if I were you and try the same format just the medieval version Game of War.No stability issues there and better free bonuses.",Yes
Loads to 90%>and stays there. Never got it to work. Thought Amazon vetted these apps. Just junk,Yes
Not what I thought,Yes
Don't know what this is for. Thought it was to connect to telly.,Yes
"My wife thought it was a free streaming service. She was disappointed, to find out it wasn√¢??t.",Yes
Not what I thought it was. I thought it would be Quentin Tarantino movies and Grindhouse or Rob Zombie movies. Trust me that was not the case,Yes
Movie updates and coming attractions where are the new movies nothing new in three months.,Yes
"I ended up buying this app by mistake by selecting a movie listed as without adds thinking that I would see some details about the movie but No!"" it just signed me up (with automatic monthly renewals- which was hard to figure out how to turn off but that's another complaint) - no screen saying ""are you sure you want to purchase this app?'. I've since turned off in-app purchases - which I thought I had already done...",Yes
"I actually downloaded this because I√¢??d thought it would be great to watch something different however.. it has never worked from the very first use. It just sits on the start screen. No wonder it√¢??s completely free, absolutely rubbish.",Yes
"Worked great most the time and we really enjoyed the interface and music quality.  Had issues with the remote control feature stop responding after about 2 hours.  The fix was to log out and log back in, but then you lose your songs in queue.  Could be a 5 star app if bugs are worked out.",Yes
This app does not work correctly. They suck you into pay for a subscription and the features do not work. You won√¢??t know this till after they got your money. The remote control feature does not work on the Firestick. The other devices cannot send songs to the Firestick app because the developers left out the √¢??queue√¢?¬ù. You√¢??re supposed to be able to synch another device to the Firestick app and have the songs sent so they play on the tv but they don√¢??t because again the queue option is not there. So don√¢??t waste your money or your time,Yes
"I bought this for the grandkids√¢?? visit, not understanding that it was not like some other karaoke apps that will sinc to your TV for group fun. It doesn√¢??t. Too late, we found a free app that does...So- I have this useless $9.00 app for my phone that I√¢??m certain will never be used. I will do my best to try and remember to cancel it before the revolving charges start. Ugh.",Yes
"While this has the most song selection of many of the karaoke apps out there and the most supported platforms, I found great difficulty with the remote function while hosting a party. The remote function while it does work at times it√¢??s just not reliable enough. If having friends over everyone choosing their own songs and adding to a queue is a must. Without the remote function you can still choose songs with FireTV remote(slowly), so not a complete lost.",Yes
"Despite a lot of research prior to installing this on my FireTV and Android phone, I was not aware that this app does not allow for the singer's voice to be integrated into the song. This is not what I wanted on a Karaoke app. The only difference between pulling up a karaoke version of a song on YouTube and this app are a few features outlined below:PROS:-wide song selection-easy control of the volume of both the background vocals and the lead singer on the track-use multiple devices so singers can queue their own songs-not a bad price if you just want to subscribe a weekend every month or so and you need these featuresCONS:-the app is not designed to incorporate the karaoke singer's voice into the track as it plays",Yes
"The kids loved it, they had a blast! Good song selection and parental controls. Made her birthday party!!",Yes
"Great√¢?¬¶use monthly for Karaoke Night 75 -100 attendees. More than √Ç¬æ of √¢??Entertainers√¢?? have system at home and Rehearse for hours!Works great in big rooms with  good sound system.  It is much more pleasant listening when their song can play in a key that suits thesinger.  PLUS the good ones change up the speed, have 4-5 part harmony.  Job well done by RECISIO and the App is  KraFun  - Karaoke & Singing ...",Yes
"Needless to say, I was challenge be a sone whom I knew wasn't karaoke-inclined. One song winner takes all, download the app on cell and stick. Proceeding further information on how to make it work. The point isNeither of the apps worked. Quick uninstall for stick and cell.",Yes
They sucker punch you by telling you about a ton of features that are only available if you pay for VIP status.,Yes
"Stupid, I thought it was all done thru the app",Yes
It would not let me sign in! It just kept loading. I thought I was doing something wrong so I checked my email to see if it was wrong and it was not. So I tried a few more times and it still didn't work!!!!!!!!√∞??¬≠√∞??¬§,Yes
"I really thought there would be more free music, my friends claim it gets better.  they all have it for their phones but on my tablet it's not what i was hoping for. perhaps it will grow on me.",Yes
"I had it, i thought it was going to be fun but its so stupid",Yes
"I'm afraid it doesn't work on kindle as well as I thought.I tried to play my recordings and it didn't. I'm still gonna keep it and see if I did something wrong, maybe it's just me. Anyways I hope you have a good day~",Yes
"I got this app for my kindle fire hd thinking it would be awesome but boy was I wrong. When I first tried it and it didn't work I thought it was the settings that I picked, so I tried a different setting but it still did not work. I ended up trying all of the setting but it still did not work. I would give this app zero stars if I could.",Yes
"Its a momentary pleasure and quite entertaining but has no lasting value. The selection that I really enjoyed was reverse. Made me laugh so hard. Also, once a selection (voice change) is saved it is not easily retrievable from my phone. I went to the obvious places where I thought it might be stored and it wasn't there. I dont like that that.",Yes
I THOUGHT THIS APP was awsome but NO IT IS A HORRIBLE APP!!!!!!!!So if you think it's a cool APP ITS NOT ITS A HORRIBLE APP IT JUST DOSNT WORK FOR KINDLE FIRE!!!,Yes
I got this app cause I thought it will give me a voice recognition to change my pitch but just so u know........ KINDLE FIRES DON'T HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION!!! not for Kindle Fire,Yes
"Novelty,  easy to use",Yes
The kids loved this! Our agent scanned them and then held it where they couldn't see. Worked perfect for &#34;security clearance&#34; test!,Yes
"Not that it did the following times, but c'mon people, it's a gag app - It's not supposed too.  Still, thought it was kinda amusing.",Yes
my friend tried it and he thought he was 490 years old then I told him the trick. My... Okay no my...  everybody thought it was terrible except my friend.,Yes
"I actually fell for it....... feel kinda stupid actually.  I thought this would read my thumb print - as I was sitting there with my thumb pressed up against the screen it finally hit me, this is just a screen with no scanning functionality.  LOL",Yes
This app is nice not what I thought. I thought it would tell my real age but it was 30 years off. It said I was 40. Don't get this app plz,Yes
Thought it to be inaccurate. A silly app. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I wouldn't use it again and you shouldn't offer it.,Yes
Quite the fun gag. I changed my age up and down by several years every time I tried it. A novelty I had fun with but have since removed.,Yes
"This was an app my 10 year old daughter wanted. She thought is was funny, but soon got bored since it really only does one thing.",Yes
"This piece of junk thought I was 58! I'm only 57! Just kidding. But really, they make some pretty bad guesses...",Yes
"Not as much fun as I thought it would be, kind of a waste of time.  This is a disappointing app.",Yes
Ok so I thought it would actually know my age but the first time it said I was 17 which I am not then 48 then 21 lol it's just a joke people so hopefully people read my comment,Yes
"Seriously i got scared by this app! 1st time i did it the app got my age right!! I thought it was creepy and kinda funny. If it gets your age wrong then don't get mad, it's just a game!",Yes
"Dumb. It doesn't do anything. I thought it would be fun. Maybe it would use some math trick, but all it does is throw out a number. It's not even funny.",Yes
it sucks it thought i was 78!im 21!,Yes
"First of all I downloaded this on my sleep over, I had a lot of people over and we found this app and thought it would be cool and fun... ACTUALLY the complete opposite! To test it out to see if it worked' I tried two times and got 29 and 25. I even had my 3 year old sis do this and she got 31! But I gave it a star because it's funny to see how they age you. But also a waste of time!",Yes
I think it sucks because I thought it would be correct,Yes
When I first got this app I thought it would be cool and actually work. When I scanned my thumb it said I was 24 years old when I am only 13!,Yes
When I saw this app I thought it would be fun and I was WRONG! This app was a complete waste!!,Yes
DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!!!!This app is so in inaccurate. It thought I was 46 years old when I'm only 9!,Yes
"Hello:3 how r u guys. Today I'm reviewing Age scanner. Yes it sometimes gets it right for me but idk about you guys. So I think it's ok to waste free time on. And yes it's funny to see my parents reaction when there like 100 years old:). It's good for pranks, and good for fun so buy it if you like games like that.",Yes
I Don't  really care for it  at first I thought it would tell you're real  age so I began to  play it and I didn't like it.,Yes
"I read some other reviews and I don't know why everyone is so mad. Do you really think a random app on your device is going to tell your exact age?? It might say your super old, but it's just an app, it's not like it's an actually person judging you. I'm 12 and it said I was 48. I thought it was pretty funny. Learn to laugh ppl!!",Yes
This app does not work it said I 47 years old bull crap.it also thought I was 18 yet I'm not don't get this app is sucks,Yes
This game has no idea how old I am it says you are 44 you are 54 and all that!It doesn't even tell the truthI think nobody should get it √∞??¬¨ I thought it would be so cool √∞??¬¢This hurt my feelings a little bit  like an arrow through your heart√∞???So so so so so so so so so so so so so so disappointingDo NOT get this appIt's super disappointing,Yes
This is really stupid. it kept telling me im in the 20s all the time. im only 10!  i thought it will be close to my age but it wasnt. it said i was 26  then 25 then 23 . IM ONLY TEN!  maybe it will be close to your age but it was more than a ten year difference. That is my opionion!,Yes
Not what I thought,Yes
Doesn't work! Even at a novelty it's a waste if time and memory. Don't do it! You.ll thank me later!,Yes
the age scanner is okay.I thought it would actually tell my real age. i just use it for pranks on my family,Yes
"Age scanner is a good novelty app; which is also it's weakness in that the fun wears off quickly it is not a knock of the quality of the app, but rather how novelty apps lose their appeal after the first hundred tries. Still worth the download.",Yes
This game is the absolutely most horrible game EVER. It thought I was 47 and I'm not even 15 yet. Take my advice and DON'T get this app. I Wish I could give this game zero stars.,Yes
"This was an interesting novelty for about five seconds, after that - useless, even more useless than it was intended to be.",Yes
Just watch your friends' reactions and the excuses they come up with for having an age guessed that is vastly different to their real age. :D,Yes
I thought it actually worked. Disappointed.,Yes
This app is ok but it does not tell you your real age but it is quite funny when it said I am 190 because I'm only 10 . But if you are over 30And you thought it was real then by better games. So this came is fine .,Yes
Totally useless not at all what I thought it would be. need to go to 1mobile and download the real chromcast app,Yes
Chrome cast delivers .= a good serviseBut the controls would not work on my Kindle :(It works on my husbands phone,Yes
Waste of time why would you need this not what I thought,Yes
I thought this was a countdown timer. I could not figure out a way to set a time so that this could be useful to me. This app has been absolutely pointless.,Yes
"Not what I thought it was, just numbers scrolling really fast. Settings wouldng load to find if there was a way to change it",Yes
"I recently moved back home. This house has always had a lot of paranormal activity. It didn't take long for the activity to start up again. I decided to get this app. I always thought a few of the spirits in the home are deceased family members. This app confirmed my suspicions. Words, names, and nicknames that the deceased people in my family know are used started showing up at the top of the screen.  Due to so much activity over the years I thought that maybe there was something about my neighborhood that made the paranormal activity so strong. I was right. According to one spiritIf you ask questions, more than likely they will answer. If you purchase this app, please be careful. Evil deities will come through as well if you seek them.",Yes
"I was actually looking for an EVP app when I came across Ghost Radar and even after reading up on it I know relatively nothing about how it works. BUT I never considered it anything more than a novelty... AND THEN!!!!One night just before bed I decided to turn it on.The word ""Observe"" popped up. If something was there it seemed to be saying, ""Hey pay attention... listen up.""I was like alright, you got my attention.Then the words, "" Lee does great."" Shot out one after another. This had never happened before. I had used the app for about a week before this, and sometimes the app will run and nothing will come up at all, then at other times random words will come up but they rarely make any sense, and are all spread out, but 3 words at a time, right after another... I hadn't seen this before. My hair stood on end. Lee was my grandfather who had recently passed on.In addition, my wife can see ghosts. She has been able to see them since she was a little kid. Before my grandfather, Lee, passed away I asked him to come back if he could to let me know how he is. Being a Firm Bible believing Christian, I was sure things were good but I just wanted him to come back. Well, about a month ago she saw his spirit. She was working on her laptop one night in bed and just as she was turning it off she looked up and there he was, so this wasn't the first time my grandfather had made his presence known. My little Ghost Radar says, ""Lee does great."" I was actually a little shocked.""Grandpa, is that you? Are you in the presence of God?""""Freedom"" Comes the squeaky little voice from over my phone. LOL, I just started laughing! Let me tell you, the hair was standing strait up on the back of my neck!! I was VERY  pleasantly freaked out!!BUT even if this event had not happened, I would still give Ghost Radar 5 stars.  I don't understand why anyone would rate this app any less. What in the world are people actually expecting? To really contact ghosts? There is only one ghost you need to contact... the Holy One.Peace!",Yes
"As some say, the ""jury is still out"" on if ghosts do indeed exist. I only wanted to see this app in action but did not use to any significant enjoyment. 3 stars for the confusion I am experiencing over the inclusion of the word ""Classic"" in the title. -Glon",Yes
"I got the ""Connect"" version of the Ghost Radar after downloading this app, and have had some good fun with it. This version is much more simplistic, as all it is is the radar and words, but in all reality that's good enough. The Connect version has a ""Vox"" box added into it, but I honestly don't even know what I'm looking for with that, so it doesn't mean anything to me. It also has a camera added into it so you can take pictures, a flashlight button (that doesn't even use my actual light, just turns the screen white), an audio recording button (which can be fun to use), and a ""night"" mode, which turns your screen a dark red. There is also a tab which shows the time and date of all the past recordings you've done, along with past blips on the radar (and how close they were), and past words that have been said. The Connect app is cool if you're really wanting and/or trying to catch some activity, but if you don't really care all that much, this version will be fine. Only reason I gave it four stars is because I'm not 100% sure it's legit. Download it and see for yourself if you believe it to be real or fake.**Please note: The Connect version of this app requires it to ""warm up"" before getting accurate readings. Meaning it has to take a bit (I'd say it typically takes about 20-30 minutes to warm up) to adjust to all the surrounding noises before any of the readings could be considered legit. There are no lights on this app to show whether it's warmed up yet or not, (there's a red, yellow, and green button on Connect that indicate how warmed up it is) but I assume it's the same for this app and still requires warming up. That being said, don't trust or believe the dots that pop up or words that are said as soon as you open the app, there is a high probability that there is nothing paranormal about these. On an ending note, it is said that putting the scan frequency on the ""Low"" setting gives you more accurate readings as well, as it doesn't pick up as much stuff, meaning the stuff that it DOES pick up is more likely something paranormal. However, as the description is falsely put (and as Spudd Pickles says himself) your phone/tablet is not capable of picking up EMF (electromagnetic fields). The theory is that intelligent entities can pick up on the fact that they can influence words on your phone, or show themselves through it. Your phone does not and cannot pick up EMF signals however.",Yes
"Whether or not you believe, this app will DEFINITELY make you question the possibilities! Eerily relevant responses from ""the unseen realm""! Seriously, though, I bought this as a lark, expecting very little. However, within minutes of starting the radar, I was quite unnerved by some of the words coming through.Also, I know plenty of Kindle Fire users are complaining about not having a microphone to pick up voices, but I find that to be a benefit, as the app can't confuse random surrounding sounds as possible voices. O simply explain out loud that any entity that wishes to communicate can simply use the Kindle to speak to me. I have had very impressive sessions with different people, and different locations, each situation having different interactions, and outcomes.Just give it a fair try, and I promise you shouldn't be disappointed.",Yes
"Guys, this thing is no joke. I went with my father and step mother to an old civil war battlefield a few nights ago. (I had downloaded this app one week prior) I started the app and started asking questions most people would ask a ghost. Who are you? Is there anyone here? I had a camera set up to film everything. I set down my kindle fire to check the video then I hear the word ""college"". I'm a college student. I brushed it off and kept checking the camera then it says ""surrounded"" and I get a chill down my spine. I went to check it and the screen showed 4 bright red signatures. Now THAT got my attention. I went back to the camera (this time with the kindle to watch the signals) and kept doing what I was doing. Occasionally, I would look at the screen the check those signals. They were still there. They had not moved. I could feel eyes on me. Watching me. I hear ""blood"" come on the app. At that point, I realized it was time to go. Coincidence? Maybe. But to me, I was about to **** my pants.",Yes
"Don't really know what to say about this one... the kindle fire is not exactly built with quality ghost electricity detection capabilities.  Still, it is a fun little program on Halloween night when exploring a spooking location, or if you want to make yourself hyper-aware at one o'clock in the morning and have nightmares.",Yes
I love this app. So today I saw a red dot on the radar and then it said petty then I saw it again  only a lot farther away from me!Then I saw and heard the words stronger. Then I thought it was my grandmother that past away when I was six years old. I don't live in her hours I live a lot farther than away from her. I really think this app is very creepy and cool.P.S I am eight years old.,Yes
"Nevertheless I thought that my dad's house isn't haunted, then I saw this app and decided to give it a try. As soon as I turned the app on, red, green, blue and yellow dots appeared in random places. I first asked what is your name and then it's MAGIC. I then asked is your name MAGIC and it said AUNT. I was looking at the backyard and it said FENCE. I asked you saw the fence and no reply. After a few minutes of no activity, two red dots appeared at the top right of the radar and asked who are you and other questions it said OLD. I asked are you old or is it the house. The I asked to show up on the radar as a red dot if it is their age that is old or show up as a blue, yellow, or green dot if the house is old. A few minutes later, two yellow dots came up. MY WAS BLOWN AFTER THAT!!!!!! :P You should get this app.",Yes
"Another set of words came thru along with some anomalies, these were the words, in sequential order: warn, company, porch, and horse. I put it together and thought, could this mean a horse could show up on my porch and this is just a warning",Yes
"I'm not sure if I believe in this stuff but it was very interesting. My daughter got the app and after listning to her storys I thought I would get it. There wasn't much activity when I turned it on until my Husband walked in the room then there were 2 red dots on the radar and the word ""Established"" came up. I had just gotten out of the shower, talking to my husband, naked I might add, and the word ""Beautiful"" came up. Now I could flatter myself and think it was talking about me but I just brushed it off then I had to give my husband Insulin, 2 shots which he doesn't like very well and was grumbly about it, when I was through I looked at my Kindle and another word popped up, ""Necessary"" Coincidence? I don't know but it is very entertaining and I would recommend it for entertainment purposes.",Yes
AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS FAKE BUT I IS NOT FAKE IT IS ALSO SCARY I AM SCARED NOW,Yes
I stared this app up and dots appeared then it said the word GERMAN. I am from a German heritage so I think it pretty creepy that this app said that. Download this app it is very entertaining. PS you must turn on LBS for this app to work. ---NMS---,Yes
"I got this app just because I thought it would be fake and fun, but it's real! I was explaining to my little sister that there aren't ghosts in the kindle fire, but that there are ghosts in the room. After that , I said that a ghost is behind her, and sitting on her head, and the ghost said ""beside"" . Super cool!",Yes
"Well, I wouldn't consider this a fake ....but the likely possibility is that they just have random dots appearing and design it like a real ghost radar and have random common words appearing. I just downloaded it and when I opened my app, it was like ""pot "" and on the right side of me there was a flower pot. I thought it was cool, but come on, there are pots everywhere! either in your yard or somewhere else, you can always find something common with the random word that appears on the radar. Its a cool app, but in my opinion, they just choose a buncha random words that make you think this app can ""detect "" stuff when your fooling yourself out. I was using it this morning on my bed and it was like ""can, winter, principal ""?! Wtf, am I in school or something? lol but this app is worth the download even though it might be fake.",Yes
"When I was in my room I had my kindle turned on to this app.It kept saying stuff that didn't make sense but after an hour when it started getting dark out,there was at least six red dots on my screen,they were all around the screen but one did not move.I looked on the screen I thought it was actually really close to where I was sitting,it then said shoulder.I got a little freaked.I also asked some questions about back then when JFK was around and I said I bet he was a great president,it said agreed,I know what happend to the people in the house it was in the 60s they were around so I suggest if you know when the people lived in that house ask it questions when they were around,it really does work trust me.",Yes
"Okay so I bought this app and was like cool whatever and ignored it for a while. Today I looked at it in my room and I got a little activity. This is wat I got:(Top left corner activity level125) none realize | spreading log fire trouble | after that I was like woah is this real?and gotten word understanding. I shrieked and shut it off. Later I was watching the news when I saw a news report about a log fire at a camping sight. It had started 5 minutes before I started getting activity. Supposedly, some teenagers at a site  were  messing  around and then went to bed. None of the realized a fire had started and one of the teens was rushed to the hospital. So yea. Awesome app",Yes
when I got this app I thought it was cheap. where my family lives it used to be train tracks.... and while I was in the kitchen had two dots one was red and the other was blue ... I knew the red was me but the blue was in my garden where the train tracks were.this app tells the truth a ghost has been haunting me ever since I moved to this house . about when I was 6 a ghost was behind me and it felt like a gun was to my back..... I was fully awake!,Yes
So t is ok but don't know I mean it gave me like 5 dots as soon as I started I thought there might by 1 because the person that used to live here died in the basement before I moved in and that is kind of creepy and my house is just creepy anyway but I am thinking of bring it to my schools bathrooms because they are honted for sure so I might try there,Yes
First I thought that I didn't have ghosts but when I was taking my kindle downstairs  2 blobs came on and 1 of them turned blue and when I got 2 the 5th step it disappeared. That scared the crap out of me because I did think that the stairs were a little spooky.,Yes
"So, I downloaded this app. It was soooo freaky!!! At first, I was about to enter the shower when it said 'Water Running'. I looked, and the water was dripping. Creepy! Another time I thought is saw a ghost wearing a white dress once in the bathroom, and I stuck my Kindle in there, and it said White Ghost.Another time it said 'Bone Breaker' at a hotel, then 1 day later I fell down the stairs and broke my Arm. THIS THING IS REAL!!",Yes
Yeah I am a ghost. I downloaded this app and thought it was a joke/prank because it was 1 April. But I am a ghost remember. So I installed this app on my kindle fire HD. And it started detecting me as a ghost in the center of the radar. I was shocked that humans evolved so much that they left their work and started detecting me. How foolish of them. Then I was pretty much shocked and I fainted but a ghost does not faint so I got up. But more important it works so please all ghosts reading this review please download this app. And humans beware.  One day we will develop a app of detecting humans so don't worry. I am .,Yes
"This app seems to work very nice. Ghosts are in my house all the time-consuming I see, hear, and feel them. We had a Ouija board out and this app on and we got words that we didn't expect. We came to find that I have a three year old girl named Elizabeth, a boy which remains U.N. named, and an adult named Corey, aged 22. This app works, because right after my friend left I was alone in the house- I thought. I felt a freezing cold thin layer on my back, and the back of my arms, as if I was being protected out something. I heard a crash outside, and the feeling went away. Turns out, some kids were trying to scare me, but I had no idea who they were even! They walked away when they found out I had a knife, so I haven't seen them again. But it's weird, because they were dressed in old clothes; they were pale, and looked tired or sick. I'll never know! Just be careful, you never know what you're summoning...",Yes
"this app seems so real!  today my friend was drawing and she just drew a line then a ghost said underline. then later a bunch of ghosts showed up and we were all yelling and pointing at it and then a ghost said angry! I guess it was angry at us. another time, there was no ghosts for a long time then a whole bunch showed up all at once. we thought that was really weird.  then a ghost said mysterious! that is so creepy! later we were sitting by a brick fire place and then a ghost said brick! I doubted that this was real but now I'm not so sure'",Yes
"When I first got this app at my old house it worked and now at my supposedly ""New"" house it's working even more! I tried to go to the area it said a ghost was and once I went there I thought I saw somethingI do very recommend this but be warned, this will scare the crap out of you!",Yes
"When I got this app, I thought it would be fun for me and my brother. But istead, it gave me the creeps. I first thought my house was raided by ghosts. D: I felt like moving out at first. So be careful when playing this app!",Yes
I had the app an independent I was talking to my ex about how is sister died then it said hi √¢?¬¶√¢?¬¶√¢?¬¶ rylie√¢?¬¶√¢?¬¶√¢?¬¶√¢?¬¶ I'm √¢?¬¶√¢?¬¶√¢?¬¶√¢?¬¶√¢?¬¶ok √¢?¬¶√¢?¬¶√¢?¬¶√¢?¬¶√¢?¬¶√¢?¬¶hide I got really scared bc rylie is the boys name and she died Will playing hide and seek by falling down the stairs,Yes
"I downloaded this to creep out my wife. I fired it up and had it running when she entered the room. I explained that it will detect spirits and they can communicate to us through it. Our dog then entered the room and it said ""pony"". Our dog is very large and is commonly referred to as moose, horsey and...pony! I figured it was just a randomly generated word but decided to use it to tease my wife so I said ""There is a spirit trying to communicate with us and it saw the dog come into the room and called it a pony!"" It then said ""understanding""! It freaked us both out. I'm not going to show this one to the kids or they may not be sleeping well.",Yes
I thought it would be fun to play with my friend so w  we're walking all of a suddenit said trip about 10 second  later I tripped and dropped my  kindle then it said drop and a few minutes later we were practicing a cheer called jam an  it said jam then cheer we were so scared we literally ran into my room locked the door and covered ourselves in.  Blanket I believe in this app you should get it,Yes
"do i decided to use this app so i get on my kindle and start using it. its starts saying things like accident and hurt, car, flip, i was like ok creepy. so i walk out into the kitchen and ky mom is crying its turns out that my aunt rebecca was in a car accident and the far flipped 6 times and she and her newborn baby Henry my own fusing were severely hurt. i thought this was some stupid little app. after that i was really scared and was like wow i cant believe that worked with that accuracy. this is not something i would make up I'm telling the truth!!!",Yes
"as soon as I got it I opened it in my bed room, and the first thing it said was art and I have art stuff all around my room O.o I thought it was just a word bank that reads words randomly but then it said collection and I have a collection of nail polish in my room, and it said saturday and today is friday. then as soon as my mom left to go to go pick up my brother from school it said mom leave........... I don't know if something is here or not. I'm still going around with this thing but I am strong believer in ghosts.",Yes
Sometimes its a little small to handle on prestige 7 tablet I loved it.. But i wish it had a word list you could email to yourself like the legacy one.,Yes
"I would believe in this app. it's creative..whether or not that this is real, it certainly go me thinking..so recently we received progress reports stapled on the bullentin board with our id numbers to tell which grade was yours.. so I got a C..not my bestest grade and I was complaining about it all day..once I opened this app I thought it would be really neat to try it out..the first thing it said was 'mathematics' I was totally freaked! so ghost making fun of my math skills.... -.-",Yes
"When I first opened this app, it said 'brass'. I thought out loud saying ""I don't think I have anything brass."",Then a spirit replied 'try'.  I think what it meant was try to think. then it showed 2 spirits, one between me and the tv, and,one next to it. Its an old tv, so it might have brass in it. Me and my dad are extreme believers, so this really shocked me when it replied! Love this app. Get it!",Yes
"Although the readings were things we didn't really understand, it was still an adventure. I reccomend this because it gives you something to do c:",Yes
"Well I looked at all the reviews, and it came out pretty interesting. Of course, this app probably deserves a few more 5 star reviews considering that some kids thought it was a game. Its pretty cool, freaky, and sent chills up my spine. As people offered me to go walk, I declined. I then turned on the radar, and caught 2 words: didn't, walk. Creepy, but extremely interesting. Probably useful for freaking out friends, family, or little kids.",Yes
wen I was going to the liveing room it said gray..wich is the color of the walls..and I thought nahh it cant be..but then I went to the bathroom..and as son as I turns the light off..it said black..and also..it keep saying public and tables and beat..and the name of a friend..of mine...I think it may be trying to say that he well fight in school somewhere...sigh yup just like my friend is a hot head...hopefully I'm wrong...but this this app is the stuff.really creepy too......I mean really!!,Yes
I got this cuz I'm into the show ghost adventures. so I was like cool a ghost app (new it woulndnt work ) so I was playing around on it and I got a bit scared. then I read the reviews and some reviewer had said it said Jimmy. the first word the app said to me was Jimmy. they really should mix the words a bit better. but id say get it. its free and it provides entertainment like it should. would have gave it 4 stars if it mixed the words up better.,Yes
ok so I thought this was fake but I know in 1873 a girl was hanged for murderer and her ghost still lives here so one day I was on my ditecter and like 12 red dots came up and it said murder you than it said hanged and then my chair moved. and fell over . than when I was watching Tv then it turned off so I got my ghost radar and 1red dot was infront of me and than my baby brother was.crying and screaming then. I saw a fugure in my. brothers room then his door slammed.,Yes
"First off, I bought this because I thought it would be fun....wrong!! At first it was.....but then my daughter was playing on it and she figured out that it does not track ghosts but reads your apps instead!!! So don't be a sucker and get this app....just don't!!",Yes
"i downloaded it and thought it was fake but then.........i was playing around with it and it traked a ghost of a person who had the nickname of ""the jones"" and the word appeared ""jones"" and tons of other stuff but.....ill bore you",Yes
"I thought that this app would be entertaining for me for whenever I got bored. The first time I used it, the words that manifested were hit and miss. It was more accurate the second time. The third day, I thought, what the heck, I'll go to the cemetery and give it a shot. I went to my parents grave and talked to them for a few minutes. The first two words were: minute, longer. Then I asked my dad if he remembered when he told me that he would try to let me know that he was ok whenever he passed over. Right after that, his name popped up on my phone. I was speechless! I guess he was telling me to give him a minute longer to let me know that everything was good. It was a jaw dropping, yet, ecstatic experience that I will NEVER forget.",Yes
"Well when i first got this i thought in my mind ""this wont work ghost arent real.."" and right as i thought that a red dot appeared and it said evidence that creeped me out then it said wet which is weird because we have a leak in the house it also said mine but im not sure what that means anyway i think that this app works and is pretty cool and made me believe",Yes
My friend went to the closet to hang up some things and it showed up 2 green dots and a red one.and I said one dot is getting closer to you a green one.she said why?And the radar said safety and the red dot got really close to the other ones.The day before it said behind TV and there was a Tv behind me.It also said Greek happy cry and look.wow weird Wright?,Yes
"while exploring the yard all of a sudden it said EXPLORING IN DIRECTION and then I turned and then it said MARK FATHER it had amazing qualities and its not a waist if your time.You can't sit thinking they will come to you maybe they will, but go explore like me I explore cemeteries and the yard.Also by a metal gate it says magnet 100 TRUE",Yes
Best app ever it works 100% one day I went to my basement and turned the app on and it said I'm then your then great then grandpa witch I thought was really creepy because this used to be my great grandfathers house :0 hope this review helped u :),Yes
My daughter wanted the app so bad so I got it for her and said that a dot popped up and said I am sitting with u hi. She thought it was her dead brother at first this game is not fake trust me!!! Don't listen to the haters that say this isn't real cause it is!!,Yes
"one of the first words I herd was protection. so does this mean that its my gardian angel. but I also got help, taken, and stranger so I think there is more than one. plus it showed I had 3 in my living room. idk if I should be scared or not.",Yes
"I got this game a few weeks after I saw the Conjuring. I didn't believe that spirit stuff could be THAT crazy or dramatic. Some kids at my middle school believe I'm psychic. I sometimes see things, I sometimes hear things, and when I wake up in the morning after a dreamless sleep, I have (a) scratch(es). I'm not sure if I'm going then myself or there is some sort of spirit who likes or hates me. I've watched Celebrity Ghost Stories in the past but I stopped when I entered 5th grade two years ago. Now, as a seventh grader, I'm not interested in this stuff anymore. I got this app to see how fake it was. Our parents were asleep so we (my sister and I) thought that was close to""alone"" so I turned this on. We have had many pets before. They all died except one that I set free. When I started my homework, I saw a blue dot kind of behind-ish and right-ish. I looked at where you see communication and it said. I said hi and how are you. I said if you want me to turn it off to not die yourself. Nothing appeared so I kept my saying and came into here. This is a great app.Ooh! Just now I realized a dog died next door. When I said "" Bailey"" two dots appeared. More coming soon!",Yes
"Ok people, God is real, the devil is real, and angels are real. So are spirits! Sometimes ghosts seek revenge, or they are friendly. This app is real. Here are what the signals : red, it is very strong. Yellow, strong. Green, weaker. Blue, barely there. This is real. Here's what it did to me one time: I was on my kindle fire on the couch, and it said ""wind"". I thought it meant something, so I went to the weather channel. Believe it or not, but there was a big tornado watch in the south, thank goodness I don't live down there. I'm never trying in my bedroom, though. I'm afraid. I admit it. But this app is real. Trust me.",Yes
"I always enjoy watching Ghost Adventures and The Dead Files so downloaded this free for the fun of using it. When my son used it he got some action and a few words so he enjoyed playing with it. When I used it nothing, but still one of those things that is fun to pull out when you are bored to waste a little time. We have not tried it outside the home. I would like to point out that even the expert ghost hunters don't get action everytime they do a lockdown at a location so just have fun with it!",Yes
"Okay, about a month ago, I was in my room getting ready for school. I was in a cross between: a Gryffindor  sweat shirt with worn skinny jeans and Ugg boots or a Camp Half Blood t shirt with skinny jeans and high tops. So I asked the Ghost Radar,"" Oh wise and powerful ghost in my room, which shall I WEAR?!"" I waited.and waited.and waited. then I freaked out. it said:"" Wear, sweat, shirt"" I literally cried out in excitement!!!!! This ghost had taste like a huge nerd like me!!!!!Theresa(:",Yes
"A friend of mine downloaded this app for his smart phone, so I thought I'd try it. Not as fun as it looked.",Yes
"first time I had a paranormal experiance with this app I was in an old hotel from the cival war. a dot popped up, and I asked it who he was. it answered,BEN. I asked if he was the previous owner of the hotel. it answered, SOLDIER.Another time, in my house, it was on, and a dot popped up. I asked who it was, and it did not answer, so iasked where it was from. it said, Africa. A few minutes later, it said cotton, so I began to think a cotton slave was in my room.I thinkthe most amazing was that I asked on dot who he was,( he always seemed to appear in my doorway, where I hang a cross) and it answered SOURCE than a few minutes later, OF, and then an few seconds later,CHRISTMAS.  You can only imagine what I thought then.I have had many more encounters with this app,and I don't know if it is real, but has kept me on my toes.",Yes
ok so I just got this app ive deleted it a few times cause I thought it was dumb but then I was in my room and it was facing my mirror and it said glass then it said stronger and stronger is the name of one of my books! get the app its awesome!,Yes
"Gosh, is this spooky? I always thought that our bus was Haunted! I took this amazing app and watched it detect 3 ghosts. One said RUN. One said LEAVE. One said GO. Wow!",Yes
"I thought I wasn't in a haunted house!,and a red dot came up!,so freaky,an I hear yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee until it STOPS!,if your under 7 don't buy it!",Yes
"when I got this app I didn't know what it did. I thought it was stupid. then I read what people said on it and then tryed it again. it then said "" fighting"" and I knew it was true. my dad and step mom where fighting for like a day or 2. I waited and waited and nothing happened. I got scared of what it would say next. so I turned it off.",Yes
"This game is fake, I know. Its really creepy, though. My mom was in the kitchen cooking and it said Tom. A few minutes later it said Help. My mom was joking around about how Tom wanted to help her cook. But then she went back to cooking and was about to pull out a pot when the radar said Pot. When I thought it couldn't be creepier, it said Cooking.Weird!",Yes
"it works. just give it time and a green,yellow,or red dot will appear(I don't know what they mean.) I would recommend this app to people who don't think this app works; I challenge you:)",Yes
"when I got this app I thought it. was fake but its not because me and my sister were running this app and we. caught a lot off ghost then we got words such as infomation,end,purpose, buldier,cade,service, green,motor,ring,death,buried,steal,share,that's,topic,helpful, dull,rising,veiw,and more butt after that her clander started moving then her curtains",Yes
"A few people in my apartment complex are getting into the whole Ghost Radar App thing. Most of them only have the Classic version. After watching videos of the Legacy edition in action I decided I'd pay the measly 99 cents for Legacy after using classic and it's worth it. You get a lot more detection out of Legacy and it logs your words so you don't have to constantly write them down like with classic. Of course if all you care about is an entertaining ghost detection app that may or may not really find ghosts, doesn't record your words, and doesn't detect nearly as many ghosts in the flox then by all means entertain yourself and your buddies with classic. I say go with legacy though if you've got the extra buck to spend on an entertaining albeit possibly fake app.",Yes
"I saw this app one day and thought it was neat to try so me and little cousin went to the cemetery and nothing happened so on the way home I suggested we go back at night, my dad overheard me and said it probably illegal. that moment the app said ""police"" we all stared at each other. then it said weather, then 5 minutes later a thunderstorm occurred I love this app",Yes
"First time I turned it on it had a bunch of readings about teriyaki, then my parents brought home teriyaki... then it said a weird word that I looked up, it ment ringing of bells, and I was ringing a bell... then I went to my friends house and she thought her house was haunted, turned it on and waited for it to get used to the house, started out ok then, it said I control we and a bunch I mean a bunch of red dots appeared, I turned it off because my friend was scared to death, then I turned it back on an hour later and it said demon and had a red dot right behind me... never using it again...",Yes
"When I first got this app, I thought that it was just something funny, yet it creeped me out when I first got it. I don't believe in ghosts, but still. Otherwise, cool app for ghost - story lovers!",Yes
"I didn't begin yet but I'm going to my school because I'm told the three lockers by me are haunted and at my singing thing,my lil sister saw what she thought was one of her closest friends relatives who said when he died, he'll watch our performance.I know it'll work.:)",Yes
"im still not sure what too think of this app. lately it seems to be more actively giving information. ill give you three examples. the other night i had it on, and i was watching a movie. i wasnt paying attention to what it was saying until it said listen. so i waited, the word kepler came up. so i googled it. there was a man, a well known lawyer who had been missing until his body was found, his name was kepler. then about ten minutes ago when i was in the bathroom it said "" henry somebody large."" i just thought i would give it a shot so i google Henry large...he also died. now im not sure yet if this constitutes as a real app to talk with ghosts. although it does frighten me a bit when it says lets play or when i tell my roommate the spirits wont talk with me and the app says ""try."" its alot better when you have two devices with the app whirring at the same time.",Yes
"While I do enjoy the Horror Genre, I do also have an interest in the paranormal.  So I figured, let me get this little novelty item for my kindle. It's kind of freaky to use late at night.  Although I won't go so far as to say it's real.  But if you want a little freaky app to kind of get you mildly jumpy/scared at night, here it is",Yes
It freaked me out when I bought it. I thought green and red dots were something eles... What are they anyway. After that my heart start racing... looking around I tried to not think of it. Someone tell me what's going on?! Freaking Scared!!!,Yes
Great for Holloween! Kinda creepy. Go on when you least expected. It's a neat little gaget to play with I thought it was worth getting.,Yes
"ok at first I thought this was fake,until I went to my dead grandfathers side of his bed and it detected something. he was my favorite person in the world,and it said ""favorite"". above the bed there is his favorite picture that was framed,and the thing said ""frame""",Yes
"It was a fun little app for a few hours. After a while, the ghosts would show up in the same spot on the radar no matter where I was eventually, so it became boring. Either the ghosts just like to follow me on my right side, or the app stopped creating random blips and got stuck in the same postition. lol Like I said, it was fun for a short time. Uninstalled it now.",Yes
"I was going to get my laundry downstairs and I was bringing my kindle with me to see if this app works. And all of the sudden the system said ""Fresh"". I ran up the stairs and thought about the voice over and over again.",Yes
we where in a civil war house and thought we would have some fun by turning on ghost radar well it was saying foriegn French gas oil death bone. after that it said select any transportation then it said names including my dads,Yes
"so when i got this app i thought. that this would be a rip off but turns out it, worked. i sleep  in a basement. the first word that i saw Was hidden and it pointed northeast so i decided to take a look when i close i heard and saw a  mouse run by it almost. scared me to death great app.",Yes
"one day I was on that radar thing and it said ""death "".I didn't worry though I thought it was fake but the. next day my grandpa died and he is only 62",Yes
"I read the reviews and thought it would be creepy but the only thing creepy is that a voice randomly says a word when you aren't expecting it to. you see a few boils on the screen and then they disappear. you can interpret anything you want from the random words. impressionable people, teenagers and children might get spooked.  best leave the door closed to this kind of stuff anyway.",Yes
Kind of creepy. Ive had this app on my kindle and I phone. I thought it was bs but I use it now and it's really as if entities are really there watching communicating,Yes
"I love this app. Me and my Nana play around with it a lot, and we both believe in ghost/spirits. One time my Nana was cleaning the house, and I turn this app on while she was vacuuming. Then a red dot appeared and the word ""Attempt"" popped up. A second later the word ""organization"" appeared. I thought about my Nana cleaning the house and that attempt organization means clean house. After that ""wherever"" popped up and I thought it was saying clean the house wherever it needs to be cleaned. I think this app is pretty cool!",Yes
"I was in the living room with my brother and I put the scanner on, I told him it was fake and just said words. the. it took forever but it said parent wich my parents were in their room. then I moved over to the other side of the living room, which is close to the window that leads to the backyard where my dog recently died and my dad buried him. I faced the kendle towards the window and a dot came up and said hurried. I freaked out and turned the kendle off. I don't know if this thing is real or not,  but I sure got freaked out. my brother thought it said fairy, but it read hurried on my screen, he does not know how to read. does anyone no what the different colored dots mean",Yes
"while ago around Midnight i had to use the bathroom, while i was in i began hearing what i thought my father in the living room and something that he may have dropped, when i came out nobody was around. i begansecurity check around the area when i notice are backdoor lock was unlocked even though i had just ""checked"" before using the bathroom minutes ago,so i started up the app an got one word out of three that surprised me ""JOE"" we have a Neighbor in are apartment by the name JOE, this paranoids me.i hope he is NOT ""astral projecting"" in are home,",Yes
"I thought it was pretty good.  It works better in the morning.  A wierd experience was it said dot then like 7 dots in a row showed up.  Last night it was stuck on ""native"".  I don't believe in ghosts anyway but I thought it would be fun!",Yes
This app is creepy. My friends and I were eating lunch and the radar was on and it said lunch. I thought it was fake so I was eating and it said good. My friends and I freaked out and I said it's fake. I got a drink and it said coke. Then it said good and choice. I think my friends and I wet our pants.,Yes
"I don't really say my house is haunted. But one night I tried it and I joked around like I thought it wasn't real. I was saying &#34;Did you fart?&#34; and &#34;You need to take a shower!&#34; But what really got me was a red dot appeared and it said STOP. I stopped talking and then I asked to show me a sign that your there. I saw my curtains move, but I did not have any fan on or air conditioner. The Windows weren't open either. I got scared for a moment and then It said SORRY. Then I said I'm not scared because I didn't want to show fear. TOPIC... SCHOOL. Then it went away. The next day I came into school and I found out that my ELA TOPIC was ghosts. Get this app... they are here with us now.",Yes
"ok, so i got this app not entirely sure what to expect, but i thought it was pretty cool. so my sister got the same app. we were sitting next to each other in my room and we both had it on. i placed my kindle fire right next to.hers, like, RIGHT NEXT TO HERS and she had all these Dolores dots everywhere.and different words showing ul and i.didn't have any colorful dots and i got different words. this proves tonne that those app DOES NOT WORK!!!!!! i hope i helped somebody in making their decision in getting this app. just because this app.doesn't work, doesn't mean i don't believe in ghosts, but this app is not real. do not get it!",Yes
"It tells me that my dads couch spot is haunted. its worth it! I recommend this app to all ghost lovers and mystery lovers! scares you a little but is F-U-N-N-Y! I got a couple of words like; ' below' and 'someone'. When I saw 'below' I thought basement, which we always thought was haunted. When it said 'someone' I looked at the window and there was a wasp trying to get in.",Yes
I was in my living room alone. All of a sudden. A dot appeared. The letters said ..m..fff. I didn't know what that meant. Then two dots appeared. One yellow. The other red with a blue dot in the middle. The letters said m..kk. So I thought they were saying mkay. I think it was my Uncle... He died of his brainal cord disconnecting. He was punched. The owner of Jumping Joeys Is a murderer. Don't trust  Jumping Joeys.,Yes
Tried it on my grandson. I thought it was actually going to work. I was wrong.,Yes
Doesn't look anything like in the pictures. Impossible to control. Would not recommend!,Yes
It wasn't real and I could not control it. Do not by . Waste of time!!!√∞??¬§ √∞??¬ê√∞??¬§,Yes
I thought it was free,Yes
"I really had fun taking my son's hand drawn home floor design and creating it in this app. It does pretty much everything I needed it to do. The amazing thing is I was able to see some flaws in my son's design that he will update in his floor plan. The app does a great job of showing the length and width of rooms and total floor space, as well as the ability to put in appliances and furniture which gives you a real perspective on the size space you need. The developer is very easy to contact by email and he is continuing to improve the app. I agree with some of the improvements suggested in other reviews, but this app does 95% of what I needed and it's free to boot. For that I give it 5 stars.",Yes
This is fun to mess with. I just wish it had more stuff like a fireplace and a way to specify built ins. I have a thing for creating floor plans. This is way more fun than drawing them on paper.,Yes
"I'm the kind of person that moves around furniture a lot. When I first started doing it I would just move things hoping they would fit. I then started using graph paper to better plan the moving. Now that I found this app this seems like this is the best thing to be doing when it comes to planning out the moving.I would have loved to give this a better rating but there are too many frustrations with this app. First of all don't turn your device portrait style or you'll get blasted with ads. Landscape doesn't seem to show ads, and that's great. My main problem with this app is that it doesn't respond the same way each time. Sometimes I want to move an object and it'll move just fine, but other times it will resize itself instead of moving, very frustrating.Things I do like about this app:-You can measure the room out and all your furniture to your exact measurements.-You can add windows, doors, closets, and ""dead space"" so you really know where you can and can't move your furniture.-You can put things at angles.-You can save your design, kinda (I'll get into more of this later).Things I don't like about this app:-The save your design thing... Sure you can save it but there's a watermark on it. If you want to save a different size or save the plan without the watermark it will cost you money.-It's not responsive the same way twice. It's very frustrating when you try to move an object an it resizes itself. Now I know how the app works and I get that when the arrows appear it will resize the item but a couple of times it would do it while I was just trying to move the item and the arrows weren't displaying. If you have a small device this would be a very frustrating app to use.-Ads in portrait mode and block a good part of the screen.-You have to zoom in and out a lot if you are working with smaller furniture.-There are no desks in the premade shapes, I just used a table instead but I thought that was odd given that they had many other things including a chair!",Yes
This tool is GREAT for my daughter who loves creating architecture!!!!! We recommend this for anyone who loves to great and especially for those creative minds!,Yes
"This is a great app I've been using to play around with how to add a new room to the house.  Controls are simple to learn and before no time I was up and running playing around with the app.  Very nice to be able to visualize what I need and want in a house design and simple enough for contractors to view what exactly I want without having to survey/re-survey the property and design from scratch.I did mention it needs more.  Over the past few weeks of using this, I noticed it needs the following:Exterior wall and interior wall widths.  Right now you can only set it for one wall thickness and the exterior walls are usually wider than the interior.  Be nice to be able to set these to different values.Needs a 'nudge' option.  Positioning with your finger (or stylus) is fine, but sometimes I need to 'nudge' it a virtual inch or two.  It would be nice if there was an option to nudge the floor in the direction needed.Landscape.  I know this is for floorplans, but the ability to place property boundaries of the house as well as simple outside things such as sidewalks, driveways and SWIMMING POOLS to be able to plan and get ideas to play around with, would really make this enjoyable.But as I mentioned, it's a good app (especially for the money) and enjoy using it.",Yes
I love moving my furniture around. This app is great as you can enter in dimensions. It is a little difficult but worth the challenge. If you can figure it all out it will be so helpful. I am having my kitchen remodeled and before they came to measure I had the whole thing mapped out on the app. I just can't say enough good things. Now that I have the actual measurements I am going to enter them all in and make modifications to their plan.,Yes
so. this app was glitchy at first. I thought it was just a thing with all apps where its a little weird at first but gets better. it did not get better. it ducks. I give it 3 stars because I was only able to tolerate one house I designed. but when I started another√¢?¬¶ it freaked out/ spazzed out. not worth my time.,Yes
"Ok, first, you ALWAYS get what you paid for. Free. So let's start there. Second, yes, of course, there are ads. I personally expected that and don't really mind. I've used the app quite a while and, for the most part just exit the ad and move on. Note, other reviewers said they tried to pay more for app without ads and were unable. Oh well.1 other review noted a limit to the number of plans. Huh? I've created about 25 with no end in sight. Another stated they had a hard time controlling room and furniture size. Room size is easy, there is a ""click"" control in the settings feature. Just turn it off. Play around with this and you'll see, it's hard to explain but it locks in certain sizes if you have it turned on and is VERY helpful if you are creating multiple variations on a floor plan on the same screen. It's EXTREMELY easy to turn off and back on this feature. As for furnishing sizes, yes, I find it frustrating too to put a small chair in my plan and, when moving it around the room, it somehow decides to increase in size and I can't decrease it. Plus, I'd like to have smaller things in the room sometimes than 2"" and nothing in the menu is less than 2"". But it's not that big a deal.In general, I really enjoy playing around with this program. I don't really understand one reviewers complaint about saving with a ""watermark"" (the only free way to save). I haven't personally found that to be a problem. My guess is? Simply that there is no privacy on a wifi type device and these free programs. Again, what do you expect? My plans aren't copyrighted but, frankly, why exactly would I care? I'm not an architect and these are just basic sketches of possible floor plans. If they were ever built, I could care less if someone ""stole"" them. One section is my idea for ""homeless"" cabins. Steel ALL you want as long as you help the homeless out. Great idea!Have fun and you will enjoy. Think it's private or professional or perfect and you will be disappointed.",Yes
"This is a great, simple way to make floor plans to give you an idea of how you would like walls placed.  We are interested in creating living space in our basement and this is coming in very handy for that.",Yes
"I want to move some things around in the upstairs level of my home. Trying to figure out a good way to have to scale rooms and objects to manipulate would be a challenge on paper and since this isn't something for a commercial need, I didn't want to invest in some expensive software I can't easily figure out.  This app does the trick wonderfully!  I was able to take measurements of my rooms and easily create appropriate sized rooms ad shapes with the app. Then, I moved them around to see what I could arrange where and this will afford me the ability not only to rearrange but add some things from other areas of the house where I didn't really want them (like the rower in my living room)!  The app has the ability to survey your room to some extent with your camera, but I found the creation tool to be plenty easy and intuitive, so I didn't even attempt that.  The main things I could see improvements on are objects and layers. I'd like some things to sit behind others and I don't think that's possible with the ones I'm working with right now. The size restrictions on certain things is tough too. Like my platform bed has an edge around it and the app would not let me increase to the size I need, so I had to add on a rectangle to properly depict the size.  It would be nice for more object or custom ones that have general shapes or a polygon tool to set up a certain #of side and define their lengths.",Yes
"Overall, a good app.  A little hard to control dimensions, especially down to 1/4 inch.",Yes
Doesn't work how I thought it would,Yes
"This does exactly what you want if that is total freedom to design your own floor plan from scratch. So much less limiting than other so-called floor plan apps which pre-determine elements for you. I have this on my Kindle Fire and Samsung Galaxy tab 3. I spent too much time trying to figure out how to update my Kindle's version (lots of improvements since then) before I thought to look up the app from the Kindle app store. That's when I saw the update button, where it would usually say ""install."" It would make sense for there to be an update option in the actual app. Love the new menu options.  Things I would love to see: 1. Better chair choices. The small chair now gets longer to make a bench, but not deeper. The sofa can shrink also, but again, only lengthwise; not enough to qualify as a desk chair, especially with those fat arms. So, maybe a mid-sized chair?  2. It drives me crazy to keep trying to layer menu items, such as an upper cabinet over a lower, or a lamp over a table, only to have them reverse positions. Thanks for the fun app!",Yes
Hard to control on Kindle HDX .  May be better on computer,Yes
Wasn't what I thought it was.,Yes
"It really wasn't all that great. I thought it could have had better layouts, and it was a bit confusing.",Yes
Not as easy to use as I thought. I may end up deleting it.,Yes
"This app is really great for creating rooms. I would give this 5 stars if they had more furniture, like bookshelves or things for a backyard. Great app though!",Yes
"I installed this on my DroidX.  Forget it.  To small to create with finger control.  Maybe better on a 8 or 10"" tablet?",Yes
"This app is really cool. But you need youtube player to watch the tutorial video. It takes time to figure out how to do things. It's really fun  though. Creating walls and furniture and new rooms, it's addicting.",Yes
Have not tried this app just yet but still have it on my kindle.  I am sure it won't be exactly as I thought it to be but sure it will be interesting none the less.,Yes
Basic program works as I thought it would and seems like it will be a helpful tool for my home work.,Yes
"Downloaded the app, went straight to designing a floor plan of our home and within 15 minutes had produced exactly that.For a free app this is very good, I will after further use, seriously consider purchasing and supporting the developers.Whilst I am no Cad technician I do have very basic understanding of cad systems which may be why it was so easy to pick up and use out of the box, but I am sure a layman after following the instructions and an hour having a hands on work out will find it very easy and will find many uses when planning home DIY...... I plan on using it to plot cad variations/discrepancies in my job as a shop fit project manger for a well known world wide retailer, should I be caught off duty without the usual tablet/laptop.Great Work",Yes
"Excellent application - we have been using it to draw up a floor plan in preparation for selling our house, and the integration with our Bosch PLC laser distance meter is really good. Draw a rough outline with all the bits of nooky-cranny wall you've got in a room, tell it to measure, and it shows an outline for each wall to measure, you use the laser meter to do the readings and it adjusts the floor plan of that room for you. Super easy, well put together.A small gripe is the stairs. It is difficult to see on the plans whether a set of stairs are emerging from the floor underneath, or going up to the level above. Be very useful to be able to mark this in some way (i know there are conventions for doing this on floor plans with estate agents and whatnot, and while i realise that be different in the 3D mode, being able to mark this somehow on the 2D plan other than just adding a label would be good).As a suggestion for improvement: Being able to select a bunch of bits and creating a new level out of them would be very useful (as well as selecting multiple bits and moving them around). Ran into this because i was a silly person who made the entire plan on one level before realising that wasn't possible, which turned what i thought would be convenient into something that was less so ;) My fault for not checking, but i think it'd be useful anyway.And a useful actually-new-feature for our purpose specifically: Being able to do ground plans, not just floor plans. We have an unusual layout outside our house, which i wanted to draw a plan of as well, but this app only does internal layouts. As it is called ""Floor Plan Creator"" though, it is understandable that an arguably tangential feature like something that is outside of a house isn't included, but again, thought it might be good for the author to know the desire for the feature exists :)",Yes
"Too basic, I want more printed controls.",Yes
I choose this APP for my Kindle because I thought it would work for my application to print emails and other info from the WEB.This APP would not work on my PRINTER. We have a HP WIRELESS Printer. Model did not show up under printer types. I tried to print to my  I.P. address  and HPEPRINT but would not print. This APP might work for some other printer. This is why my STAR rating was a 3. This might work with a number but not ours Thanks.,Yes
"Thought it was going to work when it found my Brother printer, but it never connected to it.  It didn't list my model.  I tried other Brother models but still did not connect. (MFC-490CW) ?  Evidently works for others, just not for me.  Deleting",Yes
Thought it would be a good idea to print from my Kindle when I sitting down browsing.  I reality I have used it once so OK I suppose.,Yes
"Only just bought it but so far so good, sets up very easy and looks good although not as small as i thought it would be.",Yes
"Set up easily or so I thought, it confidently told me that my document was printing and then that my document was successfully printed...no it wasn't... Nothing actually happened tried a number of different settings but no joy, so could only give it one star for the ease of set up for a Kodak printer.  But disappointed for its failure to work, will be uninstalling.",Yes
"I started off with the free app of this and upgraded to the paid version (which is a great price!).  It enables listening and talking.The App works great.  I have a couple of Foscam wireless webcams and this program works great.  Can easily view, move, listen, talk to the camera.Overall, it's a bargain for the price, because the Foscam web interface is poorly designed.The only hiccup I've found is that if you don't ""Back"" out of the program to close it on the Kindle (press back button to close rather than just pressing Home button) it may keep running.  I've had my kindle cover closed and the Kindle off (so I thought) and heard sound coming from it which was this App still monitoring a room.  This will then run down your battery.",Yes
"I was pleasantly surprised how good this free version is.  I can point the camera by tilting my kindle fire the same way I would do if I were tilting my head.  Have to invert controls to do it, which is an easy setting to change.  Load multiple cameras on one screen.  I couldn't get the manufacturers software to work on my phone (foscam on evo 4g), but this does!",Yes
"Quick and easy installation on my Motorola Android phones and my Airpad. Gives me great control over my HooToo IPCam Plus other IPCams. It's easy to add cameras and you can always upgrade for additional features. My only con is not being able to delete a single camera, it's all or nothing. Tiny Solutions LLC have done a great job on this app. I will probably purchase the pro version in order to get the full audio package but if you're only interested in video this is the app for you.",Yes
"Pro:I can display several cameras at once and see a realtime display from them all at the same time, something my stock camera app won't do.Con:Among others, I have 2 Wyze cameras.  I have 1 fixed camera and 1 camera with pan/tilt/zoom (PTZ).  App constantly confuses which is which, resulting in my loss of ability to control the pan/tilt of the camera with PTZ because the app thinks that is the fixed one.  I've removed and re-added the cameras multiple times in different orders to try and fix this, but it keeps happening.",Yes
"I wish that I had some navigation controlling when I touch the radio button.  It seems to just do it thing.  The old tiny camera, I was able to control the navigating of the video camera when I want to view the room.",Yes
Have tried several Foscam viewers and non have worked on the G5 over https. Only reason for 4 stars is that can not control pan and tilt. Have a F19821w with 2.1 firmware. Great app,Yes
This is a great application for controlling my Foscam FI8910W camera.  I liked the features in this free version so much that I upgraded to the Pro version!Highly recommend!,Yes
"Very easy and just what I need to watch my dogs when I'm traveling.  You can watch up to 14 cameras at once, I only have 3.  I can control the cameras, zoom in, pan, etc",Yes
Downloaded for use with WyzeCam and it added stability to a problematic camera. It does much more that I don't use.,Yes
Got this to try out with the newsecurity camera.  Ended up getting the pro version because it worked well as a trial.,Yes
"Very useful app for getting a handle on one or moresecurity cameras. I'd give it 5 stars but it can be a bit complicated to get everything working right. Very specific in what it needs in the way of information, but it does not give very clear instructions on just how to do it. Seems to be more of an intermediate skill set tool than beginner. I did, however, figure it out through trial and error. Fortunately, after you set one camera up, you are good to go from then on, knowledge wise.",Yes
The Free tinyCam Monitor works great with my Foscam FI8910W units.  The performance is similar to the Foscam Monitor Android app for multi-camera operation. TinyCam does not allow speaker or microphone operation or pan/tilt control.  But that may be a feature of the paid version.  It works with dynamic DNS for Internet access as well.  If you set your units up this way be sure to change your units default user Id's and pass-codes.,Yes
Free version has the overall features to see your cams from Intranet (at home network) and Internet. Proversion has more controls if some of your cams need adjustment or repositioning.,Yes
bought it for my 10 year old daughter. she loves it. she recommends it to any one around her age. she even thought she saw a ghost or a figure in one cam.,Yes
This app did not work on my Kindle. I put insecurity cameras and I am not able to view.,Yes
Homesecurity,Yes
"after trying 10 different softwares to control webcams, this is the number 2 in the Hit Parade (after IP Cam Viewer) for these reasons :easy to use, user-friendly interface, quick response, my 12 cameras are displayed at the same time without useless infos on my Samsung Galaxy phones(S3,S4,S5)??(Tab1,Tab2,Tab3; 7"",10""), almost all control commands are available and functioning perfectly.",Yes
Works well to view my Foscam IP camera- however no pan or tilt controls are available.,Yes
"I used the help line for instalation. They were helpful. 2 days later the lens foged up after a rain storm. I was able to fix, but told help line that I didn't feel confident reinstalling. They asked if I wanted refund or replacement. I am happy with camera and asked for replacement. This happened 2 days ago and waiting for replacment.  This transaction is through mfg. Not Amazon",Yes
if u r looking for something to manage ur cameras this is it.  Have two businesses 40 miles apart this app keeps me informed.  Great controls feature rich.,Yes
"I have used this app for a long time.  It keeps improving.  So many features.  Also get. "" IP Camera"" app.  Then use your old cell phones assecurity cameras monitored by Tiny Cam.  Seriously buy his app.  It works.",Yes
"this app is excellent. It does control my 3 Foscam cameras. It also controls an old Android phone camera I have set up. It does control pan and tilt functions. you can view and control your cameras from your Android phone or tablet from a remote location,either using wifi or 4g. To do this, you must use the external IP address of your router. You can also view your cameras from your own internal network while you are at home connected to your own WiFi network. The individuals who claim they cannot view their cameras from their phone do not understand how to set up external and internal IP cameras.",Yes
"Hello, can you add a function to get the sound of a camera mode multicamera please.On my iPad, LiveCamsPro application has this feature and I would like to have it on my android tablet too.Is it also possible to not automatically hide a status bar on the tablet, thank you.Thank you in advance.",Yes
"how am i supposed to know if this app really works on a kindle fire? obviously it did not come with a camera on it, and I thought that I could hat an app that could work as a camera? please respond and give your feedback if you know of any other app.",Yes
Although I am late in writing this review I have to say even though the quality for a small screen is very good. The trouble that we have been having to this day is that we have only ever been able to rig up one camara. And the camara that we have got up and running doesnt record or payback but as we only use it as a livesecurity it fine for us. But if we would wanted to record anything we wouldn't be able to,Yes
Thought this would let me mirror my Fire HD to my Firestick.Not understanding why this has to be so difficult.Or am I missing something?,Yes
"Installed an uninstalled o.k. I don't like that I can't review after I've uninstalled (Amazon please fix that). First screen was an ad for Facebook, x'ing out of that brought me to a screen to check my wireless connection, connection was verified after hitting start but closing the wireless information screen brought me back to the page asking me to hit start. No further action is possible.  Worthless for the Kindle Fire until they fix that.",Yes
"It wasn't what I thought it would be ,my husband has sight problems but it did not help.",Yes
"I wanted to like this channel...  loved the theory behind it.... and my dogs seem to watch √¢??human√¢?¬ù TV while we are watching so I thought it would be a success... but the performance of this channel/app was so frustrating. The latency was more than my patience could handle. I would stand there for 5 minutes waiting for it to load so that I could select the right option within the channel... when I√¢??m running out the door for work, I don√¢??t want to wait 5 minutes to turn on the TV for my dogs. Clean up the performance, Dog TV. Note: we have a new smart TV and do not have latency issues with ANY other app/channel we use. This IS a DogTV issue and we cancelled our subscription",Yes
"I have a 10 month old Siberian Husky who already enjoys watching TV whether it's Animal Planet, National Geographic Wild or even a football game. In the right mood, she will watch any TV program, especially one featuring animals or dogs with a surprising amount of focus. We downloaded this app at about 2:30am on our Fire TV and woke her up from a pretty deep sleep just to see if it interested her. She watched for about 15 minutes straight until we made her go upstairs for bed (and turned it on up there).A lot of the negative reviews tend be from people's who's dog didn't care too much or that were having issues with the stream a couple years ago. From the hour or so we've had it on it works perfectly fine and offers on demand selections as well as live programming that fits the time of day. My dog personally couldn't take her eyes off thestimulation video and relaxation video we played when we first got it. The content certainly seems dog orientated which is neat. Lots of dogs eye view of everyday life, various dog clips, and relaxing scenery. I won't lie though, the overnight program is trippy but I guess if it works for dogs, it works. Certainly not made for human enjoyment though to be honest, I find it very interesting and find myself watching just to see what's next.If your dog already likes watching TV, they should like this. If not, they may not. But the service is what it is so I wouldn't be discouraged by the people leaving one star reviews just because their dog didn't care for it or because they thought a channel scientifically designed for dogs would interest them too.",Yes
"I started to leave this on for my dog during the day while I'm at work as an experiment. When I come home she seems a lot more relaxed. This channel plays videos of dogs sleeping, playing, etc. And pairs them with familiar noises and nature sounds (squeak toys, happy voices, wind chimes, leaves falling, ocean waves) I don't know if I'm crazy but it seems to really work!",Yes
I reviewed the free clips however none seemed to be what your dog would see if you subscribed-  per descriptions /examples of color- sound- etc. meant for the dogs viewing time.I had my dog with me & tried to interest her-  (she√¢??s 1 year Shepard mix - intelligent & curious by nature√¢??-)  the free clips did not stir her interest in the least.  I couldn√¢??t get her to do more than glance at it-  then look away-I played them several times hoping she√¢??s engage but no interest.Perhaps because these are the clips meant for humans-  not dogs.I Recco allowing a couple short clips meant for the dogs viewing-  as I surely won√¢??t purchase based on our experience so far.Neat idea-  but nothing there to see what our best friend thinks about it in fairness.,Yes
"I wanted to like this service.  But it was glitchy, hard to understand the app to get it to work.  Multiple clicks to try to get the sections to activate.  I√¢??m no slouch to understanding the works of most apps and services, but this one was pretty bad and unresponsive.  Maybe I should have asked my Border Collie.  I cancelled the service.  Maybe when they get their app working properly I might try again.",Yes
"Our dog loves Dog TV but it stops and buffers all the time and if you are not there with the remote to start it, then it's no use.  If we leave it on when we have to leave our dog home alone, we can check oursecurity camera and it is always stopped within 10 or 15 minutes of us leaving.  It's not our internet since it doesn't do that when we watch a movie or binge watch a show.  Dog TV needs to fix the problem  or we will cancel.",Yes
"My dog and I like the app. I even purchased an annual subscription. The problem is that it only plays a few minutes at a time before crashing. I've cleared the cache, I've cleared the data, I've uninstalled and reinstalled, I've signed out and back in, and I've done every combination of the above. Nothing works. Fix the stability and I will gladly change my rating.*updated review - - They fixed it.",Yes
"At first I thought this was a great idea and my dog seemed to actually watch it. She wasn't one to ever notice the TV, so I thought this was going to be great. I put it on two TVs when I went to work and every time I wold peak in on the cameras she was in a different room looking out the window.I definitely think it is made for them and grabs their attention, I guess my dog just prefers to wait for the mailman or Amazon man rather than watch TV.",Yes
"What I thought would be a great idea to keep my pooch company, turns out my dog is terrified by the images on DOGTV and despite my written attempts to cancel, they keep billing. I even get billed TWO TIMES EVERY MONTH because I accidentally clicked the purchase button twice. I am beyond frustrated and only now realized there√¢??s this review function. It might be good for somebody√¢??s pet, but not mine. All I√¢??ve received is acknowledgement of my request, no follow through. I don√¢??t have $20 each month to throw away as I√¢??ve never turned DOGTV on after the first day. Bummer.",Yes
"I thought it would be a free channel so my dogs would feel comfortable when we leave to go someplace.  I didn√¢??t think it was worth it, I did even get a sample of what to expect.",Yes
My dogs enjoy watching and/or listening to Dog TV.  I put on their channel whenever I leave them home alone.  We also watch it together to get away from regular tv and all the conflict in the world these days.  I find it quite relaxing!  The Dog TV Challenge gave me interesting tips on getting my dogs to be more engaged in their programming.,Yes
"......I thought they were free, but you must pay for this service.......My dog could watch hours of free dog  videos on ""You Tube "" for free.",Yes
Terrible. Paid for a one month subscription and cancelled. Extremely limited content.- I honestly thought this could not possibly be the content.  My dog was not the least bit interested and the repetitive music just annoyed me. Absolutely not worth the subscription fee.,Yes
My dog enjoys the distraction of pleasant sounds featuring dogs & children while I am work during the day.,Yes
"I thought this was supposed to be free with Amazon Prime not just 30 days free.  They then start billing after the first few days.  This gets annoying, I thought I'd try one again to see if it's gotten any better but sadly, it hasn't.  Too bad because it looked like something pretty cool.  I don't understand why Prime is supposed to have  free stuff for it's members yet it charges monthly fees for everything.",Yes
Thought be fun to put it on for my dog as some of my friend said their dogs enjoyed it ..... He was not interested.,Yes
"Not exactly what I thought it would be, I was hoping for more ""shows"" for dogs and longer than 30 minute shows or music, especially for the separation anxiety, my dogs didn't really care too much for it. But I enjoyed the music to sleep too lol!",Yes
"My dogs weren√¢??t thrilled with it but it is soothing to watch, well, I thought so lol",Yes
"Damn if I can ever get this working, I have added it to cable and to my Firestick. I work in IT support, I pity the person that is ""tech challenged"" and dare attempts to make this consistently work. The few times it did, it seemed like a so-so product.",Yes
I thought it would at least offer some free options. Nope. It's too expensive and I have no problem usually dropping some coin for my girl.,Yes
The videos are centered more around tranquility. I would like to see more action. My puppy wants to play.I bought the app so my dogs would be entertained while I work from home. I can√¢??t be playing while I need to work. I√¢??m not convinced it√¢??s worth $9.99 a month yet.,Yes
I thought it was free but it's not.,Yes
Thought it was a channel FOR dogs.  Wasn't interesting for dog parent either.,Yes
I thought this was a joke but it wasn't couldn't believe it.,Yes
"I thought the app was free, but there is a monthly fee",Yes
"Dogs LOVE it. However ... have been experiencing ""playback error"" for the past week-ish. Defeats the purpose of all day distraction. Sofa paid the price.",Yes
I enjoyed it but my girl Gracie didn't take to it. I tried to get her to sit with me but she had a ear infection and really didn't like it when I would flush em and I think she thought that I would try to flush,Yes
"This is absurd, but I wish I√¢??d thought of it so I could charge humans for this nonsense. Zero intention of actually subscribing. My dog rolled his eyes and went back to licking and watching stuff that was free.",Yes
Was pleasantly surprised when i came across this app and thought it would be great for our pups while we're away.  Then i needed to pay to activate it.  Why would i pay a monthly subscription for this to be a baby(dog)sitter.  Nuts!!!!  I just deleted the app and moved on.,Yes
A sorry excuse for an app. Very limited programming  and my dogs  showed no interest in watching it and no reaction to listening to it.,Yes
Thought it would be a good idea it made my dog anxious.,Yes
Dog did not like. No action just colors and sound,Yes
"My dog LOVES DogTV. I thought there was no way a dog would watch TV, but sometimes when he√¢??s a little rambunctious at home, I turn it on. He sits and watches it!",Yes
Just videos of dogs.... not at all what I thought it would be q complete waste of my time would definitely never pay for it,Yes
I thought it was free.,Yes
Didn√¢??t like it wasn√¢??t what I thought it would be.,Yes
There was only like 3 minutes worth of free programming and it was just previews of the regular programming. And some videos about dog adoption. Everything else comes with the $9.99 monthly fee. I thought it would have lots of programs for dogs but it would been nice to know how limiting it was before downloading.,Yes
Hated the trial trick.  You only get am extremely short trial loop. Everything else paid for by a micro transaction process. A waste of time.,Yes
I thought it was free!  In any case too expensive ...,Yes
"When I try to log in, I continuously receive an error message. I√¢??ve tried creating a new account and changing my password. I am able to access the app from my iPhone, but have problems streaming from my TV. The support at Dog TV was wholly inadequate.",Yes
"Thought this would be free that why I downloaded it. Not something I'm going to pay for I'm afraid,so didn't start watching it.",Yes
"As reported previously, no audioNot a problem if you have a Bluetooth speakerHowever, as also reported, the video lags, creating image distortion and audio lag which is not a problem for short videos but would be hell if trying to view a movie or other lengthy videoOverall, mehIt did what I wanted",Yes
"had  trouble getting the sound to go though  the sound bar (could not get sound thought the sound bar)could not get picture on the tv to be fulll screen on the 65"" tv",Yes
This didn't do what I thought it would and I uninstalled it about 3 hours after I purchased it.  Merp!,Yes
I am unhappy with this as I was charged today. I thought there was no charge and it was on 0.00 at the time.,Yes
"My daughter downloaded this.. I have had zero interactions with it, other than writing this review, which I felt compelled to write.",Yes
This product is not what I expected. I thought it would work like cast but it does not,Yes
No what i thought it was!,Yes
Trying to mirror iPad to TV via Fire Stick. Thought this would be the answer but records screen and Apple TV doesn't allow videos to be played with screen being recorded. 7 quid wasted!,Yes
Although it works it√¢??s not as useful as I thought it would be. Limited uses in reality.,Yes
"I was unable to figure out how to use, I think I will not use this app .",Yes
Fun way to connect with my granddaughter. And I was unable to figure out how to use. I am sad for it .,Yes
Awesomesauce when you have wifi but not working on data . And also I was unable to figure out how to use. ,Yes
I don√ït like this app  . not easy to use.I was unable to make the simplest edit to my PDF,Yes
Useless. I was unable to make the simplest edit to my PDF. Wish I could get my money back but Amazon makes it impossible.,Yes
don√ït like this type of app. Run out of calls quick and its impossible to get more without paying,Yes
this is bothering me.i cant make a call on wifi.Also I wish only needed Wi-Fi to call not text.,Yes
weasting my time .I wish you could call any amount of times without watching any adds. Also  I wish only needed Wi-Fi to call not text.,Yes
"downloaded and deleted because I faces problem in the dificult  layout. And also I got problem like this "" invalid file when trying to open"". Can you please fix this. Bothering me bro",Yes
They are big liars and stink.Every time I tried to open it it would crash then tell me an unknown error occurred,Yes
All worked well as advertised,No
It works well,No
Great app,No
Maybe itís my internet but it lags on me,No
Needs to work with android,No
"I couldn't give this 5-stars, because as I was signing in to use the FREE app, it suggested I pay $1.99 for pro.  Since the program  I wanted to watch and send from my phone to my TV was about to start, I had no chance to read the difference between Pro and Free, so I went with Pro.  I had paid for an online event, so the extra $1.99 to make sure it would work was worth it, but I do wonder if Free would have been just as effective.",No
"Fine on small files, hangs on large.Won't load several 250 MB magazines which Adobe, which is not it's bloated, useless self on Android, and EZPDF Reader handle with ease.Android 4.4.3 on B & N HD+. Samsung Galaxy 2, Android 4.4.4.Loaded with all sorts of very nice features, but it fails at the most basic task; reading PDF's.Perhaps this app has too much max and not enough basic functionality or perhaps 280 MB of available RAM is not enough to load a 250 MB file.Whatever the case, this app does not work with large files (Consumer Reports, etc).Got this free here on the FAOTD",No
"Opens .pdf documents way faster than the Adobe app, and more functional as well. This is a must have app if you deal with .pdf documents at all. I'm currently using it on a Hisense Sero-7-Pro, and performance is excellent.EDIT: Update to report one problem I have found. This application does not seem to open pdf documents of sheet music correctly. Had similar issues with other apps as well (Adobe app works). Other than that I am still happy with the performance of this app.",No
"I like a lot of the features. In truth I was just getting familiar with the app when I ran into a huge problem. It won't run without internet access. Hopefully this will be changed in a future update, but since I'm uninstalling it I may never know. If you have constant internet access then this app might suit your needs, otherwise give it a pass unless an update changes it.",No
downloaded and deleted,No
I think it is cool but I can't get more credits it keeps on telling me come back later I do and no nothing but other then that it is cool,No
It's AWESOME,No
"I liked it, though it was kinda confusing for me at least. I thought it was really cool, and I think you guys should try it. and if you don't like it then that's just your opinion and this is mine so.....listen to me if you want but you don't have too.:)",No

"Awesome app but sorta hard to use, u see I have 2 Mayas when there's only supposed to be 1. Long story. Don't ask.",No
Yes the kindle tablet is by far the best tablet to own,No
I've been using this app to text on a Kindle Fire for several months with no major issues. Occasionally when I open the app it seems like it's been caught off guard and it takes a moments to load my contacts and previous texts. None of my contacts or  texts have been lost.I have not used the app to make calls.,No
"My daughter put this app on her 6"" Kindle Fire HD and she loves it because it gives her a phone number of her own and she can text anyone with a cellphone but she can also call any phone number too!",No

I love this app,No

It is one of the best PDF app available into he market. But the app demands mm ore than 200 MB of ram and make device slow. Make the device less ram hungry and it will be on my top lost.,No
Excelente.,No
"I have tried a few different PDF readers, and I believe that this one is superior. The documents load quickly and easily. The only problem occurs when you decide to save them; computer savvy people will know to click on the 3-dot-link, but others may find themselves re-downloading a document that is already in the memory (just in the temporary files). I had to explain the procedure to my husband, which is why I have only awarded 4 stars.",No

This is a must have for anyone that works on their phone.,No
Seems to work nicely. I'm glad the kindle has so many options.,No
"I got this app as an FAOTD and use it mainly to annotate PDFs. It has so many features, including signing PDFs, that I uninstalled Adobe Acrobat to make this my main PDF app. I love that I can have multiple PDFs open, they open immediately, and the annotation options are customizable. Deleting annotations is also easy.Two things I don't like:* I can't edit files on my external card. (Hopefully this changes in Lollipop.)* I keep getting a blank notification that doesn't go away until I open the program, and there are no notifications setting controls. I'm hoping it was just pestering me to rate and will now go away permanently.",No

I am really enjoying this app. I am glad to have discovered this app because it is very useful to me. I read PDF's quite often and this app helps me out a lot.,No
Just starting out with this app shows much promise.  The capabilities are useful and the lack of permissions is even thoughtful. I'm quite pleased so far and it appears to be well worth the purchase price.,No
"Awesome app for editing pdf's in a note-taking fashion. So far it handles large pdf's with lots of pictures and backgrounds better than Repligo Reader, something I've been needing for a few years.The single feature I would love to see is cloud storage support (dropbox, drive, etc.). There's a whole star waiting to be filled when that becomes available. :-)",No

I like my kindle!,No
It's alright,No
This app is really useful and comes in handy often. I am living it so far. The only tweak I would say could use improving....is to make it to where your message tone and call tone are different.  But that isn't a huge loss. Thanks guys for this awesome app.,No
This app is pretty cool because you can call and text to other tablets or to other phones. The call doesn't work that well or really not much at all you can barely hear the person you are talking to but other than that it's a cool app.,No
seems to work well. A few ads but not too many.,No

Thi app worked well,No
It's alright. I would wish to name the contacts I have.,No
"I absolutely love this app! It doesn't slow down my kindle, it runs smoothly, and (the best part) I can now call and text FOR FREE. I gave the app only four stars, however, for two reasons. 1. There are ads. This isn't all bad, but they are distracting, and I live in constant fear that I'll accidentally tap one and I'll be redirected somewhere else. 2. Although texting is completely and utterly free, calling requires ""credits"". You earn credits by watching and rewatching the 15 second ad videos over and OVER again (each time, earning only one or two credits), or you can play a small free game and/or submit your email and subscribe to some website and earn more credits that way. But, another plus: unlike Skype and other such apps, the person you hope to text does NOT need an account also. You can simply type in their phone number, and from there you can text and call. Likewise, a person can call you with the free phone number that TextMe gives you when you get the app. Overall, I would definitely recommend this app!!!",No

Only four stars because the storyline seems to call for more than just match three. But it's a nice game.,No
"It's a fun match 3 game with side games that add to the bonuses you can get, but beware the high cost of trying to compete in some of them! Energy actually doesn't too long to restore but some levels can be difficult & you can blow thru energy in no time. If you simply play for yourself & don't mind using in-game resources to buy bonuses, you can enjoy this game. You can advance without spending real life money.",No

Also, the loading times for levels are terrible.",No
Lot's of fun,No
Enjoying the games,No
"Fun little game to pass the time!  It takes the ever popular 'match 3' game style and gives more strategy and purpose.  Reminds me a lot of Gummy Drop if your familiar with that game,, just has a different scene and scenario.  I enjoy it, and if you give it a shot you probably will too.  The only set back, as with most of these in app purchasing games, is you can only get so far until you either have to be patient and wait for energy to replenish over time, or spend your cash on the green gems.  I don't think so...lol...I'll wait. Fun. Check it out!",No
"Awesome game, keeps you thinking.",No

This game is fun.,No
"I was fascinated with this game, I couldn't stop playing.  Well now it seems you have to play the same game over and over and over just to get a trinket that you hardly get so you can move on to build the town.  Life is too short to be mesmerized in a game that wants to suck you in to spend money.  I think I will take a walk!",No

"Very addictive. I love puzzle games, and connect three games. The graphics are very attractive as well.",No
Different take on match 3 - fun!,No
It's enjoyable. Still trying to figure out what you need to do to advance.  I've played it at least once every day.,No

"I like this game, but wish it would get right to the next level sometimes.  Less talk more game, hehe.",No
Best free match 3 game I've played. You can play about 10 rounds every morning after power level rebuilds overnight. Takes about 30 minutes of downtime to earn another level of play. Just enough as to let you actually have a life away from the game.,No

"Fun, though still chock-full of micro transactions.",No
Fun puzzles,No
Fun game easy to learn.,No
"This is a cute game. It's like they put a couple of games that are similar to very popular games like candy crush and a popular game that u complete quests(idk a name off hand) together into one. So if ur bored this can waste a lot of time, until u run out of energy. I very much dislike games that have the energy thing. I will play them for a few days until it gets to where I can't play it but for a few minutes because my energy is gone. I then I delete it. So that's why I gave 3 stars. Get rid of that ridiculous energy stuff so we can play for however long we want, please! Then u will get 5 stars.",No

Keeps me entertained.,No
I like it a lot so far thank you,No
Agreed. Game is slow but that's because energy is very low and takes forever to upgrade. Like the fact that you don't have to start each level off at the beginning of you fail to get 3 stars. Not sure about building collections. Previous experience in other games with collection-building proved to be too frustrating and I quit the games. Like city-building though so will see how it goes.,No

This game is so funny. My dad got mad at the tablet for the age it gave him. This isn't really and it won't now who u are so don't freak.lol.,No
It is awesome. I love it.,No
This app is so funny it's not like any other scanners it's different. You can prank your friends by writing something in the box.,No
it keeps saying I'm in the forty's or twenty or sixteen it is really funny and I am only 9 years old and this was in may 2014,No

"I really enjoy it‚Ä¶, so does my family.Bit the thing people don't understand is it's NOT suppose to be real results it's fun so SHUTUP AND ENJOY IT!!!!!!",No
This is a very fun app to play with friends and family.  The funniest part is when adults use it the age is younger and when kids use it the age is higher I guess because adults want to be younger and kids want to be older. So I really hope ever one would get this app because it is fun to use even though it doesn't tell the truth I s still fun to play as y. My family enjoyed it so much .  Mostly when we prank our family members to tell th e truth about there age and we do this as to them and laugh as o hard when it says your 48 or something. So I really hope you get this app. And I hope this was helpful.:D,No
AWESOME!!,No
It's really funny. I'm 10 and it said I was 55. My grandma scanned her finger and was 23. She was younger than me!!!!!!!,No
You can prank your friends and it's really fun!üòùüòùüòùüòùüòùüòùüíôüíô,No
It guesses your age. completely random. I am 11 and it said I'm 49.,No

I lüíñve it,No
Love it,No
i love this one. it is just like the wieght scanner but better i think its more intertaining to my guest.,No
This app is very funny it usually say the wrong age but it's funny. You should try it out for yourself though.,No
"It really doesn't accurately read your age.  It can be way off, but sometimes it's right. It's just a silly game that makes people laugh.",No
This app is fun and is cool to use ... But the youngest age you can have is 19 so its not all that realistic.,No
obviously this is just for entertainment purposes. I personally think it is an interesting app. Not something I'd use every day but definetely fun to use on new people.,No
"hahaha I'm 67 years now! ew ... lol, its a fun game to play. especailly when you have a 3 year old relative and she's 50 :P",No

Works,No
This is the best app ever.  I was up at 3:00 and there were ghost every where.  It was so fun when I have this app.  It changed every thing it was the funniest thing when I scared somebody.  It was really fun to.  It had dots every where.  If you don't have this app you should get it.  If you don't believe in ghosts you will after you get this app.,No
"I tried out this app and as soon as I turned it on, tha radar started goin CRAZY. I then walked around my house and found tha most activity going on in my bathroom. I then saw a ghost taking a sh*t on my toilet!!!! This is tha real deal",No
cool app,No
"Enjoyed the app! A huge hit amongst friends and family. Terrified some people. Rather you believe or not, it's as fun as saying ""Bloody Mary"" in front of the mirror with friends! Perfect for people who aren't too paranoid (or for people who are friends or family members of those who scare easy!)",No
Pretty dag on scary! We have become amateur ghost hunters! If you are interested in ghost hunting you have to try it!,No
Fun app. Almost started believing it.,No
Would be nice if there were a little more to it.,No
"When I first started using it, I was sceptical. One of the first words was "" Chicago "", then ""James"", and factory. My Dad, James, lived in Chicago and welded in a factory. One night, my son called me to come and pick him up. This was unexpected. When I got back home, I turned it on. The words were, son, telephone, pick up. Now, you tell me!",No
People r saying that this app is stupid and fake but they r wrong wrong wrong wrong this works cuz I pour it up to my dogs ashs and the yellow dot showed up yellow means family or friends any way it said Abby the name of the dog this is the coolest app if you  dont like this app u r crazy,No
Fun but I wouldn't count on this as reality.  LOL,No
"I have used this app for over a year.  It has entertained me, my kids, my friends, my wife, my co-workers and so on.  I am a believer in ghosts, but a severe skeptic of this app.  Every now and then it'll creep you out by spouting relevant words and dots in relevant locations, but at least 75% of it appears to be random or void of energy spikes.  Anyone who takes this app too seriously is gullible and anyone who dismisses it completely is joyless.  It delivers fun and entertainment to believers and skeptics alike and should be used solely for entertainment.",No
"I stumbled upon this app and I just had to try it! I'm like obsessed with these ghost paranormal things! I got it and after two days I got it these words popped up on the screen like, ""these"" ""leaf"" ""happened"" and ""vapor"" I was not sure what it meant cuz it didn't make sense and after the word vapor appeared I heard this loud crash from my storm door!  CREEPY!  If u r really interested in paranormal stuff like me u should TOTALLY get this app!",No
To many ghost in my mom and dad's bedroom,No
"When i first got this app, i was a little skeptical about it but tried it anyway cuz im 13 like what 13 yr old wouldn't get this?! XD so anyways i was changing in my laundry room with this app on and the word appeared ""change"" i freaked out and told my parents but they wer just laughing at me, it's real like 80% of the time i recommend trying it out it's pretty cool!!! :D",No
"I got this app for pure fun. I was sitting in my bed and watching it. Then the words, &#34;burn, women, and visitor&#34; popped up. It was soooo scary because in the late 18 hundreds, 2 women died in the bedroom from a house fire. Visitor is scary, is because I am visiting the house for a while till my family gets a house of our own.  This app seriously scared we to death.",No
I like this a lot and is fun to play with.  I go with others to investigate possible paranormal activity and have used the Ghost Radar as added evidence to back up other equipment responses.,No
I stared this app up and dots appeared then it said the word GERMAN. I am from a German heritage so I think it pretty creepy that this app said that. Download this app it is very entertaining. PS you must turn on LBS for this app to work. ---NMS---,No
"I really want to be more skeptical of this app. But I've removed the variables it measures on some things it detects... and I can't explain wtf, just happened. If its a subject that intrigues you. I really recommend this app (I ended up upgrading to the paid app). For entertainment only, it can be a blast.",No
My friend is soon freaked out of this app. There are a lot of deamons in my house....üòà Frighting!,No
Works well be careful,No

"I love this app. It detected Japan..well i'm at my aunt's and uncle's house and they got Asian decorations in the living room. Then it said furniture, they do have furniture in there. The next one said exist....that got me...the others were fun, and used.",No
This app is very awesome!I got the message &#34;Afraid Already?&#34; And &#34;ruler&#34;,No
fun and makes you wonder if this is really picking up readings from the other side or if it's just a ???.,No
"this app is really weird what do the red dots mean? there evrywere! this may sound strange but I can see most I know this sounds strange but I can talk to them last night a really scathe one came in my dream with brown hair never brushed or showered holding a basket full of cat heads and an army of headless cats behind her and she said ""you cant save the one who sees "" I'm the one who sees if you find me ever I can prove it later",No
"Who doesn't love this?I bought the CONNECT version as well. I love these Apps. They are a lot of fun, but the Ghost Radar:Connect has a lot more features than this one.",No
"I downloaded this app before work I work in. a school building, me and a friend ended up going to the secont story of the building right when we reached the SS room the word ""definition"" came up, soon after we went back down and infringe of the sciense room it said ""grow it isweired sense they where growing and studding plants that week! me and my friend where freeked! I went into the hystoryroom and as soon as I steeped in the word ""attenchin"" came up and 8 red dots where all around me.

"Being a bit into the spirit world myself, this was a fun app to have. I also have a friend who is in touch with spirits and uses this same app. It's also fun to use at night and see if any messages come through.",No
"While I have yet to get an answer to a question it does give you responses and some of them are the oddest words. The word bank must be huge. I have kept it for fun and have even put it on my android. I have had both on together but not picked up the same thing in the same place or gotten the same word on both in fact I have not heard the same word twice on one device or any of the three together (wife's android). So i feel that a random generator/selector is not part of the program since most of those things ""pick""  the same word from time to time. just try it what can it hurt?!?",No
"I downloaded this to creep out my wife. I fired it up and had it running when she entered the room. I explained that it will detect spirits and they can communicate to us through it. Our dog then entered the room and it said ""pony"". Our dog is very large and is commonly referred to as moose, horsey and...pony! I figured it was just a randomly generated word but decided to use it to tease my wife so I said ""There is a spirit trying to communicate with us and it saw the dog come into the room and called it a pony!"" It then said ""understanding""! It freaked us both out. I'm not going to show this one to the kids or they may not be sleeping well.",No
I lost my basketball a few weeks before this and just for fun I downloaded this and it told me follow I had no idea then me came scared me a bit then said outside I nervously stepped outside and tree I live next to the woods so I went to the edge of the tree line too scared to go farther it said rabbit I'm like WTF and to the left a rabbit goes by so I follow that and about 10 minutes later I find my ball this TOTALLY works,No
"I bought this before I had the money to buy regulat equipment. This uses your cell phone. It really works to help locate the undead that your searching for. If you can't afford fancy equipment, for the price, go for it. It worked for me!",No
"So i got this app, and then when i played with is it said ""atom"" and "" learning"". I kinda got freaked out bcause i was learning about atoms and was buliding two models. Like i think its accurate.",No
it is cool but not real but it is weird bcuz I picked up my bag and it said the word bag. and my dad was making dinner in the kitchen and it said the word kitchen. we have a lot of ghosts in our house. you should try it at least it free,No
"Not sure if it really measures the energy in the air correctly since I did it with my Kindle Fire, but it is interesting.  My husbands friend introduced me to it and we played with it first on his phone.  We experimented with it and when we asked it to show us 5 dots it did so.  Most of the time we got 1 or 2.  They did pop in here and there but not stay steady like a scam would appear.  Again, I am no expert, but it did seem somewhat real.  If nothing else, its an interesting and fun thing to use and start conversation with if your into the paranormal like we are.  Will play with it when I get the ability, to continue the experiments.",No
excellent product and service.,No
So i was using this app and the word vowel comes up and i was watching tv and the show was wheel of fortune. How creepy,No
"I would believe in this app. it's creative..whether or not that this is real, it certainly go me thinking..so recently we received progress reports stapled on the bullentin board with our id numbers to tell which grade was yours.. so I got a C..not my bestest grade and I was complaining about it all day..once I opened this app I thought it would be really neat to try it out..the first thing it said was 'mathematics' I was totally freaked! so ghost making fun of my math skills.... -.-",No
I installed this on my kindle..the first time it scanned it showed dot on the radar and my grandfathers name came up..not his real name but we called him. There is no way that it could have known this info or gotten it from ANY source on my kindle in anyway what so ever. So I have to believe there might be something to this..as much as I don't want to. Becareful because it could seriously freak someone out. Especially someone who believes in ghosts.,No
"Although the readings were things we didn't really understand, it was still an adventure. I reccomend this because it gives you something to do c:",No
It was a little fun and freaky at times.,No
"This a nice amusement and who knows? I'm pretty sure ghosts exist, this app seems to pick up random energy or words and it is able to translate this into words, sounds and so on. It's fun.",No
"While I do not believe in ghosts, I do believe this app is picking up something in the surrounding areas, and yes, it is entertaining to think there is ""something there.""",No
sometimes you get an app that is just for fun and works well this is one of them.  Dont think it really works but it is fun.  I like it thanks,No

"Not saying it is, or isn't legit, but it is lots of fun. Well worth the time to download, and certainly the free version is worth the cost.",No
This app is eerie and fun,No
"Entertaining app to scare my sister with.  Sometimes the ""ghosts"" are all over the place.  Hard to tell how ""close"" they are if they are really there. But entertaining non the less.",No

I would definitely recommend this ap because its really entertaining!! :D",No
"Well when i first got this i thought in my mind ""this wont work ghost arent real.."" and right as i thought that a red dot appeared and it said evidence that creeped me out then it said wet which is weird because we have a leak in the house it also said mine but im not sure what that means anyway i think that this app works and is pretty cool and made me believe",No

"this app is considerably real. maybe....I don't know what to think, but all I have to say is one night I asked the radar what my deceased grandfather's name was.......it told me his ENTIRE name. of course not all my questions were answered in intelligent way..but it is something that brought a tear to my eye",No
i love it and it's fun to play. i love to play games it com's my nerves after a long day.,No

This version is easy to use. I said some things after I asked a question, and they were right on the money. Creeepy!",No
"I was downstairs in my dining room and caught a red ghost, it said ""brush"" and my brush was right confront of me.I don't know if ghosts are real or not, but that was pretty cool.now my radio is playing "" All She Wants to do is Dance "" and a ghost said ""dance"". that was pretty cool.THIS APP IS REALLY WORTH DOWNLOADING, PLUS.ITS FREE!!!!!!!",No
"I always enjoy watching Ghost Adventures and The Dead Files so downloaded this free for the fun of using it. When my son used it he got some action and a few words so he enjoyed playing with it. When I used it nothing, but still one of those things that is fun to pull out when you are bored to waste a little time. We have not tried it outside the home. I would like to point out that even the expert ghost hunters don't get action everytime they do a lockdown at a location so just have fun with it!",No

I just bought the fire stick 4K. It was to replace the original fire stick I bought a few years ago and was on a special price sale. Really my remote control for the first one just fell in water and I couldn't use it so well and compared to the 4K the old one had its day.Still getting some pixelization and buffering but far less and there are all kinds of videos to help on YouTube to even do things that people don't know fire sticks do?With the half-price sale and the quality of the stream that I get now I'm happy I spent a few more dollars to get updated to 4K,No

"If you are a sports enthusiast, this is the app for you. You are able to follow professional teams, college teams, and even high school teams.Pros: The app has multiple pages which allow you to easily access different teams. You can follow news, twitter messages, betting odds, videos, and pictures with the tap of a finger. I really enjoy the option of picking favorite teams. By doing this, your news feed is customized and you can filter out any ""uninteresting"" news.Cons: This application has often crashed and kicked me off on my Fire tablet. Sometimes, I am unable to view certain videos. Besides these cons, I am very interested in this app.Overall, I recommend this app to sports enthusiasts who want instant access to sports news. You will find it very useful.",No

"Update: 9-10-2017Well the latest app update removed the ability to watch a live NFL game on my digital projector. Dear CBS, you are going the wrong way. I pay for full cable TV and yet I can't stream a live game of my home team. My rating has gone from a 1 star to a 4 star and now back to a 1 star.Like many of these streaming apps they are tending to get worse rather than better in what they offer and in performance.Update:When I first got this app I tried for over a month to watch multiple sporting events and I could not stream any live sporting events. My primary interest was to watch the NFL games on CBS. Today I was in the basement working and I turned on the digital projector and the CBS Sports app and the NFL AFC playoff game was on line between the Patriots and the Pittsburg Steelers. It was streaming perfectly in HD quality with no issues. I have raised my rating from 1 star to 4 stars.I hope CBS keeps streaming live sports like this. This will make this app much more useful with my Amazon Fire TV stick. Many of the people that gave this app a poor rating should try to see if it is working now.  Thanks CBS for fixing this issue.----------------Original review:I have full cable service and I use multiple apps to play TV channel programs live on a wide screen projector in our entertainment room. Many of the apps for TV channels allow me to sign in and prove that I am a customer of a TV provider, like ATT U-verse, and it automatically lets my watch live video on the projector wirelessly. I use a Fire TV Stick to do this. This app will not let you watch live TV at all. For my purposes of watching an NFL game I find this app useless for my application.I find it amazing that so many other national channels allow you to stream live video for free once you register that you are paying for cable TV, but not CBS!  It shows a lot of bits and pieces of talk shows about sports that I don't  care about. This app for me is a 1 star and I would rate it lower if I could. CBS needs to catch up with its competitors and show live TV. ESPN, TNT, FOX, NBC, Disney, and ABC do it properly and there are other stations that also stream live TV. CBS needs to wake up and realize that this is 2016 and a digital world and not 1950!-------------So far the app is still working reasonably well.",No

"I stream using the Amazon Fire Stick, though I have cable through Spectrum.  Spectrum offers a fully functional streaming app that provides its whole listing of live channels, but it is unavailable on Amazon.  Thus, I use the different sports apps--ESPN, Fox Sports, NBC, CBS Sports--to stream games.  Recently, however, the CBS Sports app will not let me stream live games.  It lets me log in with my Spectrum account, but then tells me that my area is not supported.  I do not know what changed, but it is extremely frustrating because I love watching SEC and NFL football on CBS.  If there is a solution to my problem, I would love to hear it.",No
"I downloaded this app on my Fire Stick because I saw that CBS was live streaming the Super Bowl this year.  I cannot pick up CBS with my antenna, so this was the perfect alternative.  I was able to watch the Super Bowl hassle free.  This was my only reason for downloading the app as I have no other use for it because I do not watch sports year round.",No
"I bought a fire tv cube, because the 2 Firestickís I had purchased previously didnít work. Where I lived previously the Firestick never even flickered. Iím ready to return all of my products and get cable. Iíve rebooted computer, tv and Firestick and cube. I donít have any receipts, just the cube box, I bought the cube and one of the Firestickís at Bestbuy and the other stick I cannot recall. What do you think the problem is? Is there something I should be doing? Everyone in the house use cable, I like having control of what I watch, not what the cable company wants me to watch. Also I love live sports. Please help or give me my $130 ish back. Yours truly,  Pierre Langlois",No
"Streaming the Super Bowl was at best bad, consistently buffering throughout the game, FPS dropping to nothing but pix elated blobs and unidentifiable objects. But on the upside! CBS streamed each and every commercial break in full HD!  Never once during the commercial breaks did the I ever witness the poor reception as I did throughout the game. Funny.At least I accomplished one thing on Superbowl Sunday, I finished my laundry during the buffering sessions.",No
"I can only talk for the application during the SuperBowl. I download it to watch the game and it never worked, it was just showing a blue screen with a circle in the middle. I know the connection wasnt my problem as the cbs application for android worked perfectly on my cell or the web page in my lap i just wasnt able to use this one in my firetv",No

"I was worried that getting set up would be difficult or that the game would be laggy. To my absolute delight, it was easy to get set up and the stream was damn near flawless. My family cut the cord years ago, and it was nice to be able to watch the game for the first time in several years.",No
"I downloaded this app to watch the Super Bowl, but it would do nothing but sit there with a spinning circle in the middle of the screen. I finally switched and used the NFL app and it worked perfectly.",No
The local channel in Tucson was having transmission issues so I went to this venue and everything was steady and perfect.  This is better than watching local television.,No

"It is nice to see a free AP available to watch something that you should be able to get over-the-air transmission. But, CBS broadcast is horrible over-the-air (compared to other stations in the same area)...so you try the CBS website...nope that still is devoid of atmospheric pressure (ie has a vacuum...hence it well...sucks). And, finally when you get to the free app...its no better. CBS seems so so far behind the competition when it comes to delivering a solid and reliable digital broadcast whether it be over-the-air or on the wire. CBS should not be given the chance to broadcast the big game again until they can get vacuum problems resolved.",No

"For some strange reason, my Directv decided to go out at about an hour before the Super Bowl and of course, the agent could not get it to work again saying a technician needed to come to my home but of course, none were available on Sunday.

So I heard you could ""Watch Super Bowl 50 LIVE with the CBS sports app"" ---- I thought ""yeah right"".... Low and behold, I downloaded it the morning of the game, and I'd say around 2pm ET I clicked ""watch now"" on the app and there it was.... pre-talk and commentary all the way up until the game, and then the game itself. No buffering/streaming issues and fantastic HD picture quality. I was pleasantly surprised.",No

"Update: 9-10-2017Well the latest app update removed the ability to watch a live NFL game on my digital projector. Dear CBS, you are going the wrong way. I pay for full cable TV and yet I can't stream a live game of my home team. My rating has gone from a 1 star to a 4 star and now back to a 1 star.Like many of these streaming apps they are tending to get worse rather than better in what they offer and in performance.Update:When I first got this app I tried for over a month to watch multiple sporting events and I could not stream any live sporting events. My primary interest was to watch the NFL games on CBS. Today I was in the basement working and I turned on the digital projector and the CBS Sports app and the NFL AFC playoff game was on line between the Patriots and the Pittsburg Steelers. It was streaming perfectly in HD quality with no issues. I have raised my rating from 1 star to 4 stars.I hope CBS keeps streaming live sports like this. This will make this app much more useful with my Amazon Fire TV stick. Many of the people that gave this app a poor rating should try to see if it is working now.  Thanks CBS for fixing this issue.----------------Original review:I have full cable service and I use multiple apps to play TV channel programs live on a wide screen projector in our entertainment room. Many of the apps for TV channels allow me to sign in and prove that I am a customer of a TV provider, like ATT U-verse, and it automatically lets my watch live video on the projector wirelessly. I use a Fire TV Stick to do this. This app will not let you watch live TV at all. For my purposes of watching an NFL game I find this app useless for my application.I find it amazing that so many other national channels allow you to stream live video for free once you register that you are paying for cable TV, but not CBS!  It shows a lot of bits and pieces of talk shows about sports that I don't  care about. This app for me is a 1 star and I would rate it lower if I could. CBS needs to catch up with its competitors and show live TV. ESPN, TNT, FOX, NBC, Disney, and ABC do it properly and there are other stations that also stream live TV. CBS needs to wake up and realize that this is 2016 and a digital world and not 1950!-------------So far the app is still working reasonably well.",No

It seems that fox Florida sun doesn‚Äôt show all of the lightning games. Sometimes it switches over to basketball if that happens load Fox Sports go if you have a DIRECTV NOW account or many others you can sign in and watch the game you want instead of what is scheduled for TV.

Love this app. It works well on my iPad iPhone Kindle and PC. However my only complaint is that the app does not work on my Fire TV Stick.

Fox Sports Go app works well,No
"The app is decent, but needs a lot of work. I have found that with many of these channel apps (ABC go, CWTV, etc.) the structure is missing certain things. While the app itself is organized in an easily followed format, I find that it is very unresponsive sometimes. If you try to open the app and click on a show, then an episode, and then play too quickly, the app has a chance to freeze and crash; like a lot.Overall if you missed an episode and need a way to catch up, the app is nice, if you can get past the freezing. A perk that is included is one episode unlock: meaning if you do not have cable or satellite and want to watch a current episode (You have to wait a week for episodes to be released). then you are able to watch one.",No

I'm in rual mid-Michigan and the Fox station here broadcasts only in 480. I was dreading watching the Superbowl  in that. When I got the notice that Fox Sports was streaming it live I jumped on it. 4 stars on the streaming because during KCs 1st score  I lost video. Re-connected and it was great for the rest of the evening.,No
"I used this product to watch the Husker game. Although the team didn't quite pull off the result we wanted, the picture quality was for the most part great! The app did crash once during the game, and when it came back on the picture was blurry for a few seconds, but after that it back to being awesome! My major complaint is that they ran the same commercials back to back--3 commercials for the tennis channel in a row for example. Other than that, great experience.",No
"Yeah, it worked great.  for ONE HOUR.  If I wanted to see the rest of the game, I had to pay for it.  My team isn't even in the Series.  NOPE!",No
"Love that Fox Sports has this free APP, but would love it even more if this APP had Fox Sports Detroit (FSD) channel also. Very disappointed that it doesn't & hope they add this channel.",No
"Explain why an update was made that now requires the user to use two different FOX APPS in order to what sports, all depending on which FOX CHANNEL the game is being broadcasted on? That is the most ridiculous development, and should be rolled back immediately. Fox Sports Go was great, but now I also need Fox Sports App for my game that is on Fox and not FS1 or FS2. Fix this.",No
"Streaming was great when it worked , I'm saying that there was segments of streaming that the internet froze. probably not FOX's fault. otherwise it was great.",No
Great app for NFL games!,No

"The channel has a great, clear picture. I watched Superbowl 51 with it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it timed out for about 5 minutes during the game, and I had to restart the app. Other than that, I would recommend it!",No
Love this app. It works well on my iPad iPhone Kindle and PC. However my only complaint is that the app does not work on my Fire TV Stick. Not because the app is not available but because my cable provider is not available on the Fire Stick TV. This makes absolutely no sense since cox communications is all over the country and it works on my Kindle which is an Amazon device also. Please add Cox Communcations to the list of providers!,No
App worked great a month ago.  Now the sound and video are not synched up.  Please fix!  Your app can be great,No

Love that my hubby never misses a game. It's like having season tickets to every game only with a better view! Happy hubby Happy wife,No
"This app allows us to watch some live sporting events on our FireTV through our PlayStationVue subscription. These are games that the Fox network on the PSVue does not carry, so this is a great feature.It works erratically on the Fire TV - it will randomly fail in the live stream and play a short (15 second) piece of the game over and over.I have had better luck with the Fox Sports Go iOS app, it is more reliable.",No

Now of course I downloaded this app to watch the Super Bowl this year, just like many other people did.  It started out working great but then after halftime it started to buffer and then eventually the stream was lost for quite some time.  Lucky for me I had other streams I could turn to in order to watch the game but I thought the FOX stream would have been the way to go.",No
Didn't work.,No

While the app itself is organized in an easily followed format, I find that it is very unresponsive sometimes. If you try to open the app and click on a show, then an episode, and then play too quickly, the app has a chance to freeze and crash; like a lot.Overall if you missed an episode and need a way to catch up, the app is nice, if you can get past the freezing. A perk that is included is one episode unlock: meaning if you do not have cable or satellite and want to watch a current episode (You have to wait a week for episodes to be released). then you are able to watch one.",No
Downloaded to watch the super bowl. Worked great until 10 min. left and it stopped working. Missed the best part don't know if that is supposed to happen but it did.,No
Great,No
Great app,No
"Used to be great but when I could actually use it but now every time I enter it, it tells me I need an update to use it and there is no update available",No
Great sport coverage,No
"Would be great if Comcast allowed the broadcasts. As it stands, I am a fan of the Big East, and cannot watch the live games I missed.",No
The sound was off and choppy. The video quality was great,No
Not that great.,No
It was great until the feed stopped with 7:29 left in the superbowl. The only feed that would work was in Spanish. All local commercials were in Spanish,No
Great if program actually loads,No
Does not work with Comcast.Cumbersome at best to use.,No
"Works great on my Kindle...was really really hoping it would work on my Amazon Fire Stick...but alas, it's not available for that yet.",No
Great for someone that doesn't want to pay for cable. It only got lost once and for a highly viewed show.  It did great!!!!,No
Awesome app,No
Th is app is great when not buffering. I ran a speed test while it buffered and was getting 86 mbps so not connection speed. Happens with the fox sports Sun channel during the heat games.  Please fix this as this only way I can watch while away.,No
GREAT!,No
Great App!  Would give 5 except that I'm one of those people who knows this is not a perfect world.,No
Was able to watch the game...picture was great...slowed (froze) once.....still enjoyed the game and of course the win!!,No
It requires for cable provider and live stream is nit the best,No
Nice to watch Super Bowl for free but the feed went down for about 15 minutes and caused me to miss part of the game.  Still better than paying for cable though.,No
"I can have sports on, on my phone while I'm doing repetitive stuff at work. It's great.",No
great app to watch football games,No
Works great,No
"App doesn't work at all on Fire TV anymore, great timing for it to fail with the WWC going on.",No
"This app never allowed us to choose Comcast as the provider, it works great on my iPad but deleting from fire tv, what a waste!",No
We loved it. We were able to watch the World Series. Thanks Fox Sports Go! Recommend it to everyone. So easy!,No
Works great most of the time,No
"Worked great, loved the app. Updated one day and now it won't open... says it requires an upgrade.  Amazon store shows no upgrade... button says open... open says you need an upgrade. Round and round. 2 uninstalls and reinstalls...Nothing.All I wanted to do was sit on my porch and watch the Cleveland Indians and drink some beers after doing yard work all night. Damn",No
I first used the App last night to watch my Kansas City Royals.  Awesome!,No
This app works great on my Kindles but sucks on my surface pro 3 . It keeps giving me a media error.,No
"We have used this service for the last 5 months.  The attraction was getting Redzone, that being said the quality of the broadcasts are poor at best.  We have a 1g Wifi plus the smart tv is connected via Ethernet.  The ability to navigate the home screen with Samsung remote is not intuitive at all.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if you record or watch something live, the app seems to buffer excessively.  Watching the Super Bowl put us over the edge.  The picture was highly pixelated and images were indistinguishable.  As soon as our month is over, we are done.  Very disappointed. And it is not cheap.  We are going to do Apple TV.",No
"I love this app because I didn‚Äôt want a cable package but wanted to be able to watch the Devils this season. Fubo is the only service that includes MSG and has an app on the FireStick. Since this review is on Amazon and about the app I will make it about my experience with the FireStick app.It‚Äôs great, when it works. I experience significant buffering and skipping, sometimes all out freezes that cause me to have to restart the stream. None of my other apps do this, so I have to lay the blame with the app. This can be incredibly bad when watching an exciting game and you get a freeze right as a big play is being made. So while I have been pleased with the service on ChromeCast and on my iOS devices the FireStick app needs some work.",No
"I bought this service and cant log into my account using my firestick. I have searched all throughout the internet. I have changed my password 3 times hoping that would help. I deleted the app on my firestick and re-downloaded the application onto my firestick and it still doesnt work. I can log on using my browser. Not my amazon firestick. This is absolutely the worst product out on the market today. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT it is not seamless, not intuitive and after you spend your hard earned money you will NOT be able to use your amazon firestick to log into the product you legally purchased. For the love of god do not buy this product. It is a huge waste of money, fubo should be working tirelessly, it is the world cup and they would get a massive following if they offered a great product, but they can not offer this product they want to laugh as my brasilian family weeps.",No
"I'm currently in the FuboTV seven day trial. Thus far, I've found a few bugs in the Fire TV app. (At least, if you're using the Fire TV Game Controller.) Pause, fast forward and reverse do not work. On the game controller, pressing the ""A"" button pauses Amazon, Sling, DirecTV Now and Playstation Vue playback. It does not, however, work with Fubo. Additionally, if you exit playback mid-program, there is no ""resume"" feature. Conversely, playback on a PC has no problems whatsoever. I just much prefer watching TV on an actual TV. (And yeah, I know, I can ""cast"" from my computer.)DVR recordings are limited to only 10. That's something I can live with because I'm only recording motorcycle racing on Bein Sports. That said, if I was using Fubo as my primary streaming service, that would be a deal breaker.As for image/video quality, there are no issues. It's on par with all of the other streaming services (aside from Amazon with their AMAZING UHD 4K playback.)I suspect FuboTV will fix their Fire TV app quickly, so I'll probably try them again in a few months. They are definitely on the right track, but the Fire TV app is certainly in its infancy.",No
"I am enjoying using FuboTV for watching all of my sports (baseball, football, golf, basketball, etc..).  The service is the only one that I have found that includes the sports channels that carry my local teams.  The only reason I did not give a 5 star rating is that while watching local channels like ABC it will skip back 30 minutes or so all of the sudden.  If you are not paying attention you will not realize you are watching a stream from 30 minutes in the past.  You just have to switch channels and switch back and it goes back to a live stream.  I have only noticed this on the local channels like ABC.  I did watch the Redzone channel this past Sunday and did not experience buffering which was great.",No
"I tried FUBO tv. I first problem was I could not get out of market NFL games. The second problem I could not get ESPN. I contacted their technical support spent 55 minutes on phone, he could not fix the problem. He said the he would elevate the support call. Did not here back from support. Cancelled service. The problem was that when I went  into ESPN, I would just have spinning circle and then get rebooted out the FUBO, then would screwup Fire TV.When I uninstalled the APP, rebooted, everything went back to normal and has been working great!",No
"It has great options for channels however most of the sport channels (especially Bein Sports 3,4-10) has pretty much nothing going on all afternoon. There are so much streaming issues because of their servers issues. The only reason I'm so sure about that is I also use Play Station Vue and I dont have that problem with PS Vue. They need more work on their skin and they can make it a little more friendly user. I love the DVR options. But definitely doesn't worth 40 bucks a month.",No
"The app sounds great for a soccer fan like me, however there are two main things that make suspicious about this app.First the free day trial seems like a fake because I was charged to my credit card immediately. Additionally, I was charged three times: one for 6.99 the plan I selected, one for 1.00 for no reason, and one for 0.00 that I have no clue why. I don't feel trust in those providers that attract you with offers that are not true.Second, their fire tv app keeps asking me to log in. And sometimes says that my password is incorrect, and then I need to reset it. It seems that my password is not protected with them.I hope they improve their app and their reputation, because the product they say the offer sounds attractive.",No
"I subscribed to the service for the final South American Qualifying matches on Oct 10th 2017. I logged in at game time and 10 minutes into the game the whole system experience an outage until the last 3 minutes of the games. I had people come over my house to watch the game and spent quite a bit on food and drink that was wasted. This is what I received the following day from fubo TV ::Dear Michael,Last night‚Äôs outage was unacceptable. You chose fuboTV to stream your games and we sincerely apologize for when we fail to deliver.When we started fuboTV, our goal was to build the world's greatest streaming service for live sports. We aren't all the way there yet. But we promise that we will be. And we want you to be there when it happens.Our team is working through the details of last night‚Äôs outage. If you‚Äôve contacted fuboTV via email or social networks, our team is listening and will respond as soon as it can.Every day we‚Äôre taking steps to make fuboTV the service we know it can be. We hope you‚Äôll stay with us on this journey.Sincerely,David GandlerAlberto HorihuelaSung Ho ChoifuboTV co-founders""I agree it was unacceptable and a simple apology wont fix it. How about some free months of service so I can try it out and gain some trust in the service?",No
"It's not the best or worst app for Fire TV. The app is easy enough to navigate, but nothing great. The picture sometimes pixelates or buffers.My main complaint is the FF/RW options! Why are we limited to 15 second skips? It would be far nicer if we could do a standard FF/RW. If I'm somehow missing how to do so, please let me know.Update: Added a star since you can press the FF/RW button repeatedly to add skip time in increments of 15 seconds. I've done as much as 3 minutes. I don't know if there's a limit. It would still be easier to have a regular FF/RW so I could watch any interesting ads.",No
They already charged me and was watching a game and 15 minutes later I was disconnected and couldn't get back in. My internet connection is excellent. The Fubo website kept stating to try again later. I gave up. I want to unsubscribe.,No
Streaming was fine although a station here and there was blurry. Channel guide operates so you have to go channel by channel.  If you are into sports and especially soccer it might provide greater value. 11 specific soccer channels and other soccer provided elsewhere. I didn't think the cost warranted the channel options. My current cable bill is cheaper and I get HD and some of the more popular channels that are included with Fubo.,No
"Mu wife and I decided to try Fubo and so far we love it. The only issue we have encountered is not being able to set our Home location but this is due to our internet provider being LTE based. Other than that the fact that you can get virtually all the channels we had with Dish, you can DVR via the cloud and stream to different devices is a huge plus. If you are not sure about trying I would encourage you to do so, it is not HULU but again you do not see the issues with home location you do with HULU.",No
"so i signed up for fubo tv, thinking their offerings for streaming would be a great deal. would be if it actually streamed anything. i got slow to no streaming altogether and then if or when the picture actually held, the quality was blurred and unclear. the selection of shows to watch seemed great. but of no use to me if they don't actually stream. hope others have better luck than i did.",No
"fuboTV is a great streaming service for the avid sports fans.  plus there are other non-sports channels available, so on the down-time from your favorite sports team, there are many movies and TV shows for added entertainment.the downside to this service is the lack of a hockey central channel, NHL Network, whereas the NFL, MLB and NBA to name a few, have theirs on fuboTV..  this is a deal breaker, to say the least, because, you know, residing in this household are huge hockey fans.",No
"I really liked what I saw during the trial but I had some questions that have not yet been answered.  I could not find BBC which is a channel my husband watches all the time.  Also, I have a FireStick on my TV but not on my husband's.  He has a smart TV but I was not sure how to access FUBO.  If they ever get BBC I will definitely use this service.  Everything about it was great!",No
I did a lot of research on streaming apps that provided the most channels for the best dollar when I finally cut the cord with Spectrum. The pros are the channels and I'm happy to see 24 hour horse racing - TVG. Cons are the app buffers all the time and you have to shut the app down and relaunch it.  My internet speed and bandwidth is fully capable of handling a flawless experience but Fubo does not provide it.,No
"Fubo has its strengths in sone sports the other options don't have.  I tried after YouTube tv but ended up going back to YouTube because of better channels and locals.  Using an external antenna for locals gave me a poor quality abc.  I didn't really get into dvr space in that week,  but YT has more.  Menus aren't great.  I could live with this if a better option didn't exist,  but it does.  Im trying to replace Vue, and none of the options measure up, but YT is closest.  I might go back to fubo next football season depending on if anyone else picks up red zone after vue's end",No
They should add more channels such as ESPN and then it'd be great. We use it mostly for the local channels but it does have quite a few regular cable channels. I chose this streaming service over ALL the others out there after I tried them all. What I've learned is no streaming service can compete with satellite service but then again it's less than half the cost.,No
"Not sure if this is an issue with Fubo or Amazon. I was considering this for my mother with extremely low vision since they carry the local channels but Amazon Fire stick would open the app but not go to a particular channel by voice.  Since she can't read the guide, this is a non-starter for me. It works great with Sling but they don't have access to local channels so now I am back to square one.",No
"I want to like Fubo.  My husband is a soccer fan and it has the best soccer coverage. I was disappointed to find that CBS has gone bye-bye.  Also, the buffering is driving me crazy.  It is not my internet because I have around 65 mbps download speed and Netflix works fine, and does usually Amazon Prime.  Hope they fix the buffering - and get CBS back.",No
"On the outset, it is the best for the price charged, with a LOT of channels at less than $50 a month, however the service does have some hefty programming problems.  First, its very sports oriented, and since we do not watch/carefor sports, that aspect is a waste of $$ for us.  Second, (We did not notice this before signing up)  there is simply NO ABC at all, so we still have to use our old antenna to get ABC.  Lastly, tho we do not speak Spanish, there are several Spanish only channels forced on us as well, again, another waste of $$ on us.",No
"I had to give fubo high marks for stream and picture quality, and, really, ease of use is really very decent as well...unless you're into sports and happen to live outside what appears to be line of sight of the stadium. I tell you, the fubo app, menu, DVR, time shifting, all are absolutely superb. Then, if you're a sports fan, and happen to live outside the magic circle, the other shoe drops. Now, hear this: from where I live, just outside Seattle, I get the Seahawks games with Xfinity, Dish, hulu, att now, youTube TV, etc etc. But with fubo, what I get is an ""Oops!"" display with a notification blaming the NFL for blacking out the Seahawks. Its not the NFL, folks, its fubo going cheap-s*** with their content contracting. The irony of fubo's advertising themselves as sports centric isn't lost on me. The thing about that circle I'm within with every other TV supplier, is that every little bit it extends embraces that many more eyeballs...that just doesn't make sense. fubo was great on the phone until I asked why every other service carried the games to where I live. Since then, its been crickets. So. Try fubo. Maybe you're lucky enough to be ""in area"". But if you're not, and you ask why, you'll be ghosted. Nice.",No
"I signed up the day before Super Bowl 54. It was live all day, up until the game. Then, it displayed a logo and provided only audio as in a Radio Broadcast.I canceled the next day.So much for providing the best in Sports Broadcasting, when it couldn't even broadcast the BIGGEST GAME OF THE YEAR!!!I watched the Spanish Broadcast, for live coverage.",No
This is a wonderful app designed for streaming live television. I really have no complaints with the service other than wishing that there were some more channels but that's of no fault to the service.I do recommend this app if you want to save some money on your monthly cable box subscription.,No
"I'm presently with Vue, and hate the sports setup they have.  I'm just close enough to Chicago that the Fox Sports stations cannot show sports programming, due to blackout rules.  So, I tried Fubo.  I love the selection of channels, the picture and streaming are great, and the sports selection is impressive.  Except, no ESPN.  So, no college football.  That is the only reason for the three stars, and not 5.  I think I will stay with Fubo, and add the ESPN app.Hopefully, nirvana is just around the corner.",No
"Interface is great. easy to use but im having some buffering issues. i dont have this type of problem with other steaming services like netflix, hulu, etc but i guess maybe the difference is this is live TV? it was terrible while watching the superbowl. my kids are getting frustrated also while watching their shows Nick jr, etc. likely going to cancel.",No
"I love The TV that Fubo provides, great channel lineup.  My problem is with the audio issues this app had CONSTANTLY!!  I'll click a show to watch on demand and hear two different audio tracks playing. Then I exit the show but the audio will continue to play, even when I exit the Fubo app altogether, the audio will continue to play into other apps.  I have to restart my FireStick completely to get it to stop.  Please fix this!!",No
"Have tried many different live streaming companies (AT&T, Hulu, Xbox, etc). Liked fubo the best in terms of simple and smooth navigation within the app. Only problem in my opinion is that it‚Äôs too pricey and the different channel groups are cleverly arranged so you‚Äôd have to get the even pricier package to be able to see all the important sports channels.",No
"I recently got this app just to watch the Real Madrid vs Barcelona game.I was not able to watch the game due to buffering. I had to subscribe to Sling TV be able to watch the game (after trying multiple troubleshooting steps for at least 15 minutes). Same channel, same internet service, same tv, same Fire TV, however the fubo app just keeps buffering, while sling tv worked perfectly. Don't get Fubo TV.",No
"My only complaint, but it hindered us greatly was the inability to watch content that you were recording simultaneously.  Example, if you started recording something and then wanted to start viewing it perhaps 15-30 after it started, you couldn't.  You had to wait until about an hour after the entire program was recorded to watch.",No
All the channels I watch and none of the useless extras. Recording feature works great. Would like it if the fast forward actually scrolled on a timeline and you could see the video moving forward in real time. Right now your forward clicks move the show forward blindly in increments of 15 seconds.,No
"I use PSVue and love it. It has a Cloud DVR as does Fubo, which was the main selling point for me. These are the only 2 streaming services that offer that. So far. But Fubo is supposed to be for sports enthusiasts. It's marketed and advertised that way but ESPN is not available. Really? The premier sports network. No Animal Planet, or HBO.The channel line-up on every other streaming service is better than what they offer. Sorry, but I didn't like it.",No
Really bad experience with this service. My 3 first recordings did not work so I missed the games. They restored them 2 days after but obviously I already knew the results. Also very poor streaming quality. I hope they improve with time since the selection of sports event is best in market.,No
"This is a great streaming service with most channels available except a few like TVOne and others. I am considering this service to replace my DirecTV Now/AT&T TV. The interface could be a little better and I wish it would continue to play the current channel while I browse the guide.If they fix that and offer a discount with Showtime, I'm sold.",No
"I love the fact that this has nearly all sport channels (big exception: no ESPN!). B10, pac 12, fox sports, etc.. The only knock I give it is that it's hard to find out what's coming up. I think there's a lot more to fubo, if only I can find it!",No
"We started the fubotv on my husband's cell phone it worked perfect, we moved to the iPad it worked perfect but when trying to log in on the fire stick it would not log in at all, there is no option to log in with fb on the fire stick and that's how my husband started the account, when entering the email and password manually the account wasn't recognized. Other than that we love the app",No
Great selection of tv shows & movies. I was happy to find an app I could finally watch Dr. Phil on but disappointed I can‚Äôt afford to buy it. Love the DVR feature. Just wish you could pick which channels you want & only pay for those,No
"The only problem is it does not have the abc channel which is channel 7 in chicago. I would have given it a 5 star, but since it doesn't have that channel which is one of my favorite channel. I rate it 3 stars. Overall everything else is great.",No
This is just another version of cable service. List of stuff I don‚Äôt care to see. Nice that it had ESPN and some sports but cost too much to just get ESPN. I can do with those sports. So too costly for what you get.,No
has great channels! & on demand options... wish the initial page is slightly different im not into sports so i use the guide maybe provide the option for intial pg to start as sports or guide w channels. Im canceling as will get channels w xfinity cheaper for now will see what happens in 12 mos,No
"I'm happy with the number of channels we get , very compatible with cable ( we ordered extra channels). Get all the channels we love and the picture is clear. My only issue is that occasionally the sound will be behind the picture along with the live sound so you get a echo like effect, then if you change the channel that previous channel sound stays on. I found that if you restart the fire stick it re-sets and fixes the issue. Overall very happy with Fubotv",No
The stream quality wasn't great. Buggered and stalled from time to time even froze. My biggest problem is the price. $700 a yr for the same collection of channels everyone is offering of which you only watch maybe 10.,No
"Layout is a little odd/confusing. I wish it would open to the guide right away, instead of its own homescreen. Only NFL channel missing for us is ESPN, which I would love the option for, even if it was extra. Otherwise, there's a pretty decent mix of local channels and others, such as Cheddar.",No
"Stream live channels that I like,Hallmark Romance,Mysteries and Drama. Food channel and others. My husband likes the Fox‚Äôs News,sports History. Just canceled our service with Direct tv thru ATT that we had for 5years and our bill is 50% cheaper. We are not getting billed for there equipment, but I like there streaming the best .",No
Doesn‚Äôt always start up properly‚Äîrequires several attempts. When the Fire stick works the picture is excellent. Still have decided if it‚Äôs any better than the satellite services.,No
Internet is unavailable where I live but get great signal so everything has to run on airplay here.  This freezes up often and your recorded shows don‚Äôt keep playing.  You have to re-start each new episode.,No
Tried to get the 4K super bowl broadcast but would not give me the 4K HDR stream. The app was just reporting my screen size as 1920x1080 which is just HD resolution. Other 4K streams on fuboTV were only HD as well. Not entirely sure it was all fuboTVs fault. May be a problem with the fire stick 4K. I tried everything to get this to work and I know a lot about this stuff. I finally got the 4K HDR stream by just installing the FOX Sports app on the fire stick. That worked great.,No
"Got the trial a couple days ago to see how reliable it was. There's a great variety of sports channels to watch from, and the mobile app is really neat, but while watching Brazil x Colombia the app experienced an error and I couldn't watch anymore games that day, so all in all a complete waste of time and disappointing to say the least. The firecast TV app also displayed the wrong time zone for some reason and wasn't as refined as the mobile app.",No
"Was very happy at first, loved the programming.  Fit right in with what we like to watch. But in less than a week, the streaming was terrible.  It would freeze than fast forward to catch up.  The voices are out of sync.  Really disappointed!  I give it my trial time to see if it improves if not I will cancel.",No
"Nice streaming service, but price was not competitive to others. Definitely provides a lot of sports content, but honestly, if you are unable to watch local teams, then what's the point of paying for a lot of random sports channels?Lack of a search option was a real downside as well.",No
"Finally I get to watch my Astros play ball.  Thank you fubo!!  The fubo format isn't perfect, and I've had a bit of a learning curve,  but I'll take it every day over my old cable company!!",No
Fubo froze up a lot. It also would just shutdown.  Could be a lot more user friendly.Loved the line up.  In my area did not have all the local channels.,No
"The picture quality is great but the cloud recording did not show where you are. Also, the channels are difficult to get to. Finally, loading on my phone killed all streaming video. Not sure why.",No
It's great if they are playing the games you want to see. I even changed the VPN to a different state and it STILL didn't play the Seahawks game.,No
Found this service to be very expensive for what you get.  We cancelled after having a hard time using it for 4 months.  Now we use Hulu and love it.,No
"VERY DISAPPOINTED that  the saturday baseball game on MLB network (Boston-Houston) was NOT ON, instead they gave you golf, not just golf but womens golf. How in the hell do you get golf on the MLB network? EPIC FAILURE.  Other than that the site worked almost perfectly, Slight buffering on one movie very briefly. Navigation is a bit akward .  Will most likely join later this year.",No
lots of choices.  the channels are the best of cable channels and could be a lower cost item over a cable company.But its not real cheap and could be more money over a package deal from a cable company with voice data and video.,No
"I wanted to watch the Bears VS Green Bay game on Sunday as it was not televised locally. I subscribed to Fubo as it was advertised that I could watch this game, after downloading the app and going through the registration process I found I could not in fact see any games not already on my local cable. Now I cannot find out how to cancel without being charged. I'm sure this is a great app for someone without cable but it does not suit my needs.",No
"I love FuboTV. I'm giving it 3 stars because their functionality is no where close to play station vue. They have a long way to go to catch up. And yet they cost about the same. I picked Fubo because of it's channel line-up. Until something changes, I'll stick with Fubo.",No
"Loved the color & style of the boot, but the quality is poor; the shoe-bed is so hard they feel like like There is no inside lining or padding, just the shell of the shoe with no padding",No
"I love having so many choices in sports. The regular cable channels is an added bonus. I really like the DVR function too. The only problem is that it's not a very intuitive interface. I still can't get my dad to figure it out, the fact that he's 69 might have something to do with it though.",No
"Fubo would have been great but they don‚Äôt allow you to stream from different WiFi locations without interrupting your stream. So if I wanted to watch my football game at a friends house and login with my password, it will play, but an alert will pop up every minute or so and you have to click to continue which interrupts the other stream watching at home. It‚Äôs very annoying. Canceling it in a few days.",No
"Plus side, It‚Äôs great if you like all sports..negative a lot of times the guide doesn‚Äôt show all info, such as channel or what‚Äôs on.. intermittently  Overall I‚Äôd recommend it for sports fans but I only watch a limited amount of that so not sure if I‚Äôm gonna continue after the 7 days are up",No
ABC TV is not included. We watch that channel a lot. If they included ABC it would be our best choice,No
"Love how it's set up. But I would say every few days something happens on my firetv. All words are repeated twice. No picture but have sound, or just not work at all.  We are having technical difficulties. Kinda have a love hate for fubo.",No
We cut the cord and installed fireTV's on our 'dumb'TV's.  Fubo seemed to offer the best station selections for the $$.  It isn't as easy to navigate around as our U-verse but then its so much cheaper.,No
"Hulu Live in the past and loved it, but found Fubo to have the same + more for just a little more.  Streaming with rare buffering.  Will continue with Hulu basic and use Fubo for live TV.  Till something comes along.",No
Purchased to watch an out of region game on NBA TV. The game was blocked out on PS Vue. Great that we were able to get the game but the stream buffered every 30 seconds. Very annoying. My internet is 100mb down on fiber. My device was hard wired. I don‚Äôt ever have buffering issues when streaming other apps. The first 7 days were free and I will be canceling before I‚Äôm charged.,No
I don't recall  buying this but love the show...will have to research this purchase,No
Unfortunately does not show all the channels they advertise outside of the USA. Signed up thinking that was the case but there was no disclaimer. Wasted money and effort. Streaming picture is great and amongst the best but didn't like the fact they weren't up front about the programming.,No
"Very nice to have, could use better software and more control of display.",No
The Fubo app for iPhone worked great. Did not buffer at all. The app for Firestick running on the same WiFi connection buffered for 90 percent of the football game I tried to watch. I was able to watch Prime content on the firestick just fine. So I believe FuboTV doesn‚Äôt work on firestick as advertised. I canceled my subscription until I hear that the issue is resolved.,No
"We love the programming.  If ESPN were included, we would have rated it with 5 stars.",No
Always pauses bc of the Internet pictures sometimes blurry easy to use love all the channels,No
Fubo is a great idea but the streaming quality is not always the best. They advertise that you can watch shows on demand but only a minimal amount of channels actually have their shows on demand. The commercials will repeat and never get back to the show when watching on demand.,No
The streaming quality and app interface are average at best. The channel selection isn‚Äôt great and the subscription price seems too high for what you get. Hon stay this costs about as much as my cable package and has far fewer channels.,No
"Great content, but slightly awkward interface makes it difficult to select particular  events and days.  The availability of sports content not available elsewhere makes it all worthwhile.",No
"Not üî•Fire Tablet friendly!  On my cell if worked great first few days and now now t so much. On my laptop it always hangs up or becomes buffering frenzied. Then on cell CBS was not showing as a channel, but on laptop it did. Fire tablet runs so nice, so why can't Fubo and DirecTV NOW make it work!",No
"This is a great very inexpensive way to have live TV, especially football. I am originally from the SF Bay Area, and being able to watch my team, SF 49'rs in Seattle Seahawk land is a wonderful gift. I have listened to many games via radio and searched for live stream, but this is inexpensive and reliable and a wonderful experience.HIGHLY RECOMMEND",No
I loved the app but there is NO Way I will pay the crazy monthly fee,No
"I love this service.  The sports content is so diverse.  Soccer coverage is awesome, and it is at the right price point for me.Only gripe, no espn and abc, which can be painful for NCAAFootball.  But they have every other channel that does college stuff.  Highly recommend for cord cutters and sports fans, international soccer.",No
"I have Hulu at this time and a free trial run gave me the chance to check it out,  The streaming, picture quality, and format is excellent. At this time giving consideration to the comparable cost to Hulu.",No
It is the best of all the streaming services I have tried to this point.  The only down side is that it has none of the ESPN stations.  It has EVERY OTHER sports station know to man but not ESPN which was important to me.,No
"I do not recommend this service because even with a great internet connection, the stream kept cutting out or lagging, plus it was always about 30 seconds later than the live broadcast!! Not happy one bit,  very disappointed. I never give a bad review,  I simply choose to not say nothing at all, however, as a paying customer, I would've wanted to know.",No
"I tried the free trial for Fubo. The video quality on the FireTv was great, however the app was horrible.  A lot of obvious features that should be there were not. I tried the native app on my Samsung TV. The video quality was terrible, but the app had the features the FireTV was missing.",No
Buffers too much would have loved to keep it but???,No
Nice but too expensive please cancel trial membership,No
Honestly I really liked it. It had all the channels I love to watch but....IT COSTS WAY TO MUCH for what you get.,No
"This app freezes a lot whereas other live tv apps like Sling do not, also DOES NOT HAVE ESPN for for a ""sports app"" that's kind of a deal breaker.  Not the worst live tv app but not the best , middle of the pack.",No
"fubo is a fairly priced solution, but you MUST have great bandwidth available to you or you will be in a constant state of lag or screen freezing for more than 15 seconds at a time. Cancelled subscription within the trial period.",No
not that great of channels,No
This streaming site was just not for us. If you Love sports you may want to try it.,No
It‚Äôs a great streamer but it doesn‚Äôt have espn channels unfortunately.,No
Great quality and price,No
It‚Äôs a great app but too expensive,No
Compared to sling tv this isnt the best plus you cant even watched missed episodes why pay for $10 more for dvr and get another provider,No
"We use the FuboTV app on our fire stick in 3 rooms, In a month we‚Äôve had one bad day we‚Äôre it was lagging. Other than that one hiccup, I have no complaints. Love that I can watch the pac 12 network, unlike direct tv.",No
The program is the best. Getting started was difficult and reouired a call to help. The consultant was great and I am now running well.,No
"Great price, unparalleled quality, compared to the competition that is. Not 5 stars because at periods of high demand the servers are not able to cope and quality image issues arise. But in my opinion FUBO is the current leading TV streaming service for Sports and entertaining both in price and quality, and I have no doubt the kinks will be ironed in short. Suck it, CABLE.",No
Great,No
I love the colors that I get on fubo the resolution is beautiful. Sometimes it takes a very long time for the stream to come in with the buffering. It also freezes. This breaks your concentration.,No
"Great lineup, but I don‚Äôt watch enough sports or network tv to pay the additional money compared to other streaming services",No
The selection of channels is great. This app does freeze up and slow down the Firestick though. After watching Fubo we have to force stop apps and restart the Firestick to watch other apps. If this issue is corrected then Fubo would be terrific.,No
It's expensive and not worth it in my opinion. Did help me watch my football teams games so that was nice,No
"It is nice, particularly the Fire TV app because of it makes possible to record a match for latter viewing.The Apple tv version of the app it's more responsive but lacks de recording capability.",No
I am somewhat disappointed. Fubo blocked the Seahawk game when it was on cable and other satellite service. Nice thing is there is no contract so they can be gone next month.,No
Great,No
Great sports lineup. Needs simultaneous streaming in two locations to keep my business.,No
Great for watching sports and local channels. I watch MSBBC all the time!!  Very slow coming on and changing channels. Weak tc guide.,No
"The app works smooth and the guide set up is great. I could not get past NBC not being in the channel lineup. I turned the tv on ready to watch an NFL football game Sunday at noon and the light bulb goes off, I don‚Äôt have the game with Fubo",No
FuboTV has been great. Comparable to Sling but the channels offered and DVR option are better for the price. Tha app seems to work really well with my firestick.,No
Quality of streaming not great.,No
"It seems nice , but my wife wanted cable TV and I'm having trouble canceling it..",No
great better then prime,No
The local and sport channels are great and the interface is really easy to use.,No
"Great service and beats paying what our local provider would charge for access to the same channels. Love it! Only four stars due to not being able to jump to a channel from the ""Channel Guide"". Will find out today how well the DVR service works.",No
"I CANCELED THIS FUBO, NOTHING GREAT ABOUT IT, TOO EXPENSIVE",No
Not a great picture quality but easy to use app,No
"Excellent service - unbeatable for sports, and more than sufficient for other shows. You can get many shows on demand and pause and record live tv. Decent price. Would be better if you could watch and use the guide at the same time.",No
"Loved everything about it , the only dislike is that it doesn‚Äôt have ESPN. I know it has sports channels but there is nothing like ESPN",No
"Just needs ESPN & is missing 1 of the local channels. Not quite as polished as Playstation Vue, but well its still going & the Vue is going bye bye. Next to no buffering, so thats nice. Would be 5 stars if it had ESPN.",No
Once WiFi is strong service is excellent.,No
"Great service, but expensive",No
Love Fubo! Able to record all my favorite shows too! My only issue is that Fubo doesnt carry ESPN. But we are able to get ESPN elsewhere and pay for it separately.,No
Works great. Need more channels though.,No
"I use it to watch rangers hockey games.  Too frequently the stream freezes.  When it works it is great.  I aalso use it to watch the news, . It does not freeze as often. I will use  it to watch other shows.",No
Basically please. Soccer leagues and game coverage is excellent. MLB game coverage is very limited and of a team several hundred miles from me that is not my team.,No
"Read very carefully the contract, the app is amazing, but, too expensive.",No
"I dont have cable, but have a Firerestick and Sling TV for live tv. However Sling TV doesnt have the basic local channels, so I ordered fubo tv and it worked great. The reception was clear and the app was easy to use.",No
"not a great interface, problems with certain features causing app to close.",No
Great for sports fans but not having ESPN is a deal-killer.,No
Not so great,No
"Interface is nice, selection not so much.",No
If you‚Äôre soccer fans if you love Mexico team is perfect for you.I‚Äôm not,No
"Excellent service, but the only thing it‚Äôs I can‚Äôt record any program in ESPN ESPN 2They told me it‚Äôs temporary",No
"I love how it offers extended channels however, the price of $35 a month is pretty steep for a app that freezes terribly & buffers & lags during the shows and commercials...Basically not worth paying cable price for.",No
It would have been great but missing a network I like that would be a deal breaker,No
The volumes are different. You can‚Äôt use subtitles on every movie. The quality isn‚Äôt the best.,No
I love the content and the value.  But the app on fire TV stick is so unreliable I choose a channel it starts I choose another channel and it's just blank so I go back to the channel I was watching but now that channel is blank!  Please fix it fubotv is by far the best you can get for someone that loves soccer without a cable subscription and the entertainment channel are awesome too like el Rey and pivot.,No
Love the app and I love that it offers NFL network. But the movie section along with the shows should offer a better selection. Other than that app is great,No
Only one problem for me Fubo does not offer the Discovery channel otherwise it's perfect for me.,No
I liked all of the sports channels.I did not like the picture quality output. Seemed like 480-720p at best.Att pic quality way better!,No
Very very bad picture quality. Great idea bad execution. DirectTV streaming worked better.,No
It has the local news stations which is great. It occasionally pauses for a few seconds.,No
"Just a little problem with the picture getting blurry, but that could be the internet connection. Price is great, and my hubby can get all the football he could possibly want.",No
0 üåü! Immediate frustration. It doesn't sync with Amazon fire tv. Unistalled linked up wirh Sling which works great. Gives me what I want and for less than this app.,No
Nice app.  Not polished but nice.  Cannot watch TV while surfing the guide as you can on Vue.  Better interface than Hulu but not great channel selection.,No
"Does not yet have all major networks. other than that, it was great and we can watch our favorite sports team.",No
"Fubu offers great quality, but Priced way too high above competitors. Wilk miss Big Ten,but not worth it to me",No
"5 stars if you love soccer, I'm not a soccer fan. I tried it to see how it was for fooball and basketball, and not having ESPN was a big negative. They do have Fox, Fox Sports, and BTN.",No
Great app! Just a little pricey substitution.,No
"their app is not the greatest, they need serious upgrading!",No
Great for sports and regular primary channels!!,No
I love the value in the quality of the product and what y'all have and I love the way I love to shop on Amazon,No
Stream quality is great & easy to use.,No
"Within 1 hour of use, the application crashed and couldnt watch any of the channels. Great, -_-",No
It‚Äôs great. But it didn‚Äôt have all the local channels so I opted for another service that did.,No
It's a great streaming product for sports. With a few holes left to fill. The DVR function still needs allot of work to be used like a real DVR.,No
Like that there is a great channel lineup except my favorite network nbc. Very disappointed,No
"Easy to use, stream quality is nice",No
"Not great...  Limited selection, and lagged often.  Had to restart movies from the beginning after pausing.  This would have been high end in 2005.",No
"Soccer coverage was great, but a bit costly.",No
I love the Spanish language channels included,No
It doesn't carry Premier. Must have the best league in the world.,No
Great to keep up with f√∫tbol teams in Latin American and Spain.  I can't find these games in the regular channels (i.e. ESPN)The streaming is shaky some times,No
Service works fine on my firestick and my iphone. Great if you're a fan of futbol. There are some Uefa champions league games that are not broadcasted and none from the uefa europa league. Overall its a great app for $10 a month.,No
Love the channel guide and that I can now watch NESN without cable!Does not have local ABC (WTNH) or PBS (WEDH) stations.Audio not always in sync with video.,No
This would be great if only it had ESPN,No
Great streaming program,No
A great service with outstanding clarity for the video image.  ESPN is not in their menu is the only drawback.,No
We were able to watch football games that we not available on sling tv! Great find!,No
It's great only thing it's lacking is ABC other than that i give it 4/5 stars,No
Still trying to figure it out would love to watch church programs,No
The price is great here t there are no parental controls for the premium channel,No
Interface needs to improve.  Otherwise I love it.,No
Not that great. It don't work properly on Fire TV.,No
I love it except I wish it included ABC!!!,No
"Great comment, pricey for all access",No
This is a great alternative to Sling TV for cable TV.,No
"I am loving it. However, I would love for them to include CNN. There are MSNBC and FOX News. They must include CNN and it will be perfect",No
Fantastic but a little too expensive,No
"Love the fact that lots of channels are included, but NOT ABC! We'll have to figure out if that's a deal breaker or not. Too soon to tell.",No
It‚Äôs great just a lil to expensive,No
the only thing I can't get is channel 7 other wise everything is great,No
nice,No
Nice,No
Picture is great,No
If they could get ABC they would be perfect.,No
Excellent for sports but not great outside of them. Prefer ease of sling,No
"Great service, just need more channels at a lower price!",No
I disliked all the buffering but the selection is great!,No
almost great.  could use some local stations then it would be like basic cable i think cheaper price is a plus to cut the cord a lot better than sling definately,No
Great app,No
Not great. Lots of buffering and bad picture.,No
"Not Great , missing majority of AFCON games",No
This app it doesn't work for me! I paid for it and never can see it!!!!!  I don't like it!!,No
"An amazing app, the pictures are crisp and it is extremely friendly , I will suggest more soccer channels be added in future. I will certainly recommend this app to anyone. Once thumps up",No
"It's a great idea but it seems to need some work on stability.  I couldn't watch some futbol matches that were on my list of channels.  Also the DVR option only lets you record one match at a time.  I feel for the price of the subscription, this should be increased.  Overall, I love the idea of the app, but I am not satisfied with the quality.  They may patch it to fix these issues I have with it one day.",No
"This is the most ridiculous service. Every single channel on fuboTV buffers. Doesn't mate which channel, or which day, or what the time is. Switch over to any other streaming app - HBO, Slingtv, Directv now, YouTube, Amazon video - perfect streaming. Clearly the company don't invest in servers to keep up, so I'm off. Didn't even complete 3 days of the trial.",No
"Server went down on my first attempt at using Fubo, it remained down all night.  Received an apology email from the company regarding the widespread outage, which was nice but not anything I'd pay for.",No
nice app,No
Have had FuboTV for 6mos and I have no issues other than a few hiccups on streaming occasional. What they need to fix is their commercial programming. I have contacted them about having to watch & listen to the Dr. Dre Beats headphone commercial at every commercial break since January. The song being played is very annoying and having to hear it every 5 - 10 min is noxious at best. Their tech support weiner replied back quickly but said they have no control over the commercial programming I call B.S. as I checked multiple channels and that obnoxious commercial is being run on all of them. The next new commercial just arrived from Chili's. I won't buy Beat headphones and I won't go to Chili's just because you drive your message at me every 10min.,No
"My husband and I loved Fubo. Then someone got a hold of our password and kept kicking us off while we were watching TV. Was told to change my password and that would fix it. It didn't. So we created a new account to avoid getting kicked off, and they flagged us and blocked us from signing up for a free trial. I asked if we could proceed without the free trial, as we are willing to continue paying for the service, and I was told we were blocked from signing up ever again. A little disappointed considering we loved Fubo and would love to continue paying for the service.",No
"Got this for the World Cup, 2018. Absolutely awful service.Never had any problems streaming HD, I have a 100MB cable connection, Netflix, Amazon etc. all work great.Fubo however:-Constant steaming issues, pauses, blurs, complete crapouts-Doesn't work with my privacy VPN-Commercials on all the shows and films-Stupid expensive",No
"Watching subscribed Fubo Cycling. Complained to Fubo about them taking my subscription fee and interrupting broadcast  with commercials. I was advised that their marketing team choose the best time to play commercial so as to minimize interruption.  Insane! Not an apology to be found!Worse, for current Giro d'Italia broadcast, Fubo is putting opaque commercial sponsor banner on screen for last 10kms of race with message their sponsor is bringing the last of the race commercial free!! They leave the banner up through out the finish with the banner blocking parts of the race!",No
Meh. As with any app Fubo makes it incredibly tough to leave feedback. Trust me you should do a trial and see if you can leave feedback 1.  2. You can‚Äôt scroll through any programs. 3. Reliability as far as continuing to watching from the last place you left off from fails. It‚Äôs expensive. Netflix won‚Äôt let you down. Maybe consider something else for now until this app improves. Big fail on just the UI or consistency would be nice. Unless it improves the next few times I use the app I‚Äôm out.,No
"Constant buffering, blurry, fuzzy, low Rez disconnections, stalled shows. I have YouTube TV too and very same show at the very same time comes in great. My internet speed is super fast. Customer service is VERY responsive but no fix.",No
"The worst customer service i have ever seen on hold for 25 minutes only to get cut off repeatedly by the robot non-sense, the stream was poor at best do yourself best stay away from this company. Getting a real person is impossible.",No
I didn't get any heads up about the change in channels and charges until today when changes take place... I will be cancelling my service that wasn't all the great to begin with!!!! We don't get any appreciation!!!,No
the idea is great but they need better servers... its always freezing and you cant watch anything,No
"Now that Hulu increased it's price, you're the better deal. The extra DVR is great with 500 hours to fast forward when ever. Sometimes trouble loading On-demand,or recorded shows and you have to re-load 3 times to get them to play.  No ABC, or ESPN.  Otherwise I love the set ups for the live TV guide and easy to use system.",No
Great for watching soccer in Europe and does stream all UCL and Europa league games. Price is kind of steep for the channels provided. Needs more channels.,No
It great,No
Great,No
I am not sure how to rate the item. We were hoping to be able to watch ESPN2 sports to watch my son play soccer at the University he is attending however despite our efforts we were unsuccessful.  We returned it for this reason but I am sure it is great for other channel viewing.,No
More free content would be nice,No
Great,No
It says movies and TV but an incredible limited source .. perfect for the avid sports enthusiast,No
"My only issue with this app is that every time you click on an event, it makes you watch a 30 second ad. This is just a little annoying, especially when you know you are missing stuff. But otherwise, this is a great app. It offers the main sporting events that NBC has, like Sunday Night Football, hockey, etc. Additionally, it offers some unusual sports, like various tournaments (tennis, badminton, Esports, luge) as well as the Olympic and Golf channels. Lastly, it offers highlights, interview, and other short videos. Oh, and replays of full events. Just a note: a lot of unpopular sports do not have commentary or even sound equipment, so don't be thrown off when the World Billiards Tournament Game is silent. Also, you do have to have a corresponding TV subscription.",No
"It did work great before NBCSN decided they wanted to push this gold sub package and new app version. Ever since I cant stream the content clearly using the firestick, constantly buffering and out of focus. Same content streams flawless on my pc and apple tv legacy (3rd gen). So its the app on the firestick that is the issue. I hope it gets fixed. Really disappointing app right now, makes streaming racing in my office or game room a non-starter. Its not my bandwidth with a 500 MB UL/DL connection and flawless 4k from Disney+, Amazon Prime video, and Netflix. The video issues are all with the app that has been updated and pushed to the firestick. The firestick does many things well, but this app is not one of them. I dont know how much control they have over it but if I could roll back to the original version of the app I would.Just fix it.",No
"The South Koreans apparently did an excellent job of hosting and producing the games. The opening ceremony was awesome and the venues seemed to be world class.  However, the NBC coverage, seemed more focused on celebrating the NBC announcers, network, and commentators. NBC seems to have forgotten that it was about sports and  the athletes and constantly injected politics, social issues, and overstated crises with the games or athletes. NBC seemed to repeatedly ignore the immense accomplishments and hard work of the many Olympic athletes from many countries. They blew it by not covering some key races and devoting time to too many fluff segments (e.g Today Show hosts learning how to ski. ). Hopefully, ABC, CBS, or FOX will provide the coverage next time.",No
"I installed the app, signed onto my service provider and everything was working great.The next time I tried to login, i just get the ""Error An error has occurred"" message and can't do anything.  I did everything that was recommended,  resetting the Fire TV Cube, clearing the data/cache, and fore stopping the App.Seems to be a consistent problem and the only known solution online is to do a hard reset on the device.  That is terrible.  Works fine on Playstation and Apple TV....",No
"Cord cutter here. I see an NFL game advertised on NBC. Great matchup. I download the app to watch the game. The app lets me watch approximately a half-hour's worth of pregame coverage before cutting out and telling me to enter my cable provider information. Holy Sh*t. What an absolutely ridiculous system you've come up with, NBC. If I had a cable subscription I wouldn't use the app, nor would I have Amazon Fire TV. Who is the marketing whiz who came up with this utterly boneheaded business plan? Jesus, just charge $5 a month for your app & let people buy your content a la carte. This is infuriating and worthless. Do you guys not want to make money? Your app is totally worthless and unnecessary and your business model is seriously flawed. Get with the times. Another disappointed customer...",No
"NBC could not care less about their streaming app or the people who pay to watch it's content. Words cannot describe my hatred of NBC Sports and this application but I will try, for the people. First off, it is so full of bugs and glitches that it makes for a truly frustrating watching experience. There is no escape, however, as they have you by the balls owning the exclusive rights to some of the best sporting available.  You will have to sign in and verify your credentials to the app so many times, I have nbcsports.com/activate as one of my most visited websites. Once you've gained access to the content you willing pay for it gets even better. There is nothing quite like waking up at 7am eastern standard time to watch some Premier League football only to have the app tell you it is unable to play this asset over and over again. If you are watching a sport that a decent amount of commercial breaks be prepared to have quick cuts to those commercials, so quick in fact that parts of the game will be cut off.  Also be prepared to see the exact same commercials for an entire year/season. You will be reciting the Liberty Mutual ads by heart in no time. Games will lag so far behind normal game time that you have to actively avoid your phone to not see spoilers. To be clear this not an internet speed issue as I pay for decent download/upload speeds. If you love sports you will find this app as a necessary evil, but it will suck out as much of your soul as possible and then charge you the NBC Gold price doing so.",No
"The live stream is terrible for big events. It kept buffering and dropping out during the Superbowl, while it operated perfectly during the 6 hours of pregame coverage. For an app that is not free I would expect the stream to be (mostly) clean. I wouldn't bother paying for this app until they can improve the live stream, which sports are heavily reliant on.",No
"I love the Premier League on nbcsports, and SF Giants games, especially on the firestick. It is HD and my comcast is not. I also love the replays. It's fantatic.However I have 2 complaints. 1. There are too many ads in the replays. We wanted to watch US Ice Skating replay and there were so many ads I decided it was not worth it. That defeats the purpose of the ads. And, 2., I have to reactivate it too often to watch replays. I'll get a notice saying I'm not a subscriber even though I'm logged in. I have to sign out,and resign in, by going to nbcsports.com/active and type in a code This is an irritating ""feature"".  Overwall, I still love the PL and quality of shows and otherwise ease of use.",No
"It‚Äôs a well laid out app with lots of content. Picture quality is excellent. I have it 3 stars because while it‚Äôs a great app, I couldn‚Äôt access the channel/content that I wanted to. My tv provider is SlingTV and I have NBCSports in my package. The Sunday‚Äôs Nascar Race came on Sling but I missed it and forgot to record. On the Nascar page, they said that the race came on NBC and if I wanted to stream the race I could do so on the NBC app OR the NBCSports app. So I download NBCSports app and I enter my tv provider. The race is on there but I can‚Äôt access it. It tells me there is an authentication error. I decide to try the NBCSports Track Pass because it appears that I‚Äôll have access to all the Nascar stuff, including the Nascar Cup Series....but I don‚Äôt. So I went thru all that just to try and watch the Nascar Cup Series Race and couldn‚Äôt. I was very annoyed. The app really deserves 5 stars but that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm giving it 3.",No
"I love the olympics. But NBC‚Äôs algorithm of when commercials will play will suck the life our of you. It‚Äôs totally off and I hope you like seeing the same 5 commercials over and over again. Bright side: stream is clear and servers haven‚Äôt crashed on me. But after seeing a Toyota commercial for the 7,346,568th time, I think im going to stay away from buying a Toyota. Sorry Toyota. Im sure your cars are great.",No
We are happy to have the app to watch some sports.2 things re: user interface- it would be great when logging in to a series if it automatically went back to what we were watching rather than having to navigate through the whole app again-it would be nice fast forwarding to be able to see the image rather that just the time with fast forwarding.  We are using a Firestick,No
I have never subscribed to cable and live in an area that does not receive any broadcast television. But now my best friend lives around the corner and she likes to watch the Patriots. We were so happy to be able to stream Thursday's game through the Fire stick even though we expected it to be available with Prime.The stream did hang up a couple times and some times we got some pretty low resolution. I'd like to see more diversity in the advertising. Hopefully advertisers will realize us cable cutters will stream games. I'd even pay a small amount to continue to have few commercials and more content.,No
sure needs improving. I had a hard time finding what I wanted to see and then if I had to turn it off for awhile it would not start where I left off. so had to fast forward several hours worth of video. I havent been able to watch the last several Oympics because I could never figure out when what I wanted to watch was coming on so having it on line has been very nice and maybe in four years it can be improved.,No
"We downloaded the app but when we tried to use it, you have to sign in with your tv provider.  Well we use an antenna, that we bought off amazon and love, however, there is no option for that.  We also have Philo, Netflix and Prime.  None of those were offered.  Don't know what I am doing wrong, but it isn't working for us.",No
"Watched the superbowl via the NBC Sports app on our firestick. 4 stars for letting a program that big be free. It was awesome that they provided a live stream for no cost. Most companies wouldn't dream of doing that, so I was very impressed. That said, we had it running on another tv at the same time pulling from an actual cable company and the NBC app was significantly behind, by like 30 mintues or so, so that was a bit of a let down. But again, it was free, so I'm not complaining. Just a little inconvenience when you want to have it running in two rooms at once (living room + kitchen). I'll continue to use the NBC app though as long as it stays free like this. Thanks, NBC and Amazon!!",No
"The Olympic Games represent the highest accomplishments of the athletes who have made it to these games in Brazil. As a native South American, I am tremendously proud of these games being held in the continent of my birth and, as far as I have witnessed, the great success that is being accomplished by the host country. I'm very appreciative of the coverage which is available on NBC Sports through my Amazon Five TV service and I am able to follow all of my favorite sports through this brilliant service. This is by far the best streaming service I have in my home at the moment.",No
"Obtained to watch Super Bowl. It was advertised that one could watch the Super Bowl using this app. Day of the game, the app only displayed a ‚Äútechnical difficulties‚Äù message throughout the duration of the game; though, I could watch soccer in Great Britain at that time via this ap.  Very very much a rip-off. And I can‚Äôt help but wonder how intentional it was. Won‚Äôt be purchasing any of NBCs products again. I found a way to watch it through a different means. BTW, had the same issues with the HULU ap.",No
"The complete and total bias of the ""expert"" commentators, especially Chris Collinsworth, was absolutely reprehensible!!!!!!!!!  I wanted to watch the game, with no preference either way of what team won.  The butt-kissing  of the Patriots, and Collinsworth's love affair with Tom Brady was sickening!  At one point, Brady seriously underthrew a pass and Collinsworth remarked that he ""did it on purpose"".  I may be a girl, but I grew up in Cleveland and I KNOW FOOTBALL!!!!!!!!  From the comments on all of social media, I am far from the only one!!!  Commentators at a high school football game are more professional.  This was a GLOBALLY televised game.  NBC should be ashamed!!!!!!",No
I am truly happy that I do not have to buy a full cable package. So that I can enjoy bike racing around the season.But the TDU was spotty at best not able to access the a given race that day but playback was not available till the following day.Coverage commentators  and picture were almost flawless also distance from that continent may have caused problems. I Miss Paul------------,No
"love watching Premier league soccer on this ,but frustrating when you have to keep logging on with an existing cable tv account (I use my son's account) to watch. great for the games, drives you nuts to see the same d---m commercials to the point that I actually hate the products and people when they are between games or events",No
"We love Alpine World Cup skiing! However, we will not be renewing because we prefer our events commentated.  We can watch on the Olympic Channel rather than paying $$$ for this app.",No
Let me start out by saying amazon shows are awesome I just watched Goliath its a great show as was patriot . but I tried to connect to nbc sports thru amazon and I couldn't do it. Personally I think if amazon had the contract for the Olympics they would of done a much better job . Just saying.,No
"NOT FOR CABLE CUTTERS! - Requires contract with a TV provider and still displays ads. - Does not offer subscription for only this content, must have a provider.  Nice for the short free preview it gives but ultimately not worth downloading...",No
"So sad. Just trying to figure out how to watch our local MLB team without cable.  And we still cannot.  App may be great. It just doesn‚Äôt meet our needs.MLB live won‚Äôt show in market teams, so it‚Äôs not worth it. But we‚Äôve known that for years.Time for a better AM antenna, I guess.",No
"A great place to watch the Nation‚Äôs team compete at the Olympics, if you pay for it. A great place to tey and cram all your replays into 30 minutes, unles you pay for it. Tax money is spent to send teams to the Olympics so pay your fair share to see them compete. (Thumbs down and long raspberry)",No
"Seriously, people who want an app like this mostly want it because we cut ties with the big money hungry cable services. But you cannot USE this app unless you DO subscribe to one of them. This is ridiculous at best, and a waste of time. If you have a Firestick only, don't bother with this download. Complete POS.",No
I started watching it on the Smarttv by Samsung it kept breaking up and the sound was not synchronized. I went to my bedroom and turned it on with the Fire Stick. It worked perfect. I would rate it a 5 Star. The Samsung would be a 3- so I averaged the two experiences.,No
"It would be nice if they told you had to have a cable TV provider for this to work. What is the point of having a Firestick if you have cable?I was led to believe this app would allow me to watch the Olympics, NOT the case!I live in an area where cable isn't available, after talking with troubleshooting techs I was told I could subscribe to Sling TV and pay their $25 package and watch all events live. Nope, still need a TV provider and a code to make it work.I would rate a zero if that would have been an option. Very misleading!",No
"This was one of the weakest strems I've paid for. Usability was a challenge. When it stopped showing the main competition, it went to still shots and it was hard to know where things were in the competition next. There was only background sound. The interface was very large on the best of equipment, even with commercial internet from my business. When Supercross went to NBC with this program it lost a lot of viewers and I understand why.",No
"I got as far as downloading the app after trying other places to stream. I couldn't believe the charges to watch a game. I don't really get into it for the entire season so it's silly to spend so much. It would be nice to spend 5-10 bucks to watch while I fold kids clothes....anyway, I never used it, I have no opinion.",No
"It worked great for the first 90 minutes I watched. I couldnt find the system to select to send the code to.( I tried to find ""Amazon, Firestick, Alexa"")",No
"using it for the Olympics and find the process awkward. The highlights and full event items are not listed in newest first order, so I constantly have to scroll across to get to the most recent events. When watching a series of clips, sometimes the app sends me back to the first one in the list instead of continuing forward. Some events have no commentary which is either nice, or difficult if you want to really understand what is going on. It is fair but not fantastic. I feel a little let down.",No
This channel is not that great. They play games by carrying some of the games and not the rest. So you have to purchase another channel. Would not recommend.,No
"I realize it's a ""free"" app, but a commercial every other minute?  And the same commercial time after time?  It makes it hard to watch the events, especially fast paced ones. And the fact that you have to have an actual cable subscription limits its use tremendously for those of us who choose not to have cable (that's why I have a Firestick and Internet after all). However, the reminder feature is nice and it's a fairly easy app to navigate.",No
"NBC needs to fix this app. It keeps crashing, and each time the only way to fix it is to completely reset my firestick (even wiping the data from the app and re-installing it doesn't work). Then I have to re-download all the apps onto the firestick. When it's working it's fine; I pay for NBC Sports Gold so I can watch Premier League games, and it's great for that. But it crashes fairly often and then everything has to be wiped and reset.",No
"Great perk to be able to watch the Super Bowl when I do not have cable.  THANKS NBC !  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because there was several times when the network was unavailable.  The message stated ""returning momentarily"".",No
"this app is just plain horrible.  What happened to me last night is a regular occurrence for anything I watch.Rangers vs. Sabers hockey game.  Great, I'm from ny but live out of the area.  The app continuously buffers every 10 minutes for a period of 5-10 minutes.  It usually continues where it left off, however it will also catch up and poof end of the game, or missed goal.This happens all the time.",No
"I love the soccer coverage in fact it's the only reason I subscribe, however I understand the need for ads. But the same ad over and over again is very irritating, especially at half time to the point we actually turn the tv off during intermition",No
While I love this app on my phone and tablet it did not have access on Spectrum.  PRIME did not help for this one.,No
"The NBC Sports for FIRETV app stability could be improved by a lot. Although the video quality is amazing, the stream often drops and almost every time after an ad, the app just crashes an goes back to the beginning of video out of nowhere. This could get very annoying when this happens over and over again. I would give the app 5 star without doubt if the app was not crashing so frequently after fast forwarding or advertisement.",No
Their fast forward rewind feature is very lacking in comparison to other streaming platforms. It's also frustrating to have to fast forward through commercial breaks without any idea how long they are or what part of the broadcast you are fast forwarding through. Streaming quality is great. I really like being able to purchase a subscription for only the programs I want.,No
We loved the NBC Gold..We purchased it to watch the PLL..It streamed fantastic..picture quality was great.. Definitely worth it..,No
"It's NBC's attempt to do an app.  They're making progress, and I'll say at least this one was usable, which is a big step up from the 2014 Olympics.  Maybe in the 2020s they'll have it perfected enough to earn 5 stars.",No
Clunky interface. Packages are expensive. Hasn't been updated in forever. Like being to made to randomly re-login again and again? Awesome! Forces you to constantly see and deal with sports you don't care about. No way to hide. Video clips only with no easy way to search or organize. Consise information about your sport? Forget about it. Could've been so much more...,No
I used it to watch the Daytona 500 the coverage of was excellent except for pit road where when problems came up for the team's there was a lack up dates or coverage,No
Well let‚Äôs start with Super Bowl Sunday.  I recently signed up for xfinity and they lost channel five!!  We were sitting here with people coming for the game and a lot of food and know game. I realized that I had amazon prime and the fire stick!  Found NBC and loaded it. I got to watch the game and other than the refreshing it was great!  Thank you amazon and NBC you made a bad moment into a great day!  You just inherited a fan!,No
"The app plays NBC Sports Bay Area just fine, great for watching Giants baseball on the go. The problem is NBC inserts the same commercials from Honda and McDonalds into every commercial break, and the commercials are at least twice as loud as the broadcast.",No
"It was a great way to watch the olympics. It did freeze every once in awhile but over all it worked really well. I liked how it had all the sports listed at the bottom of the page and I could choose what sport to watch, even the ones that aren't as popular.",No
"Great to have the feed anywhere I have a connection. It was choppy and looped at times, but I‚Äôm not entirely sure that that was do to the app or my WiFi connection. Glad to have it for the Super Bowl and upcoming Olympics.",No
The filming is fantastic but female reporter Donaldson said shameful remark to Canadian female curler when she accidentally made an error that was t even a penalty. She said ‚Äú...she needs to go to the eye doctor for better vision‚Äù. Very poor on national TV.Also too much reporting on US athletes. I watched the summary reviews and other nations that came in 1st were not shown. Other countries report more equally.,No
"Not to happy with them!My wife and I love the ice dancing and figure skating and guess what , NBC put it on their cable channels which I don't get . Others have said the same thing ,greed ,greed ,greed and nothing live ,  I do like to watch either way but when your phone or the news lets you know a day ahead ,well it sucks .Ps ,why do I have to listen to a Aussie lady and not American commentator ?",No
"Tried to use app during the Olympics and it was absolute garbage.  Froze every two seconds, and then would buffer.  And buffer.  And buffer.  I have an excellent internet package as well, so I know it wasn't my internet.  Ended up barely watching anything of them due to the low quality of this app.",No
I LOVE the fact that I can watch NBC so easily on my Element Fire TV; I just despise every aspect of NBC.  I would pay to watch the Olympics if any other network on Earth were showing them.,No
It was a great way to watch a football game on Fire Stick.,No
"I was GREAT to be able to see the Super Bowl Live & for Free by Streaming!!!  However, I was Very Disappointed with the amount of Buffering!!!  I have the Fastest Comcast/Xfinity internet available... Acording to Speedtest it is 119 Mbps...  I'm just glad that the NBC Sports app on Amazon was Free!!!",No
I love it but  I cannot get it to go full force the codes don't work for me,No
A bit slow and not the best quality but easy to navigate,No
"Many complained about cutting the cord but with the Olympics, I was able to watch the sports I was interested in and not just what the US channels covered because of US athlete's. Makes it nice to pick your sport and also has full replays of missed events. No complaints. Enjoy what sports you want to watch on YOUR terms!!",No
I was watching America's Cup coverage on Tuesday June 6th -- it was great.Tried to watch at 1pm on Wednesday 7th and it would not open up -- had to watch it on my iPhone NBC Sports App and send to my TV using Apple TV.,No
"Got this app to watch the Vegas Golden Knights hockey games. The puck is very hard to keep track of, there were 2 pucks during alot of the stream as the quality wasn't great for me.",No
"It was working great for a couple days, now it won‚Äôt let me watch videos because brighthouse is having technical difficulties. This has been going on for two days. Now I‚Äôm loosing interest in watching the olympics",No
"This use to be a great app, but now it's just filled with annoying ads.  Imagine watching the olympics and an ad for horrible McDonald's McNuggets (that no one should eat anyway) coming on in the middle of a dive, gymnastic routine, etc...  NBC and the advertisers should be ashamed of themselves.",No
"I've now tried with three different firesticks.  The app works perfectly after the initial install.  After turning off the television and then re-opening the app, it just produces an error message.  Searched online and it seems to be a very common issue that has been around for a long time with no solution.  Fix the app!",No
"Multiple attempts to sync to Spectrum for service agreement failed.  Long periods of dead air due to the tv commercial time outs.  Time where nothing is happening and you can't tell if there is an issue with the feed or the app.  Other apps run great with no pauses for buffering, this app buffers constantly on same equipment.",No
"It's nice to be able to choose from multiple live events, but the app is constantly buffering. Once the buffering is over, the feed continues from the freezing point(no longer live). Occasionally the buffering just never ends, so I exit out and come back in to the same feed, but now I've missed several minutes because of the constant buffering/resuming.",No
Doesn't tell you that you only get 30 minutes of watch time unless you enter a code through your TV provider. Not great for those of us who have cut the cable or satellite cord and just wanted to catch some of the Olympics they missed.,No
"Great product, will recommend it!",No
Perfect for watching sports,No
"You would think a company like NBC would have their streaming down.  Too bad it is terrible.  We would have loved to watch the Olympics - we don't even mind the commercials, but when that is all you get to watch there is no point in having the app.",No
"Supposedly I have this app for my Firestick but when I try to access the Olympics a message appears on my tv telling me ""your subscription package doesn't include this programming.""  I even got an email from Amazon telling me how I could download this great app so I wouldn't have to miss any of the Olympics.",No
Because of the BLM crap I will not be watching Pro Sports. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!,No
It is a great app to have to get some of the Olympics but disappointing because you can't watch them anytime. The events we have tried are either concluded or not showing now. It would be better if you could watch any event anytime rather than have to watch them live.,No
Buffers or freezes every few minutes. Always seems to be a commercial at random times or right when there‚Äôs about to be a big play. Wish these networks would put out quality apps with the seemingly endless budgets they have. Amazon streaming is the best out of all them.,No
Works wonderfully,No
"Great to watch the Olympics... Well sort of because there was soooo many ads! Don't know what's worse. You tune in to watch ad,  ad after a few minutes. Ad when you switch to a different sport etc.",No
This NBC Gold would be great for me. I could watch golf on my Fire Stick TV.,No
There seems to be a lot of lag in Olympic coverage but I love the features!,No
Awesome,No
WE HAVE THE AMAZON FIRE STICK AND IT'S NOT THE BEST. IT STALLS A LOT.  SO HAVING THE APP REALLY HELPS. ALL THOUGH WE DIDN'T GET TO WATCH THE LAST 30 SECONDS OF THE SUPER BOWL.  APP STALLED TOO.,No
"This is one of those bad Apps which require you to have a subscription to a cable service / provider, not that there isn't any content, just that what's available is not the best.  I actually have a subscription to NBC Sports through my laptop but that's pretty useless here.",No
Love live streaming. Wish it were easier to surf other programs on NBC networks.,No
They did a great job. I may use this more often.,No
Never used this but I'm sure its great,No
It was nice to be able to watch the Super Bowl for free but it was a nightmare to stream it. It  constantly stopped streaming and the app had to be closed out and reset to continue to watch.,No
Sometimes Didn‚Äôt work great,No
I‚Äôd love to watch actually reporting and not commentary by non athletes,No
Great,No
"It would be great if it didn‚Äôt periodically close on me, forcing me to re-access the app and wait a few minutes for the broadcast to resume. The features and quality are decent. I just wish it wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúcut out‚Äù on me so much.",No
watching different programs is great if the streaming is a lot better. jumps all over and never stays on program without buffering at least every 5 minutes. espn I have hardly any buffering issues. nbc streaming ??? figure it out !!!,No
"Have the tv service so that's not the problem (that's just common sense, the tv providers are not going to offer FREE tv...) my problem is the terrible quality. Perfectly fine with internet and connections, but NBC can't figure out how to correctly stream a game for 5 minutes without it buffering or loading",No
"I live in a remote part of Vermont that has pathetically slow internet. I tried, or rather endlessly buffered, live streaming the Superbowl on other sites but NBC Sports worked well and the coverage was great. Very happy (except for the Patriots performance). Will definitely be watching the Olympics on NBC Sports.",No
"First time I used it for Superbowl coverage. Overall decent. Only showed 1 or 2 commercials from superbowl, the great ones we wait for. That's a con bad thing I didn't like. Plus game was on there but clips than pauses. Should stream it live live. The whole thing",No
"For those of us who have cut the cable (or dish) and gotten the Fire TV, this app is worthless. It would have been nice to watch the main NBC channel during the Olympics, but not even that seems to be possible.",No
"I love the wide variety of Olympic sports we can watch at any time. Unfortunately, the segments constantly pause to load which is annoying as hell. It often won‚Äôt load the app at all when you try to launch it and you have to ‚ÄúRetry‚Äù multiple times before it starts finally.",No
"This app is a nice idea for the Olympics, lots of coverage on there. You have to log in with your cable provider, no problem there. However, the viewer is clunky, it's almost impossible to fast forward AND ypthere's literally a commercial every 5 minutes and they are the same commercials. The IOS app did not have so many commercial. Please improve this app!",No
My husband loves football and NBC Sports delivered the wildcard football game last week. As long as we can see NFL football on this app I will keep it,No
"Love the convenience (my friends are jealous that I can choose to watch the equestrian events whenever I want).  Love that it's complete coverage, not just the blip or two you might get lucky enough to catch live.  Not cool that it freezes up a lot and you can't just pick up where you left off if you can't watch all 3-4 hours of a segment in one sitting (otherwise, it would be 5-star).",No
I would say the app works perfect but it doesn‚Äôt. My boyfriend and I were watching an intense football game the other night and it just stopped working on us. Eventually it got to the point where it wouldn‚Äôt reload either and we couldn‚Äôt finish watching the game or anything else on the app either. Very disappointed.,No
"Lots of options, but the app itself is quite terrible. Quality is poor. Lots of buffering and freezing.I have 60mbsp down so would think bandwidth isn't a problem. If worked well app would be great.",No
For sports lovers I recommend it,No
Great app for the fire stick tv - love the highlights,No
"I would actually give less than that if I could.... Where I can see the potential to be a great app, it falls off the grid short for people that probably actually need it... You have to have a TV service provider to use it to watch full video of the Olympics ... If I had a tv provider then I wouldn't need the app!!!.... I have yet to see any of the Olympics this year and the first time in my life that I have ever missed them!",No
"NBC Sports offers great content & coverage.  However, my reception has been spotty.  It could be the antenna.",No
"For such a great product as they state, when your on a fixed VA budget, paying for something that should be free is rediculous....  I have to give 1 star because I have to, not because I want to....",No
Super glitchy.  Couldn't even make it through single drive without glitching out. My internet service is fast and other apps work great.,No
Excellent programing!!,No
With cable provider this works great.,No
"Tends to be buggy, but it streams HQ. Loading time is on the longer side for the streams, but once you get it going, it doesnt drop or lag. Can stream the nbc, nbc sports or bravo broadcast. Can also do a la carte broadcast (things that are not on TV). It might be slightly behind the live tv version, but hey, if you dont have cable or want to watch things not being broadcasted live on TV, then this is your best bet!",No
I'm sure the broadcast is great - I just couldn't get it to work on FIRE tv.  Frustrating!,No
If I could actually stream a whole game without having to back out and go back in or having the app crash every 5 minutes it would be awesome,No
"Nice app.  My only complaint is the rewind/fast forward function.  It would be nice to see what I am speeding past so I know when to hit play again.  Other than that I am 100% satisfied.  BTW, your Indy Car coverage is fantastic !  Thank you.",No
I have great internet all of my other apps work fine. This app does a lot of clocking,No
Not what I call as sports lover liking to choose.,No
only downloaded it for olympics. I'm sure avid sports people would love this,No
love it,No
"Apps are the best to watch sports. Resolution is crystal clear, broadcast tv can‚Äôt come close to the clarity",No
"I love that I can watch games on my FireTV, but a little disappointed that I can't on my mobile device.",No
"it was nice to watch the thursday night football game on the amazon fire TV. However, the game was spotty and seemed to buffer a lot, it finally just quit loading and we turned off the game. Frustrating for a football game.",No
"A great app for watching the same 4 commercials on repeat, occasionally interrupted with a sporting event.  Also, it experiences lots of buffering in less than ideal conditions (like hotel wifi), but in the same circumstances Amazon video and Netflix worked fine.",No
This app was great for watching the Winter games! Loved how you could see replays.! The buffing was annoying but that could have just been Comcast issue,No
I'm sure its great if you subscribe to cable.  Make it available to people who dont have cable.. Otherwise just watch OTA,No
I would give it negative stars if they were available. Crappy interface. Buggy. Won't launch half the time. I deleted and downloaded 3 times. Always need to retry. No schedules. Can't get the pre recorded events to play.  NBC blew a great chance to shine.,No
It did a great deal of buffering. Disappointing.,No
"Obviously, the Olympics are great. Without Katie Couric, it would have been 5 stars.",No
Great,No
"Some content has buffering problems and I've been kicked off multiple times in the middle of streaming, but it is a great way to watch all of the Olympic sports since I've joined the cable cutters!",No
"It was great until it got stuck spinning on the finals of the women's slope style last night. My internet was working fine.. so not sure what why it wouldn't stream... ?  It's much better than watching regular TV, however, ... But it really needs to work all the time.",No
App would be great if live sports didn't glitch and buffer every time. Increase the capacity!!!,No
I love sports!,No
"You have to have an account with a provider to use this app, would be nice to say this before you download.",No
"Great to be able to stream live sports. Had a few hang times during programming, though.",No
"The whole point of FireTV is not to pay crazy cable prices. So why have an app that you can't watch, unless you have a cable subscription. THIS IS THE DUMBEST THING THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!",No
great place to watch a race when nbc messes up its own schedule of events...,No
Worked great.,No
"Loved watching the Olympics Opening Ceremony without all the annoying commentary!!!Streaming sometimes glitchy, but overall a much better option than most live broadcasts of the olympics thus far.",No
Better menus would be nice but works pretty well for me.,No
Shame on NBC....Prematurely launched this app.My husband was set to watch The British Open...but many streams are blocked by Parental Control messages. (We have NO controls set up). Spent an hour and a half with Amazon Fire TV tech support-they are amazing!!!!!!  But still unable to watch live streams.Very disappointing.,No
It was great to get to watch the game as we only have the fire stick & no satellite. The only problem was a continuous buffering every 2-3 min. Hoping to use it to watch the Olympics as well!,No
App downloaded fine and worked great for about a day then stopped working I tried to get back into it with all passwords etc and it won't take.  I'm locked out,No
"It was nice to have the Superbowl on our second TV, but the streaming was about 4 minutes behind cable; therefore nobody wanted to watch that  TV.",No
Shaun White - bestNot enough coverage - worst,No
Wonderful Item Works Great.,No
Love having the ability to watch all of the Olympics not just what the American stations want us to. App works fine outside of a few pauses.,No
I would have probably loved it. But it wanted me to put in a code and what service i have well I use Amazon prime. And I couldn't watch it. So made me really upset...,No
"I have had many problems with this program, I guess it may be my provider's fault. In spite of the problems the image quality is excellent.",No
"I'm disappointed with the quality of the feed. HD? Movies, shows and other channels are clear and crisp but for some reason this app isn't. My internet speed is excellent. ??",No
It was great to watch the Olympics given I did not have cable however it would play for about 20 minutes and then the screen would go blank and I would have to restart the whole app.,No
Best sports channel ever.,No
Free Superbowl coverage was nice.  But the app constantly froze and skipped half of the superbowl commercials.,No
Added this during the Olympics. Great coverage. That's the only time I watch sports!,No
Some content is blocked when using Spectrum (Charter) Cable. Would be nice if blocked content was flagged before clicking.Would be even nicer if the children running NBC and Spectrum would play ball with each other ...like they do in the Olympics.,No
Really bad buffering and speeds. Used NFL and things were great which tells me its not my internet service.,No
Picture quality could have been better.  Probably 720p at best. But was glad to watch a game with the Amazon Firestick vs fighting for cable box.,No
great item fast ship,No
"Great idea, would love to use it but can't get it working. Just keeps saying it needs to reauthenticate. Even after doing so a dozen times still won't work finally gave up...",No
"In 3 hour continuous play during a live SNF game, the app shut off at least 6 or 7 times. Frustrating at best",No
"Great way to watch Olympics. Waaay too many ads, not-to-mention the same ads over and over again.",No
"It has some issues, not that great",No
Not great for watching the olympics highlights.,No
"Works great, just as advertised.  Installing APPS can be difficult, but likely the same for all such systems.  Video and audio quality is excellent.  FF or REW is a little slow and not easy to control.",No
"Great app for watching the Olympics. Only thing is you have to have a paid cable/satellite tv provider in order to use the app fully, otherwise you only get a few minutes to watch. Too bad since not everyone uses a paid tv provider.",No
I thought it was going to give free live sports but it only let me view part of the game. Picture quality was great though.,No
Love it,No
Great way to pick what Olympic sport you want to watch instead of those Bob Costus thinks you should watch!!,No
It was free to watch the Super Bowl which was nice. But stream had to keep buffering. Announcers were obviously patriots fans instead of letting the officials do their jobs.,No
"Great app but lacking. I am huge cycling fan and my schedule does not allow me to watch the tour DE France live, but there is no ability to watch the full broadcast after the fact. I don't want just highlights, I want to watch the stages play out",No
"Worked as described, great to watch Olympics",No
Nice,No
Love this application but just three stars until 4K Ultra HD implementation,No
Great app with all of the Olympic sports I could imagine watching right there at my fingertips. The interface is a little less user friendly than I'd hoped but nothing too terrible.,No
"I am conflicted. Coverage and commentators are great (5 stars), web site is difficult to navigate (2 stars).",No
"Perfect, works great! No problems.",No
"While it streams great once it does decide to work, the app itself is horrendous.  It freezes for at least 5 minutes upon opening and then scrolls itself through 600 streaming choices without ever pushing a button.  I am unable to scroll through the choices within the application.  Very disappointing.",No
Great show,No
Love the amount of viewing options. The app is VERY slow to load and frequently stops to buffer .,No
"Nice,  on point",No
"easy to download but runs slow, stops and buffers, not a great app and not relable but when it is working it is nice to watch.",No
This WAS a great app.Not they make you pay extra for game that were free just 2 months ago.Dumb to have to switch between 2 apps to watch different games. Poorly thought out,No
I was super excited this came up to be able to watch the Super Bowl live and even host a party! The best part is that it was free!,No
easy to get but not all that great,No
"Would love to give them more stars, but we weren't able to watch past 30 minutes due to not having a cable subscription. We pay for internet service through AT&T, but apparently that's just not enough money for them to allow us to watch more than 30 minutes. I blame both NBC and AT&T for their inability to offee a free stream option.",No
Great app!!!,No
I got this for my roommate; I am not a sports fan. She might love it!,No
"I have a Fire TV stick because I cut the cable cord. Amazon sent me an email today that I could watch the olympics by simply downloading the NBC Sports app for free! Hooray! Except I need a cable subscription in order to watch it. Boo! You think with the amount I pay Comcast for internet every month they could let something like this slide every once in a while. So nice to have Comcast intenet, but not really be part of the Comcast ""family"". I deleted the stupid app.",No
If you don‚Äôt mind more commercials then actual sports then it‚Äôs great.,No
nice to have few sports - live - I haven't viewed it enough to know what's what yet. I'll keep trying.,No
"I've only used it to live stream the gymnastics, which worked perfectly fine for me.",No
Works great in our RV,No
Nice,No
I enjoy being able to watch free highlights of the Olympics! Quick commercials and great HD quality.,No
You have to have a cable subscription to watch.  Not great for those of us who don‚Äôt wanrcable.,No
Not eligible in my area for some reason. Works great on my Android but does not work on the fire tv,No
Perfect for my Amaz stick,No
A little slow to switch between sports but great access to the Olympics.,No
"I think it's great that they offer this app during the olympics.  I just wish those who have internet access didn't get denied access simply because we don't have a cable subscription.  If it wasn't for my parents, I wouldn't be able to use this app.",No
"I believe it would be an amazing app but, when I went to watch WNT Olympic qualifier live it said it wasn't available by my provider when I had already signed in. Completely disappointed.",No
Not the greatest app,No
Used it to watch a football game worked well very little issues. The quality was great we will use it again.,No
"NBC Olympic App: I wish it wouldn't have to ""Retrieve"" the screens every time you go back to the main screen.  Also, I would love to be able to see what else is available to watch (Live or recorded) while continuing to watch a video",No
"there seems to be a bit of a delay, but that may just be from streaming. Otherwise, great download!",No
so inconsistent.  I have a gigabit internet service and this still buffers.  When it works its great but its very inconsistent.,No
"Outstanding app, works great on my Samsung phone, please update it to work with tablets",No
Would be great if they broadcasted the same games as the regular NBC station. Can't get local NBC station with fire stick or PlayStation rue.,No
"Great app that I frequently use to tune into all my favorite events.. Huge Philadelphia sports fan, especially the Phillies, keeps me invested..",No
Very buggy and freezes a lot. The availability of the events are really great however especially with the Olympics.,No
"Total garbage. It offers nothing without a cable subscription. I'd gladly pay for the app if I could watch live events or even replays without having to have cable. The Olympic Games are great, but this app isn't.",No
"Was great but quit working, too bad.",No
Keeps freezing otherwise it would be great...,No
Works great!,No
The product had a great useability and serviceability feel to it .,No
Awesome because I can watch anywhere and don't need cable.,No
Great app.,No
I didn't like they general announcers. Loved skating ones though,No
"I haven't. Chance to watch much sports, but I have always loved NBC!",No
"Clunky interface, random commercial insertion on replay events, poor search interface on replay events, and loading screens are why I will only use this NBC Sports interface if I can't hook up my laptop to the TV for some reason.Also, I really do appreciate the fact that NBC is allowing Olympic viewing on replay but the interface is not very friendly.  Please go back to the interface that was in use for the last Summer games.(EDIT) I have upgraded my rating after looking at the Fox Sports Go app which has no replay of previous events.  Looks like illegal straming from a dodgy website will be in order for the World Cup this year.  Awesome job Fox (sarcasm) to make this app look like 4 stars instead of 2.",No
"The South Koreans apparently did an excellent job of hosting and producing the games. The opening ceremony was awesome and the venues seemed to be world class.  However, the NBC coverage, seemed more focused on celebrating the NBC announcers, network, and commentators. NBC seems to have forgotten that it was about sports and  the athletes and constantly injected politics, social issues, and overstated crises with the games or athletes. NBC seemed to repeatedly ignore the immense accomplishments and hard work of the many Olympic athletes from many countries. They blew it by not covering some key races and devoting time to too many fluff segments (e.g Today Show hosts learning how to ski. ). Hopefully, ABC, CBS, or FOX will provide the coverage next time.",No
"I was very excited to hear about this app as it would ease a lot of the watching of the Olympics and finally we really were going to be able to watch every part of every event.  I started on some early weightlifting and we saw 15 seconds of lift, 4 minutes of commmercial which came back with announcers obviously well into some conversation.  Fortunately, that annoying aspect was not occurring near the end of the games, so I suspect NBC reacted to the early criticism.The one thing that would have been really nice was to be able to see a schedule of events (overall and within an event) so that one could more easily find what they were looking for.I look forward to their updates for the 2018 Winter and 2020 Summer Games and will use it to watch various NBC Sporting events as well.",No
"This is the ONLY app I've found on Fire Stick that makes me re-register AND re-select my cable provider EVERY single day I use it. I'm not joking. I'm not exaggerating. Every single time. It is beyond annoying. I love watching skiing, bobsled, luge and skeleton, but I'm so tired of going through the steps that I just don't bother anymore.12/2/2020: Today I finally gave-up on this, and the standard NBC app. Wanted to watch the Baltimore-Pittsburgh game. Not only had to yet again connect to TV service provider, but then the app told it failed to load content. I'm done... Not worth the headache. Finally deleted both NBC apps.",No
"NBC could not care less about their streaming app or the people who pay to watch it's content. Words cannot describe my hatred of NBC Sports and this application but I will try, for the people. First off, it is so full of bugs and glitches that it makes for a truly frustrating watching experience. There is no escape, however, as they have you by the balls owning the exclusive rights to some of the best sporting available.  You will have to sign in and verify your credentials to the app so many times, I have nbcsports.com/activate as one of my most visited websites. Once you've gained access to the content you willing pay for it gets even better. There is nothing quite like waking up at 7am eastern standard time to watch some Premier League football only to have the app tell you it is unable to play this asset over and over again. If you are watching a sport that a decent amount of commercial breaks be prepared to have quick cuts to those commercials, so quick in fact that parts of the game will be cut off.  Also be prepared to see the exact same commercials for an entire year/season. You will be reciting the Liberty Mutual ads by heart in no time. Games will lag so far behind normal game time that you have to actively avoid your phone to not see spoilers. To be clear this not an internet speed issue as I pay for decent download/upload speeds. If you love sports you will find this app as a necessary evil, but it will suck out as much of your soul as possible and then charge you the NBC Gold price doing so.",No
"I needed this app to get hockey back! Overall, I love the app and have no complaints except it was excruciating to log in with my cable service. It took me about 45 minutes to log in with a code on my computer because my internet and cable are on two separate accounts and it kept defaulting to the wrong one. The NBC Sports website wasn't particularly responsive when it came to pairing my Fire TV either. Make sure you log in asap and not wait until a game is about to come on!",No
"The live stream is terrible for big events. It kept buffering and dropping out during the Superbowl, while it operated perfectly during the 6 hours of pregame coverage. For an app that is not free I would expect the stream to be (mostly) clean. I wouldn't bother paying for this app until they can improve the live stream, which sports are heavily reliant on.",No
"This works for Olympics on Fire TV Stick without a cable provider but watch the glitch. Each time the app reopens it toggles in the top left between the logo for this app, and the logo for the standard app which needs a cable account. Pay attention, ignore the other logo. I will add a pic if it goes through with this review.When you are in this app on this device there will be a row with hundreds of live or upcoming events. When the network is showing Olympics on NBC broadcast TV, a box for this will be in the mix of events. That mirrors the NBC broadcast, and will end as the network does. Look at the pic I will try to attach.The majority of the events are raw with no announcers or scoring, but is excellent quality, and some of the practices are shown as well.A similar App on Roku misbehaved badly for me.",No
"I love the Premier League on nbcsports, and SF Giants games, especially on the firestick. It is HD and my comcast is not. I also love the replays. It's fantatic.However I have 2 complaints. 1. There are too many ads in the replays. We wanted to watch US Ice Skating replay and there were so many ads I decided it was not worth it. That defeats the purpose of the ads. And, 2., I have to reactivate it too often to watch replays. I'll get a notice saying I'm not a subscriber even though I'm logged in. I have to sign out,and resign in, by going to nbcsports.com/active and type in a code This is an irritating ""feature"".  Overwall, I still love the PL and quality of shows and otherwise ease of use.",No
"This would be perfect if you could fast forward through previously recorded event. I mean, it looks like you can, it acts like you might be, but no, in the end it dumps you back where you began. I'm using this app on both Firestick and RoKu with the same issue. Other than that, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this app. It is light years closer to what I always wanted for Olympics coverage than anything ever before. Huonestly, I would have put 4 and 8/10ths Stars if I could have.",No
I have never subscribed to cable and live in an area that does not receive any broadcast television. But now my best friend lives around the corner and she likes to watch the Patriots. We were so happy to be able to stream Thursday's game through the Fire stick even though we expected it to be available with Prime.The stream did hang up a couple times and some times we got some pretty low resolution. I'd like to see more diversity in the advertising. Hopefully advertisers will realize us cable cutters will stream games. I'd even pay a small amount to continue to have few commercials and more content.,No
sure needs improving. I had a hard time finding what I wanted to see and then if I had to turn it off for awhile it would not start where I left off. so had to fast forward several hours worth of video. I havent been able to watch the last several Oympics because I could never figure out when what I wanted to watch was coming on so having it on line has been very nice and maybe in four years it can be improved.,No
"We downloaded the app but when we tried to use it, you have to sign in with your tv provider.  Well we use an antenna, that we bought off amazon and love, however, there is no option for that.  We also have Philo, Netflix and Prime.  None of those were offered.  Don't know what I am doing wrong, but it isn't working for us.",No
"Watched the superbowl via the NBC Sports app on our firestick. 4 stars for letting a program that big be free. It was awesome that they provided a live stream for no cost. Most companies wouldn't dream of doing that, so I was very impressed. That said, we had it running on another tv at the same time pulling from an actual cable company and the NBC app was significantly behind, by like 30 mintues or so, so that was a bit of a let down. But again, it was free, so I'm not complaining. Just a little inconvenience when you want to have it running in two rooms at once (living room + kitchen). I'll continue to use the NBC app though as long as it stays free like this. Thanks, NBC and Amazon!!",No
"The complete and total bias of the ""expert"" commentators, especially Chris Collinsworth, was absolutely reprehensible!!!!!!!!!  I wanted to watch the game, with no preference either way of what team won.  The butt-kissing  of the Patriots, and Collinsworth's love affair with Tom Brady was sickening!  At one point, Brady seriously underthrew a pass and Collinsworth remarked that he ""did it on purpose"".  I may be a girl, but I grew up in Cleveland and I KNOW FOOTBALL!!!!!!!!  From the comments on all of social media, I am far from the only one!!!  Commentators at a high school football game are more professional.  This was a GLOBALLY televised game.  NBC should be ashamed!!!!!!",No
"This reviews deserves ZERO stars, but I think I must post at least one!!This has been a HUGE disappointment!! We went through our Dish connection -- which took two days and many trials.The coup de grace was last night... We were trying to replay/watch the mens' figure skating final.  The transmission would go from high def to low web and back again.But the best part was when we got to about the 2 hour appoint of the 4.5 hour program! The transmission would suddenly show ""end of program""!! So we had to start from the beginning, fast forward to the point where we were, watch more (typically 5 - 10 min), the program would ""end"" again, and ou little game would start over! After 20 - 30 trials of this my wife and I gave up on NBC. That's it for us and this winter Olympics!Oh! And I am sure someone will say we have a bad internet connection, right? Well, we tried this over at least three separate connections over several days, so our adventures last night were not unique!",No
I am truly happy that I do not have to buy a full cable package. So that I can enjoy bike racing around the season.But the TDU was spotty at best not able to access the a given race that day but playback was not available till the following day.Coverage commentators  and picture were almost flawless also distance from that continent may have caused problems. I Miss Paul------------,No
"We love Alpine World Cup skiing! However, we will not be renewing because we prefer our events commentated.  We can watch on the Olympic Channel rather than paying $$$ for this app.",No
"NOT FOR CABLE CUTTERS! - Requires contract with a TV provider and still displays ads. - Does not offer subscription for only this content, must have a provider.  Nice for the short free preview it gives but ultimately not worth downloading...",No
"Seriously, people who want an app like this mostly want it because we cut ties with the big money hungry cable services. But you cannot USE this app unless you DO subscribe to one of them. This is ridiculous at best, and a waste of time. If you have a Firestick only, don't bother with this download. Complete POS.",No
I started watching it on the Smarttv by Samsung it kept breaking up and the sound was not synchronized. I went to my bedroom and turned it on with the Fire Stick. It worked perfect. I would rate it a 5 Star. The Samsung would be a 3- so I averaged the two experiences.,No
"It would be nice if they told you had to have a cable TV provider for this to work. What is the point of having a Firestick if you have cable?I was led to believe this app would allow me to watch the Olympics, NOT the case!I live in an area where cable isn't available, after talking with troubleshooting techs I was told I could subscribe to Sling TV and pay their $25 package and watch all events live. Nope, still need a TV provider and a code to make it work.I would rate a zero if that would have been an option. Very misleading!",No
"This was one of the weakest strems I've paid for. Usability was a challenge. When it stopped showing the main competition, it went to still shots and it was hard to know where things were in the competition next. There was only background sound. The interface was very large on the best of equipment, even with commercial internet from my business. When Supercross went to NBC with this program it lost a lot of viewers and I understand why.",No
"I got as far as downloading the app after trying other places to stream. I couldn't believe the charges to watch a game. I don't really get into it for the entire season so it's silly to spend so much. It would be nice to spend 5-10 bucks to watch while I fold kids clothes....anyway, I never used it, I have no opinion.",No
"using it for the Olympics and find the process awkward. The highlights and full event items are not listed in newest first order, so I constantly have to scroll across to get to the most recent events. When watching a series of clips, sometimes the app sends me back to the first one in the list instead of continuing forward. Some events have no commentary which is either nice, or difficult if you want to really understand what is going on. It is fair but not fantastic. I feel a little let down.",No
"I realize it's a ""free"" app, but a commercial every other minute?  And the same commercial time after time?  It makes it hard to watch the events, especially fast paced ones. And the fact that you have to have an actual cable subscription limits its use tremendously for those of us who choose not to have cable (that's why I have a Firestick and Internet after all). However, the reminder feature is nice and it's a fairly easy app to navigate.",No
While I love this app on my phone and tablet it did not have access on Spectrum.  PRIME did not help for this one.,No
"It's NBC's attempt to do an app.  They're making progress, and I'll say at least this one was usable, which is a big step up from the 2014 Olympics.  Maybe in the 2020s they'll have it perfected enough to earn 5 stars.",No
Clunky interface. Packages are expensive. Hasn't been updated in forever. Like being to made to randomly re-login again and again? Awesome! Forces you to constantly see and deal with sports you don't care about. No way to hide. Video clips only with no easy way to search or organize. Consise information about your sport? Forget about it. Could've been so much more...,No
I used it to watch the Daytona 500 the coverage of was excellent except for pit road where when problems came up for the team's there was a lack up dates or coverage,No
"This is so messed up.  firestick tv is okay at best, but you have to have cable in order to run nbc  sports app.  only wanted to watch LPGA final round live, but since we only stream-wont work. You think they would read all the reviews and change this because the reviews are as bad or worse than min!!",No
The filming is fantastic but female reporter Donaldson said shameful remark to Canadian female curler when she accidentally made an error that was t even a penalty. She said ì...she needs to go to the eye doctor for better visionî. Very poor on national TV.Also too much reporting on US athletes. I watched the summary reviews and other nations that came in 1st were not shown. Other countries report more equally.,No
"Not to happy with them!My wife and I love the ice dancing and figure skating and guess what , NBC put it on their cable channels which I don't get . Others have said the same thing ,greed ,greed ,greed and nothing live ,  I do like to watch either way but when your phone or the news lets you know a day ahead ,well it sucks .Ps ,why do I have to listen to a Aussie lady and not American commentator ?",No
"It gave a free 30 minutes preview, which was nice of them. It looks like you have to have a cable service to use this app, which is the reason I have Fire TV.  So, this app is worthless to a cable cutter like me.",No
"Tried to use app during the Olympics and it was absolute garbage.  Froze every two seconds, and then would buffer.  And buffer.  And buffer.  I have an excellent internet package as well, so I know it wasn't my internet.  Ended up barely watching anything of them due to the low quality of this app.",No
I LOVE the fact that I can watch NBC so easily on my Element Fire TV; I just despise every aspect of NBC.  I would pay to watch the Olympics if any other network on Earth were showing them.,No
A bit slow and not the best quality but easy to navigate,No
"Many complained about cutting the cord but with the Olympics, I was able to watch the sports I was interested in and not just what the US channels covered because of US athlete's. Makes it nice to pick your sport and also has full replays of missed events. No complaints. Enjoy what sports you want to watch on YOUR terms!!",No
"I've now tried with three different firesticks.  The app works perfectly after the initial install.  After turning off the television and then re-opening the app, it just produces an error message.  Searched online and it seems to be a very common issue that has been around for a long time with no solution.  Fix the app!",No
"It's nice to be able to choose from multiple live events, but the app is constantly buffering. Once the buffering is over, the feed continues from the freezing point(no longer live). Occasionally the buffering just never ends, so I exit out and come back in to the same feed, but now I've missed several minutes because of the constant buffering/resuming.",No
Perfect for watching sports,No
"You would think a company like NBC would have their streaming down.  Too bad it is terrible.  We would have loved to watch the Olympics - we don't even mind the commercials, but when that is all you get to watch there is no point in having the app.",No
Why offer programming that requires a cable provider?  And the free  30 minute 'preview' of Olympics is a joke.  The point of subscribing to Prime is for watching programs and movies without the cost of a cable service... a d a delay is no problem. Would love a response from an Amazon official as to the benefits.,No
Buffers or freezes every few minutes. Always seems to be a commercial at random times or right when thereís about to be a big play. Wish these networks would put out quality apps with the seemingly endless budgets they have. Amazon streaming is the best out of all them.,No
It was ok at best,No
"It would have been nice to have been able to watch the Olympics, but it's not worth $100 just for one month (assuming I could get just 1 month), so I was looking for online access. I guess my local sports bar will get my money.",No
There seems to be a lot of lag in Olympic coverage but I love the features!,No
Awesome,No
WE HAVE THE AMAZON FIRE STICK AND IT'S NOT THE BEST. IT STALLS A LOT.  SO HAVING THE APP REALLY HELPS. ALL THOUGH WE DIDN'T GET TO WATCH THE LAST 30 SECONDS OF THE SUPER BOWL.  APP STALLED TOO.,No
"This is one of those bad Apps which require you to have a subscription to a cable service / provider, not that there isn't any content, just that what's available is not the best.  I actually have a subscription to NBC Sports through my laptop but that's pretty useless here.",No
Love live streaming. Wish it were easier to surf other programs on NBC networks.,No
It was nice to be able to watch the Super Bowl for free but it was a nightmare to stream it. It  constantly stopped streaming and the app had to be closed out and reset to continue to watch.,No
Iíd love to watch actually reporting and not commentary by non athletes,No
"Have the tv service so that's not the problem (that's just common sense, the tv providers are not going to offer FREE tv...) my problem is the terrible quality. Perfectly fine with internet and connections, but NBC can't figure out how to correctly stream a game for 5 minutes without it buffering or loading",No
"For those of us who have cut the cable (or dish) and gotten the Fire TV, this app is worthless. It would have been nice to watch the main NBC channel during the Olympics, but not even that seems to be possible.",No
"I love the wide variety of Olympic sports we can watch at any time. Unfortunately, the segments constantly pause to load which is annoying as hell. It often wonít load the app at all when you try to launch it and you have to ìRetryî multiple times before it starts finally.",No
"This app is a nice idea for the Olympics, lots of coverage on there. You have to log in with your cable provider, no problem there. However, the viewer is clunky, it's almost impossible to fast forward AND ypthere's literally a commercial every 5 minutes and they are the same commercials. The IOS app did not have so many commercial. Please improve this app!",No
My husband loves football and NBC Sports delivered the wildcard football game last week. As long as we can see NFL football on this app I will keep it,No
"Love the convenience (my friends are jealous that I can choose to watch the equestrian events whenever I want).  Love that it's complete coverage, not just the blip or two you might get lucky enough to catch live.  Not cool that it freezes up a lot and you can't just pick up where you left off if you can't watch all 3-4 hours of a segment in one sitting (otherwise, it would be 5-star).",No
I would say the app works perfect but it doesnít. My boyfriend and I were watching an intense football game the other night and it just stopped working on us. Eventually it got to the point where it wouldnít reload either and we couldnít finish watching the game or anything else on the app either. Very disappointed.,No
For sports lovers I recommend it,No
Excellent programing!!,No
"Tends to be buggy, but it streams HQ. Loading time is on the longer side for the streams, but once you get it going, it doesnt drop or lag. Can stream the nbc, nbc sports or bravo broadcast. Can also do a la carte broadcast (things that are not on TV). It might be slightly behind the live tv version, but hey, if you dont have cable or want to watch things not being broadcasted live on TV, then this is your best bet!",No
If I could actually stream a whole game without having to back out and go back in or having the app crash every 5 minutes it would be awesome,No
"Nice app.  My only complaint is the rewind/fast forward function.  It would be nice to see what I am speeding past so I know when to hit play again.  Other than that I am 100% satisfied.  BTW, your Indy Car coverage is fantastic !  Thank you.",No
Not what I call as sports lover liking to choose.,No
only downloaded it for olympics. I'm sure avid sports people would love this,No
love it,No
"Apps are the best to watch sports. Resolution is crystal clear, broadcast tv canít come close to the clarity",No
"I love that I can watch games on my FireTV, but a little disappointed that I can't on my mobile device.",No
"it was nice to watch the thursday night football game on the amazon fire TV. However, the game was spotty and seemed to buffer a lot, it finally just quit loading and we turned off the game. Frustrating for a football game.",No
"Once you figure out how-in-the-heck to set this darn app up, then to navigate through its clunky less than clear listings with the Fire Stick functions (Unless you can speak in tongues, don't even think about trying to use the Fire Stick's voice function!)--It turned out to be a really cool app.  I like the equestrian sports, but could I find them on regular TV?  No such luck!  NBC's Joy Reid even said she was looking forward to watching an event at 4:00 p.m. on a Sunday afternoon...Well, I hope she saw it live because I never did!  However, I was able to download and watch the replays to my heart's content!  I would add that the picture was fantastic.  You still have to put up with commercials that it seemed like you couldn't skip and some really long intermissions that you could FF through, but hey there's never a totally free lunch so OK.  The commentary was the real deal, just like you were at the show, without any commercialized hype so that was a fair tradeoff.  My only other gripe was that I have two ""smart"" TV's, but it appears that my other TV isn't quite smart enough to even get the regular NBC Sports app because it doesn't even come up on my prime list of optional apps.",No
I love sports!,No
"You have to have an account with a provider to use this app, would be nice to say this before you download.",No
"The whole point of FireTV is not to pay crazy cable prices. So why have an app that you can't watch, unless you have a cable subscription. THIS IS THE DUMBEST THING THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!",No
"Loved watching the Olympics Opening Ceremony without all the annoying commentary!!!Streaming sometimes glitchy, but overall a much better option than most live broadcasts of the olympics thus far.",No
Better menus would be nice but works pretty well for me.,No
Shame on NBC....Prematurely launched this app.My husband was set to watch The British Open...but many streams are blocked by Parental Control messages. (We have NO controls set up). Spent an hour and a half with Amazon Fire TV tech support-they are amazing!!!!!!  But still unable to watch live streams.Very disappointing.,No
"It was nice to have the Superbowl on our second TV, but the streaming was about 4 minutes behind cable; therefore nobody wanted to watch that  TV.",No
Shaun White - bestNot enough coverage - worst,No
"Pretty much a joke. Having to link to a cable account to watch a streamed feed is pretty sad. If I had a cable account, I would just watch it there.I would love to have the ability to just throw an antenna up and watch it the old fashioned way but, living in Alaska has its drawbacks.",No
Love having the ability to watch all of the Olympics not just what the American stations want us to. App works fine outside of a few pauses.,No
I would have probably loved it. But it wanted me to put in a code and what service i have well I use Amazon prime. And I couldn't watch it. So made me really upset...,No
"I have had many problems with this program, I guess it may be my provider's fault. In spite of the problems the image quality is excellent.",No
"I'm disappointed with the quality of the feed. HD? Movies, shows and other channels are clear and crisp but for some reason this app isn't. My internet speed is excellent. ??",No
Best sports channel ever.,No
Free Superbowl coverage was nice.  But the app constantly froze and skipped half of the superbowl commercials.,No
Some content is blocked when using Spectrum (Charter) Cable. Would be nice if blocked content was flagged before clicking.Would be even nicer if the children running NBC and Spectrum would play ball with each other ...like they do in the Olympics.,No
Picture quality could have been better.  Probably 720p at best. But was glad to watch a game with the Amazon Firestick vs fighting for cable box.,No
"In 3 hour continuous play during a live SNF game, the app shut off at least 6 or 7 times. Frustrating at best",No
Itís ok but not the best for me,No
Love it,No
It was free to watch the Super Bowl which was nice. But stream had to keep buffering. Announcers were obviously patriots fans instead of letting the officials do their jobs.,No
Nice,No
Love this application but just three stars until 4K Ultra HD implementation,No
Love the amount of viewing options. The app is VERY slow to load and frequently stops to buffer .,No
"Nice,  on point",No
I was super excited this came up to be able to watch the Super Bowl live and even host a party! The best part is that it was free!,No
"Would love to give them more stars, but we weren't able to watch past 30 minutes due to not having a cable subscription. We pay for internet service through AT&T, but apparently that's just not enough money for them to allow us to watch more than 30 minutes. I blame both NBC and AT&T for their inability to offee a free stream option.",No
I got this for my roommate; I am not a sports fan. She might love it!,No
"I have a Fire TV stick because I cut the cable cord. Amazon sent me an email today that I could watch the olympics by simply downloading the NBC Sports app for free! Hooray! Except I need a cable subscription in order to watch it. Boo! You think with the amount I pay Comcast for internet every month they could let something like this slide every once in a while. So nice to have Comcast intenet, but not really be part of the Comcast ""family"". I deleted the stupid app.",No
nice to have few sports - live - I haven't viewed it enough to know what's what yet. I'll keep trying.,No
"I've only used it to live stream the gymnastics, which worked perfectly fine for me.",No
Nice,No
Perfect for my Amaz stick,No
"I believe it would be an amazing app but, when I went to watch WNT Olympic qualifier live it said it wasn't available by my provider when I had already signed in. Completely disappointed.",No
"NBC Olympic App: I wish it wouldn't have to ""Retrieve"" the screens every time you go back to the main screen.  Also, I would love to be able to see what else is available to watch (Live or recorded) while continuing to watch a video",No
Looks like a nice app but you must have a TV provider or it won't work,No
Hard to find a specific time slot. Would be nice to have a 'save to view later' function.,No
Awesome because I can watch anywhere and don't need cable.,No
"Complete joke. Huge Amazon fans here! Spend a ton on Amazon from tooth paste and vitamins to power tools and an amazing Grandfather Clock. Been doing this for over 15 years. About 2 Amazon deliveries a week, at a minimum. The UPS guy is like my best friend....lol. But wow is this a stupid app. I realize it's not necessarily Amazon's app. With this app you have to activate it with your TV provider. We cut the cord from Comcast because they are an absolutely horrible value. Hence FireTV and Sling. So how do we use this app?????? Wow is network TV a dinosaur!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Ripe for huge monster opportunity from a Mark Cuban  type. Com'on Bezos! Here's a hint Jeff, start with  broadband Internet so I can completely dump Comcast, please.Ron",No
I didn't like they general announcers. Loved skating ones though,No
"I haven't. Chance to watch much sports, but I have always loved NBC!",No
"I'm giving this 2 stars because as much as me and my dogs love this app on our Firestick, it continuously kicks me out and says I need to subscribe, though I have already subscribed and paid.  When I go to subscribe again, it tells me I'm already subscribed!  What the heck?  I have already been in circles with their ""customer support"" and I have gone through the actual deletion and unsubscribing and reinstalling and resubscribing and it may work for a day, then it is back to the same thing.I will again have to ask for a refund and unsubscribe.Please fix this.  My dogs and I want to love you.Thank you",No
"I wanted to like this channel...  loved the theory behind it.... and my dogs seem to watch ‚Äúhuman‚Äù TV while we are watching so I thought it would be a success... but the performance of this channel/app was so frustrating. The latency was more than my patience could handle. I would stand there for 5 minutes waiting for it to load so that I could select the right option within the channel... when I‚Äôm running out the door for work, I don‚Äôt want to wait 5 minutes to turn on the TV for my dogs. Clean up the performance, Dog TV. Note: we have a new smart TV and do not have latency issues with ANY other app/channel we use. This IS a DogTV issue and we cancelled our subscription",No
"My new puppy LOVES to watch DogTV.  It's great as long as it's connected.  I have no troubles w/internet connection/download speeds for HBO, Showtime and any other Amazon show.  ONLY DOGTV!  Not sure what the problem is.  A bit irritating when I have to leave the house and puppy is alone and I can't get it to connect.  I end up turning into Animal Planet instead.  Not sure if I will maintain subscription.",No
"I downloaded the app I went with the 30-day free trial I could not get it to work I called Amazon was on the phone for an hour they finally got it to work and as soon as they hung up the phone it quit working.Update, after it quit working, I went to my apps on the fire stick. Dog TV showed up with a box that said launch, I clicked on the link and it has worked perfectly ever since! My dog really does watch it.  This was an error on my part, but maybe this will help someone else out.",No
I personally find dogTV very relaxing however I have not found my dog to be interested. I do think it helps make him less reactive to outside noises and is helpful in that way. Sadly the TV almost always shuts off and says ‚Äúplayback error‚Äù. If it would stay on the whole time I was away that would be great but sometimes even after only an hour it‚Äôs shut off. I have an amazon fire TV so you would think it would work with DogTV and stay on better.,No
"My dogs actually really like this app. They seem less anxious when we arrive back home, and they love the stimulation portions. They do actually watch the tv for a few minutes, and you can see them engaging with the noises they hear. However, today I'm working from home, and I have this on try to to keep them entertained and quiet while I work. Every 2 minutes, there is a ""playback error"". Worthless. I'm glad I'm in the free trial month or I'd be very angry to be paying $10 a month for a non-working service. We have highspeed internet and no network problems. This is definitely a product issue.",No
"We had 2 dogs and recently had to put one down.  Until we get another dog, DogTV seems to keep our dog ""company"" while we are away during the day.  We keep it on the live TV stream for him.  The images on the screen, the sounds, the voices... it seems soothing to him.  Definitely watch the overview/welcome video that explains the science/process involved in the programming.  Very nice that the first 30 days are free, but even after that when it starts costing $10 per month, we think it will be a worthwhile purchase if it helps to keep our dog comfortable without his sidekick.",No
"My bird and dogs love this. I have a camera I check in on them and they will be laying on the couch watching this. Meanwhile, my bird is as well and tweeting away at it. Gave four stars because I feel it is a little expensinve, hence why I not longer subscribe; i cannot afford it.",No
"Our dog loves Dog TV but it stops and buffers all the time and if you are not there with the remote to start it, then it's no use.  If we leave it on when we have to leave our dog home alone, we can check our security camera and it is always stopped within 10 or 15 minutes of us leaving.  It's not our internet since it doesn't do that when we watch a movie or binge watch a show.  Dog TV needs to fix the problem  or we will cancel.",No
"I think DOGTV is a great concept and would love to be able to give it a 5 star rating, however I sometime think they are trying to make the show more appealing to us humans instead of our four legged friends.  Maybe it‚Äôs just my Tamaskan dog Lyka, but she could care less about watching sceneries or even sceneries from a dog‚Äôs Point Of View (POV).  What catches Lyka‚Äôs attention is to see other dogs playing and the more dogs the merrier!",No
"Apparently, this is another channel/app like YouTube TV that makes it literally impossible to unsubscribe.  I love dogs, but I have no idea what content is worth $10 a month to amuse a pet.  I was curious -- I clicked on it and backed out immediately when I saw DogTV was not a free channel, but I bet I'll get charged for it anyway and have to fight with Amazon for the next 6 months to get charges removed.",No
I love this for my dog and she loves watching it but the app crashes constantly. I've been emailing with the support team and they don't seem to know why it crashes but you can see from other reviewers that it is definitely an issue with a LOT of people. Such a shame since when it works it works SO WELL for my dog when she's home alone. If the technical issues are fixed I will definitely change my review to 5 stars,No
"I absolutely loved this app. Have been using since May, however as of last week it has quit working. I get an error message saying I am already subscribed, but the app will not open. I have reset my Fire stick, removed and re-installed Dog TV and still have not had any luck. After reading many reviews, this seems to be a common issue. It's pretty unfortunate as this app was great for my dog.UPDATE as of 1/3/19: Well it got me again! Dog TV managed to function properly for 2 days then ONCE AGAIN suddenly stopped working. Extremely disappointed, when the product works it's great, but I give up.",No
"Dog loved it, the only problem was the price, I wouldnt pay that much for something the dog would probably get bored with, dogs mostly sleep and play, they don't sit around long enough to pay that much for a channel. Our dog watched for a few mins each time I put it on then fell asleep",No
"After about one month of back and forth with their tech support I requested to cancel my account, only to find out it is now just not auto renewed.  So I have a ""streaming"" app that I cannot use for another 10 months.  Loved the idea so I jumped in for the annual subscription price after the trial period - (which by the way worked perfectly, of course).  Buyer beware, very unstable app.  Didn't mind the price tag, if it would have worked.  AVOID, until they can get a handle on the bugs.",No
One of my dogs loves it. He sometimes quietly watches the tv. Sometimes he jumps around and barks at the TV. My other dog could care less about it.,No
"As much as me and my dog love Dog Tv, it simply does not work on the firestick!  I am not sure if it is the same when you get it through your cable company but as of right now it is not worth the investment.  It keeps kicking me out and stating there was an ""error in the playback"", for the monthly fee I pay, I expect this to work. At this point, I am thinking of saving my $ and just playing the 15 hours dog tunes on youtube for free.",No
"Even though I subscribed with my Dish network subscription to date haven't been able to get this channel up and running. ""Never fear when D is here"" found an acceptable alternative, The Pet Collective, the girls just love the station!",No
First let me say that I absolutely love the content in the firetv app for DOGTV.  My dogs are even more well mannered just by having DOGTV on for them.  I use to have other calming stations on for them but there is something better with DOGTV.  Now the reason for the three stars is because I use to have DOGTV through DIRECTV and it ran beautifully and the FireTV app will pause a few times and then go back to the main DOGTV screen.  This doesn‚Äôt help me at all when I leave for work at 20 minutes after it is back on the app screen.  I will update the ratings if the app can get fixed.  Other apps run just fine and don‚Äôt cut off on FireTV.  Please help my girls enjoy DOGTV more.,No
I use to love this channel for my dogs. When I moved I cancelled and then tried to reactive it but when I tried it said I already had a subscription. Then when I went back it still said I needed a subscription. I just saw on Amazon subscription ‚Äúapps‚Äù that I have been billed for this service every month since August.,No
"Unfortunately, I have to give Dog TV 1 star.  Please don't get me wrong, I truly Dog TV!  I am subscribed to it via my cable provider.  My toy poodle Sonny love watching it!  It is just that it doesn't work on my fire TV stick.  It is always crashing and I always have to keep subscribing to it.  It is not accessible to blind users.  I use the voice View feature on my fire stick.  As far as the programing, It is  great and does keep your dog happy, and relaxed.  I really hope that they do fix the app soon.",No
"Crashed as soon as I started it on my Fire TV, and every time after even after rebooting my TV. Not worth downloading and wasting your time trying to get it to work on a Fire TV. I do have a trial subscription to DOGTV, it appears to only work in the Silk Browser through DOGTV website, too much trouble starting the browser and logging in, although my pup appears to love watching it. Too bad this company doesn't invest any effort in a easy to use Fire TV app.",No
"My grand-dog loved watching this station. He watched it whenever his family went out. Sometimes he watched it with his family together. I think it's a great station. However, when I tried to set it up on my TV, for some unknown reason to me, I had a frustrating experience and was not able to watch it. I've found an alternative. I'm sorry.",No
"I have used this app/channel for a couple of years now. It has always worked great. I am using it on the newest FireTV, and as of late it has been randomly stopping play. I like to leave it on for my dog while I'm at work. Every day I have come home and the app is no longer playing and my FireTV has gone to sleep. I will not continue to pay for this subscription if this does not get fixed.",No
"My dogs love Dogtv. Unfortunetly had to cancel due to financial issues. But when i subscribed again through firestick, everything is locked. I cant view the videos my dogs like. Meanwhile i've paid for the month and i havent been able to play it live. I recommend you dont subscribe with firestick. Just go to their website and create account. Amazon is no help with this issue",No
My pupper loves to watch other dogs run around. Pretty entertaining seeing him react to them on TV!,No
Loved the idea of it however... it would time out. I would come home to it not playing and a error.,No
My pet loves this channel it just does not hold his attention very long maybe five minutes 10 minutes at the Max and he knows when he comes on he sits down and watches TV but it doesn‚Äôt allow you to do much more and he six months old,No
"I like the idea and the engagement is nice, but the constant interruptions to the streaming made it too inconsistent.",No
I loved what it could do for my dogs since I work and they are home alone during the day.  I was surprised to see that it has a monthly fee.  My husband was not willing to pay the fee.,No
"My dogs LOVE Dog Tv.  However, even after subscribing, it has a lock on all paid content and asks me to subscribe.  If I click on subscription m, it says I already paid.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  I can not get it to work.",No
This would be great for a dog. But I accidentally downloaded it and I do not have a dog.,No
"I could not leave it on to play because it would come up with an error after 20 minutes or less.  If it worked it might be great, unfortunately, it did not work for us so we will stick with YouTube.",No
Not paying $10 a month for 1 Chanel. But my dogs love dog tv.,No
"My dog loves watching this but unfortunately it only works about 10min at a time before saying ""error has occurred"" and kicks us out. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling but it always does the same thing. Great app but terrible functionality. I guess we'll just resort to putting on youtube videos!",No
"I would have loved to see if my dog liked it before I subscribed, but the app is completely worthless without a subscription.",No
Not free. In order to see any content you have to subscribe/purchase.Great in theory,No
"My dog loves dogtv I have seen big improvements however he has not been able to watch it because it says I can‚Äôt access this subscription. But when I try to purchase it, it says I‚Äôm already subscribed. This has been a nightmare and I cant figure out how to log back in so for that I give it 3stars",No
"Dogs LOVE it. However ... have been experiencing ""playback error"" for the past week-ish. Defeats the purpose of all day distraction. Sofa paid the price.",No
A free trial would be nice so I could see if it actually calmed my dogs before soending money.,No
Dumbest rip off ever,No
it's cute and our dog loved the sample but too expensive to subscribe to,No
Brody loves dog tv!  I like knowing he has something to keep him occupied when I need to be away for a bit.,No
Was pleasantly surprised when i came across this app and thought it would be great for our pups while we're away.  Then i needed to pay to activate it.  Why would i pay a monthly subscription for this to be a baby(dog)sitter.  Nuts!!!!  I just deleted the app and moved on.,No
"Concept is great and the one time I got it to work, it did seem to attract the dogs' attentions and calm them.  However, I was only able to access it once on FireTV.",No
"Have to pay a subscription,  disapointed. Wish it was free dogs loved it.",No
Love Dog TV and our dogs love it too!,No
"I love dogtv, just don't like to pay for it.",No
"I did not mean to order this , Hopefully I won't be charged ,I do love the channel but already pay for it through the Dish",No
My brother loved it. But his chihuahua Baxter guves it only one paw,No
Nice and relaxing,No
"The music is very nice relaxing smoothing to your soul, And it's for Dogs. Love those vudeis",No
There was only like 3 minutes worth of free programming and it was just previews of the regular programming. And some videos about dog adoption. Everything else comes with the $9.99 monthly fee. I thought it would have lots of programs for dogs but it would been nice to know how limiting it was before downloading.,No
"Free app only offers samples. App is geared for paid content only. Love the concept. Not the greed. As an animal lover and dad to an amazing dog, would love to see some altruism in the app in the form of free usable content.If the app offered something for non-subscribers, it would be worthwhile. For now, deleted off my Fire TV.",No
I wanted to love this I truely did! But it requires a subscription which totally sucks because my dogs were really excited... One star,No
My dog was not that entertained by DogTV. Not sure why he loves AFV. DogTV not so much.,No
"Love the content....when it works. I have a firestick and will turn it on just before I leave the house. I usually still have just a few short things to do before leaving. its about 10-15 minutes before it stops playing and says there is a ""Playback Error"".  Even if I restart it, by the time I get home this same thing is on my screen because it happened again while I was away so my tv is just sitting there on and completely pointless. I know it's not my internet because we can run 3 cell phones connected to our wifi + play xbox on line + watch our firestick flawlessly ALL AT THE SAME TIME. So when I leave my house with DOG TV on and NOTHING else is connected to the internet and the firestick is 5 feet away from the modem and I still get the message ""Playback Error"" I know it has to do with the app/DOGTV. Such a disappointment and a waste of money.",No
"Your app is the best and worst app there is. My dogs love it, but it is completely buggy. It is the only app in the App Store that routinely stops working. The re-subscribe prompt doesn‚Äôt work. I have to re-subscribe, delete and re-install the app to get it working again. You lost my subscription a week ago because of this after it stopped working again only a week after I re-installed it. It‚Äôs beyond frustrating. I watch on Apple TV. Epic developer FAIL. üòä",No
Great content but horrible functionality. Funny how it worked great during my free trial but as soon as I started paying for the service it stopped working,No
Not great .. none of my 5 dogs fond it interesting... but maybe they are just weirdos ... they all loved Cats TV watched it for  hours without moving ...,No
"My poodle's loved the doggie parts.However not interested in seaside, countryside , and most definitely not interested in children or adults playing.If you had kept the dogs and thrown the humans out they would have liked it all the time.",No
Great idea but far too expensive to actually watch,No
Have to pay for this not worth paying out for although lovely music just more expense,No
Love the people care  have two shelter dogs myself !,No
It seems like this is the best screen mirroring app available for Fire TV Stick. It works well screening my iPhone screen on Sony TV. You mirroring pictures on my phone.

"I tried to use this but got a message that said it won't work when Airplay, Carplay, Restrictions or screen mirroring is active.

I was trying to watch my grandson‚Äôs high school football game and it was choppy the whole time through my fire stick. The game was perfect and clear on my iPhone but not through the mirror on the TV.  I got out of it and back on and it didn‚Äôt help.,No
Not great. Kept freezing,No
Worked great but not 100%sure but my girlfriend didn't have any complaints,No

"If I could give this zero stars I would.  It takes seconds to scan your tablet which you would think was awesome but always be suspicious of a cleaning program that takes secs the first time you use it.  If that's not bad it really only ""scans"" even though it says it's a trash cleaner.  You have to purchase a separate app to clean.  I'm pretty sure this is illegal but if I can stop people from making the mistake of even wasting time on this then I've done my job...",No

Seem to work great.. Had no problems since I downloaded. Highly recommend.,No

"It is difficult to give a product like this a fair evaluation when it is installed on a new device that is functioning properly. Temporary files are constantly created and usually mostly eliminated by the programs you are using as they are terminated. Unfortunately not all programs are well behaved and some leave stray temporary data behind. A program that is not properly shutdown can likewise leave garbage behind. The net effect is that the programs have less ram memory to operate in which can lead to slower performance. If this program is performing  as its creator claims, it should maintain a better over all level of performance.  The best way to test how well this program works is to download the free version and run the scan. Write down the results. Periodically rerun the scan (especially if you have down loaded programs, games or surfed the web). If the scan is valid the amount of garbage files should gradually increase. If it appears to be finding an increase in garbage files then it is probably not a scam. If the free scan always gets exactly the same results even after relatively heavy and varied use I would definitely question its worth. Hopefully this procedure will allow you to prove for yourself whether or not this program is a scam.",No

Be careful it dumped my personal videos.Update review: On 10/24/16 I received an update to this app. (I have a paid for app) Nothing has changed, was hoping that or would give e you the opportunity to choose what you wanted to clean. It didn't. I closed it and left it as I do not want it to erase my personal things that I uploaded to my Kindle HD8 again. Therefore I had to change my rating to a 2. I can't recommend this app.",No

"I have several kindle fire tablets from various generations. It works fine on all of them.  It does speed them up. My only real doubt is that it is finding as many ""virus"" files as it claims. I would greatly like to see what it claims is a virus file.  It has already claimed that I have got t or more viruses in the span of under an hour. The speed did not change a bit at that time nor the amount of free memory. The fires run the Linux kernel with Amazon's GUI that is quite locked down so I just find that pretty hard to believe.  It does do the job though and therefore, is well worth the money.",No

Upon noticing this application was designed for Kindle Fire tablets I thought I'd give it a go. On the first scan two viruses were found, cleaned, and eliminated. Today fourteen more were discovered! The process is lightning fast - no long wait. My Kindle Fire is working great.  Plus, I like the fact that this application is providing a higher level of protection for my tablet.

It takes seconds to scan your tablet which you would think was awesome but always be suspicious of a cleaning program that takes secs the first time you use it.

nice software program .. enjoyed!!!,No
"It is difficult to give a product like this a fair evaluation when it is installed on a new device that is functioning properly. Temporary files are constantly created and usually mostly eliminated by the programs you are using as they are terminated. Unfortunately not all programs are well behaved and some leave stray temporary data behind. A program that is not properly shutdown can likewise leave garbage behind. The net effect is that the programs have less ram memory to operate in which can lead to slower performance. If this program is performing  as its creator claims, it should maintain a better over all level of performance.  The best way to test how well this program works is to download the free version and run the scan. Write down the results. Periodically rerun the scan (especially if you have down loaded programs, games or surfed the web). If the scan is valid the amount of garbage files should gradually increase. If it appears to be finding an increase in garbage files then it is probably not a scam. If the free scan always gets exactly the same results even after relatively heavy and varied use I would definitely question its worth. Hopefully this procedure will allow you to prove for yourself whether or not this program is a scam.",No
